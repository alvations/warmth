A Republican strategy to hinder the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight against electoral fraud.
Now, the Brennan Center considers this a myth and claims that the electoral fraud is less common in the United States that the number of people who die as a result of the fall of lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: These new provisions will affect negatively to the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures would undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what is happening in Canada, American states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And in the same vein, a majority of American governments enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that made the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon has spread after the elections in November 2010, which saw the rise of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, during the year 2011 180 bills were introduced that restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, as well as proof of American citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce the periods of early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the ballot and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with criminal records.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present a photo ID.
The State of Indiana was the first to claim it.
The United States Supreme Court upheld in 2008 the constitutionality of the law in Indiana.
Therefore, the Republican authorities rushed to extend the practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, the American people do not have a universal identity document, such as a Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of the American people, that is to say, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo identification issued by a government agency in your state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 without an identity document with these features.
But, often, obtaining the required identity card costs more than a hundred dollars.
Thus, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 per year, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years old do not have an identity document with a photograph.
And there are still more.
Students in many states, more voters to vote for Democratic candidates, they cannot use the photo ID issued by your institution.
On the other hand, those same states allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs that tend to vote for the Republican party to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to make such a requirement.
From 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to show that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly limiting the Hispanic vote.
It seems that two out of every three Hispanic voters support the Democratic party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers supported in 2011 certain laws that abolían voter registration on the day of the ballot in eight states.
In addition, limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service to help voters who wanted to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, the voter registration campaigns contributed to the record of about 10 million people.
The measures taken since 2009 ensured that the rate of registration of new voters to fall in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other states that favoured the reduction of the period of advance voting.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter do not represent more than 13% of the voters of the state.
In the case of Hispanics did exactly the same thing.
These do not represent more than 11% of the electorate, which is equivalent to 24% of citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who account for 76% of the electorate, do not represent more than 46% of citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, the congressional Democrats and their supporters have been fervently opposed to the adoption of laws that restrict voter registration.
In this sense, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The public prosecutor of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
Was, in part, to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law that required the presentation of an identity document with a photograph.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted, because it is clear that they intended to influence the outcome of 2012 in key states.
A report by the Brennan Center 2011 shows that the states that have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at the level of electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
One thing is certain: These new provisions will affect negatively to the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures would undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: Does Getting the test or not let?
In fact, the PSA test has, on occasion, erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it was decided to hold unnecessary medical interventions.
It is a more than sufficient reason to doubt the men, already reluctant in itself, whether or not they should be screening tests.
Does Getting the test or not?
We have asked for advice from two specialists.
In studies in the United States found a high rate of infection among groups of shows, so it is difficult to interpret the data and make recommendations firm.
For its part, the European study showed a difference in mortality among patients who had carried out the detection and those who do not.
The study, with a follow-up to the age of 12, also showed that exists between 30 and 40% chance of developing metastases if there has been a screening test.
I recommend, therefore, the test at the age of 50, or 40 years if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
African American men have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are nonchalant.
It is really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the riskiness of his cancer, he must offer all possible options and not necessarily to treat prostate cancers that do not jeopardize the long-term life, in which case you should opt instead for an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been detected a cancer are not treated, because the cancer is not aggressive and poses a risk to their lives.
Instead, they suggest an active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer a treatment.
"We find increasingly precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that you do the test in any case.
But it is important to talk with your doctor to determine whether or not the test should be done.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of the investigations, the adoption of healthy living habits remain the best way to reduce the risk of suffering the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, it could prevent 30% of cancers.
"If no one to smoke, that rate would rise by at least 50%," stresses André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we evaluate that around 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking continues to be a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is associated with 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
Greatly harm people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said the spokesman Andre Beaulieu.
An encouraging statistic: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they added.
The food
The agency recommends, too, limit the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they climb the risks of suffering a colorectal cancer.
Meat products should also be avoided.
The conservation of the meat for smoking, salting or drying can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"Can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer," he explained.
The vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between cancer and vitamin complexes.
However, for the moment their research is not conclusive.
Structure the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one of them was found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another what we observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D in cancer has not been able to determine with clarity.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about the concerns and family history of each with your doctor.
"Do the screening test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs bosón in detail
The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs bosón likely generated a great shock last summer, and with good reason.
It is believed that this bosón is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, the particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model: Our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists is not entirely clear that it is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that looks a lot like the Higgs bosón predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major conference of physics held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although there are still more data to be completely safe.
Anyway, we assume that it is Higgs, because the chances of being wrong are few. We will see what it is.
There are, in this great world, an inescapable and pervasive law, which means that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to violate this rule and don't try too much, because it will end up getting hurt.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that it is also an act of these characteristics: The Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists basically of some of its features.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we find the good citizens called fermions, which wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And on the other are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who has no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories, which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: Those taverns, of which we will not discuss here, and the "force particles," for which the great forces of nature are spread and with which the Higgs bosón would be somehow related.
These bosons, it should be pointed out here, are not the exotic creatures that we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this story, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal bosón: The photon or "light particle" which acts as a "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, "mess up" the electromagnetic field at that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" is an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a photon; that is to say, one of the bosons "force carriers."
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs bosón, with the difference that this is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "messy" so that this bosón appears.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field to activate it, you need to arrive at extremely high energies, a bit as if it were an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slip through the surface.
That is why we need a huge particle accelerator at the CERN (the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 kilometers in circumference!) to reach such levels of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
Indeed, not all particles and all the materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, they do, but others do not: A piece of paper, for example, will not by itself never stuck to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: Those who do have a mass, while the rest (how the photon, by the way), do not have it.
But what "can provide" all these investigations?, asks the Lady Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and allows, in addition, that physicists escrutinen differences between observations and predictions of the MS.
For their part, many are strongly desire, because the slightest difference could open the door to a "new physics" that tape some holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation concerning the seriousness (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of matter in the Universe (another ups!).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far.
Impact of
The impact of such research in our day-to-day are difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that will not have any.
To see: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in laboratories not suspected at all the revolution that its work force.
Entreveían scientific applications, but nothing more.
Indeed, as the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where he invented the laser in 1960, which produced the first continuous laser (pulsed) were the first in 1962, initially the laser was considered a "laboratory apparatus."
Just imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the surrounding instrumentation for research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle produced a light sensor in 1969 in the course of his research in the field of optics.
Despite the fact that it was not at all its original intent, this probe is now "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die... | Le Devoir
The Commission on Dignity in Dying, Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate must be joined again soon as it prepares a bill.
However, within this essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir has tried to see it closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
Prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a breathing space of two years.
"I had been given five years of life, but now I have just seven," recounts, made a pass, lying on his bed in the middle of palliative care Victor-Gadbois of BELOEIL, who arrived the previous day.
"But it is always a shock, we cannot be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc: A huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone, and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, resigned acceptance that help you eat.
Courageous, to smile, to talk to the strangers who will devote attention, we bring medicines and offer a bathroom.
The courage of the ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that I cure diarrhea, it is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found to remedy this evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man does pee standing," recounts Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the center Victor-Gadbois.
Back to his childhood, for some people, it is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the ability of the person to accept such a regression," notes.
Because, in the view of the majority of the people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of this regression.
All patients who enter the centre of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffering from cancer.
They have a prognosis of life of three months.
In this state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative care."
The biggest fear of Mrs A, 89 years, is dying "conscious and drowned out."
But the disease has made him to discover their children.
"I have some good kids," she adds.
"I no longer have more desire in this life," he says, before accepting that he put a mask to help her breathe.
And, in the next few days, a last visit to his son, who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois is offered, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and helps to food.
They are palliative care that we give them when you cannot do anything more.
In order to help his death be more comfortable.
In Quebec, we have a bed of palliative care for every 700 inhabitants.
It is very little, because we know that all we will end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center.
Whether at the level of comfort physical, emotional or spiritual.
He was dying to offer of mouth rinses with brandy or Pepsi, depending on demand.
For diabetics are no longer controls its rate of sugar.
The death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening we serve a beer to Mr X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son was finished beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," recounts Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the centre Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever being equal.
Next to a 94-year-old man who savor their last family reunion in the courtyard, well-placed between their pillows while all drink to your health, a 36-year-old boy tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and their two children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For the past six months, there are always three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years sick of cancer," worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the center Victor-Gadboisarrivent comes from his house and 47% of the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to say, to the care designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient arrives at the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care facility.
And several agencies, such as the center Victor-Gadbois and society of palliative care at home in the Grand Montreal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of patients with cancer.
It is precisely this large relative shortage in health care in Quebec which makes many doctors who specialize in palliative care fear the adoption of a law to regulate euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr Christiane Martel, the health system in Quebec is not competent enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before they agree to proceed with euthanasia.
"Recently," he explained, "I have seen a patient spend 14 days in Spain without suffering great pain has done what is necessary to alleviate it.
I fear that patients want to die just because they do not receive appropriate care. "
And at the same time, many oncologists are stubborn with their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
The hopes of survival of Hélène Richard were already at a low ebb when he left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncóloga who wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that I would like to stop fighting," recounts.
"However, she had told me that there was nothing more to do!"
There is no all-powerful care
Dr Martel believes that 90% of patients seeking to die for their carers who have not responded to their demands once they have been relieved their pain, thanks to a team of palliative care.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home in Grand Montreal, patients do not respond to treatment against the pain in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his death, whether sporadically or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the disease is not relieved will have the opportunity to have that palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved all say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want to alleviate."
The realization of this report has been made possible thanks to a grant of journalism research institutes of health of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, entrepreneurs of the BTP, fundraisers for political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia count, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system," which are part of the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and gangsters.
An "industry" that was too expensive to the taxpayers of Quebec, especially in the years 1990 and 2000.
"It is curious how the system is sprayed once we have hunted for big media," satirises Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible thanks to an in-depth investigation into corruption linked to road contracts in Quebec, the Liberal prime minister of the time, Jean Charest, had not consented to delay.
The report "Duchesneau" established a direct link between the industry, the illegal financing of parties and corruption among officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the ministry of transport would have saved billions of dollars in contracts," containing some of his instincts to stay with a proportional part.
The Commission has already done "Charbonneau fall to two mayors," he adds, while expected to reach "demonstrate the existing ploys behind individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The ongoing anti-corruption unit, created in 2011, also applies to its team of auditors, investigators and analysts from the government.
This unit operates in addition to the officers of the "Marteau," which, since 2009, have made the "sewer" of the cartel of Montreal moderate to inflate contracts.
These past few weeks, the unit has proceeded to record in series of allegations of fraud and corruption charges against municipal as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a town on the outskirts.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec City.
It is suspected that has been repeated pocketed bribes in exchange for public contracts.
It has been charged to engineers of the road network in Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and furthermore, Lino.
The latter has caused shock to the committee to explain the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining government contracts.
He paid for three years, 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a broker linked to the Mafia who transferred the money to Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Furthermore, M. distributed money to right and centre during the years 2000, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberals in power.
He admitted, too, have organized an illegal fundraising for the former Liberal deputy prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation in the cost of the contracts sewage
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles surprenant, exingeniero of public works, explained it perfectly before the committee: In ten years received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes from companies in the construction sector for a total of $736.000, all in exchange for sewer contracts whose inflated costs.
Other officials of the road network have admitted that they received money for inflating invoices between 30% and 40% in false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay had deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled their coffers of dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected policies of Montreal did sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, since 2010 objected to the sale of municipal land acquired for $5 million and resold by 1.6 million to developers in the real estate boom.
The 70% of the money for election campaigns was dirty money
Finally, the investigation will take place, it ensures that pulls a thread "in order to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits."
And he adds that the process is painful, but good. "
We are cleaning the wounds but one would need a clean research unit in Montreal and be very vigilant to ensure that dubious practices will not be repeated.
How to do the cleaning.
He regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for its part, declares that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but is worried especially about the role of the '"elected politicians aware of the ploy."
Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that went to the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, observes: "I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The government proposes to limit Tsao $100 donations to parties, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "while not strictly limit election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics."
It recommends a complete overhaul of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of parties: "We can't get any lower, go to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with a more solid footing, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who are laughing all to look in the mirror.
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
I advance from day to day by his side.
The technical staff also has brought me a lot.
These elements and push me on a daily basis to raise the level of my game.
In a party, that is easier.
Everything is going very fast in football.
But I am not acaloro.
Since my start in the centre of preformación of INF Clairefontaine until my step by Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by leaps and bounds.
It is going to get the benefit of competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
The recruited this summer are used to play games of very high level.
They know that each training is crucial.
That makes a player like me would like to fight and give everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my positioning.
It is supported by deputies as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
But Ancelotti is the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all the technicians.
Today, there is no one equal in the League 1 and is among the best European coaches.
It has a lot of experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think that will be other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a conversation with him very comforting.
I had just emerged from a series of injuries.
The confidence they have in me also explains my good performance.
What does he think about the PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken the post of leader.
But we are still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: We have qualified for the quarterfinals with style.
What is the purpose of the club in this competition?
We are going to try to go as far as possible.
From now on, you can do anything.
But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams.
We want, for a start, finishing the first of our league against Porto in order to receive the return of quarterfinals.
Does the PSG can become a major European club in the short term?
Already has the budget...
In order to become a major European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long term.
Today, this is not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is delivered to their means to make this project happen.
Not to win the cup in the League 1, as in the last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts to lead the title of champions.
In the last season we not far away.
In May, we were a disappointment, because we had the conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We ended up with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we should have been champions.
But another team, Montpellier, had a pretty good season.
This year, I think it will be a good thing.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I believe that we have the weapons to llevárnoslo.
Do you think that the media are more than PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot from us if we think of what has been invested in the players that we have.
We have accepted.
After we win 4-0 at home to Troyes, which still find themselves with things that criticise is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else the people.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are the FC Barcelona!
We try to put in place a project of game.
A team is built with time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Talk to Manchester City, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for the quarterfinals, and they have also invested a great deal!
In view of the sums invested, os imaginaríamos with 15 point advantage on the day.
That would be neglecting our adversaries and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, had been "driven" by this new PSG.
This shows that the League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up taking the trophy.
The PSG seems entirely dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better to say that we have a "Zlatandependencia."
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that puts many goals.
He has come to show that it is the star of the League 1.
And it has shown in all the teams for which he has passed is a great player, a star in the world.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men who are around them.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
It pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to move forward.
How you've lived through the EURO 2012 with the team of France?
It has been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me accumulate game time.
I saw things there and I left strengthened.
Today, play good matches achievement in the selection.
This is what I expected from my baptism with the "blue."
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine, and that is why today we have an exemplary behaviour.
What you have vision of the first month of Didier Deschamps at the helm of the "blue"?
Is getting results.
They are well-placed in the group of qualification for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case of Laurent Blanc.
But I do not want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved its goal of mechanics for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps leads to the selection to Brazil.
The tie (1-1) of 16 October in Spain served to lay the groundwork?
That game gave us confidence.
Each one fought for all.
Before the shock in Spain, had not experienced a game like this in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the contrary to the current monetary exchanges, based on the central banks, identified transactions and processing loads between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technology, the political vision is palpable: The belief that the current monetary system, composed of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible into dollars, euros, etc, and a secure protocol to change the way of BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files on an equal footing.
There have been nearly 200,000 transactions thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And nearly a thousand websites accept the bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The value of the bitcoin, having reached the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to haunt the ten dollars (contributions are censan on page bitcoincharts.com).
There is nothing impressive compared to the global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in him in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, he described the bitcoin as "the most successful" virtual currency, "which competes with the dollar or the euro," and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other systems with different types of virtual currencies such as the "credits," used to move in a video game and that you can win by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes redeem).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But a central authority in all exchange controls and about the changes.
With the bitcoin, all network nodes are both repositories of books, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Every transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses in the form of e-mail.
A user can choose a different direction for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a system of dual-key encryption.
The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes of bitcoins entered in the book of public accounts, which spreads across the network.
The key milestone is to write the new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a sort of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a phase of cubed file, that is, transformation of a large file in a shorter numerical footprint and unique.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "chop up" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zeros at the beginning).
Once you find that number, the other nodes easily verify that is a good thing.
The transaction is then indestructiblemente linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any changes would change the footprint.
If, in order to commit a fraud, a user would pay twice for the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network will accept as valid only one of the two transactions; the other would be left an orphan, as both have different tracks.
The computer that will solve the challenge is 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, the reward is divided into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until cienmillonésimo, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also in every increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Web sites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and robbed bitcoins in deposit.
"The ruling does not affect the same protocol used," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a company in real currency that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of blanquo of money thanks to this anonymous service.
But the cash presents the same defect.
Actors of weight as Wikipedia reject payments of this kind.
Others, such as the platform Wordpress, accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, the Insitito Weizmann in Israel, analysed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins does not circulate.
In November, it launched the "giant cuts."
"They changed $30,000," rejoiceth Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts the bitcoins in gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a book about teaching that currency, believes enough in the potential of this technology in addition to online transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, amounts to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but Bitcoin used to validate transactions, that are cheaper.
The carrier also manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up in the shops, which do not have to install new software or terminals.
You just have to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, which claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while for Bitcoin will prevail, but in 2013 there could be a change," predicts.
On the other hand, in its report, the ECB plans to revalue the various risks, today considered high, in the event that this successful currency.
We come out of Afghanistan.
What happens next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should leave by the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army retake possession of their territory and that Afghans choose their own future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished mainly to Afghan farmers, who have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, wounded and maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former chief refugees in Pakistan, but often also with peasants who reject the presence of foreign troops, as in the days of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes join jihadis, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, they are no longer when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of French troops in the Nijrab base, which I watched from the top of the hills of almond trees planted by French credits, was made to order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without suffering any attack, watched by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul after the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since his irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country engulfed in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
It took control of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
Afghans have paid the price of obscurantism of his peasants overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, gaining government land for resale as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from the pair of huge US outsourcing contracts.
They are discredited; most of them do not have fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspires to a government that is not formed by thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as it will be those who have managed to take advantage of American generosity: Capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of the war and their ideologies.
They have lived in the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With around 65% of its population under the age of 25 years, Kabul has right now with 5 million inhabitants, one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
We need to give work to those young people who do not want to go back to the dark ages of the old parties and the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, are eager for mobile telephones, television and chapbooks Turks with a modern world has great admirers across the country.
The army is now present.
Is it considered legitimate authorities who want to lead the country?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle to reconstitute already concerned provincial militias, will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain degree of decentralization in the image of Western nations, but the United States had wanted to transform into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly during the elections scheduled in April 2014.
However, the country is dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has restored its services, it has not been fixed nor any reservoir have been repaired irrigation systems.
Everything is imported and does not produce anything except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, it would have been necessary to government control.
Spread the rumor that Afghanistan possessed immense mining riches.
And that only added to the feeling that Westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract the copper or iron ore from the ground and with no means of transport for export through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) and the immense site excaven búdico remain there as the largest employers in the province.
It will also require that Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country that largely depend on imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The French troops departed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: Schools for girls, schools for children, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the fields of military, legal, health and agriculture and supporting the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of trying to "win the hearts and minds" and to perform the impossible task of making the aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civilian and military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (CIMIC), abolished in 2012, and he did bring brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, greedy to obtain local labour force, have been able to help contain the insurgency: Irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased crop surfaces.
What we will leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very tough in these valleys often located over 2,000 meters high.
The Embassy received dozens of complaints written with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
For the release of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me that they want, would be required to maintain a small civilian aid, well controlled and reaching them directly.
A constitution with forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives full powers, he decided to play everything.
Caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when it announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the following day.
Only a week ago, the head of state had given two more months to this Assembly to finish their work.
And nearly two years ago that Egypt uses a provisional text, amended several times, which weakens the institutional stability and lead to legal entanglements.
This new initiative has done more to increase the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president is persisting in his delirium "autocratic" and "betraying continues his word" and "trampling the law."
On the part of his supporters, ensures that this is a measure to end faster with the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.
In the next 15 days should organize a referendum.
A very short period of time, which obliges the Brothers to relinquish his project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to recover a popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversial wreaks havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for it, as stated in an interview with the US weekly magazine Time.
Considering that this resource has been voted very quickly, contains an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "I stand by my vote or text or full powers," powers that supposedly will come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamist, the text voted yesterday.
Most of the liberals did not go to the call.
In mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, had closed the door because they felt that they could not assert their points of view.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, yesterday morning was added to 11 people, substitute members, in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As expected, the articles have been voted unanimously.
Commentators makes them grace, on the other hand, the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day has expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the object of all eyes, remains finally identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, they hoped to be able to replace "principles" for "the rules," which would have allowed a stricter application.
For the Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of his goodwill and respect for the other components of the Egyptian society.
Liberals accused him of hypocrisy and feel that it is not more than an advertising trick.
According to them, the Islamisation of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They relate, in particular, Article 220, which gives the Al-Azhar University, a consultative role, particularly for anyone who has to confirm their compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, it is troubling because "people called to pronounce is not elected and has no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premises of a theocracy. "
The fears of liberals are further increased by the fact that the next chancellor of the university would be considerably less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no specific religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the marital status.
Most of the lawyers who have been working on this text are not scholars but university students, some of them trained in the French system, "explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity surrounding the article 220, because the terms employed imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent civilian judges are competent to rule on top of all of this. "
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received a lot of criticism that relate to the extended powers that gives the president of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will argue that there are few compared with those who were under the former regime.
Another sticking point: The powers granted to the military.
According to the desire of the military, the review of the defense budget will not be subject to Parliament, but to a national council of defence.
Nor will be banned prosecutions of civilians in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights.
They also showed their concerns relating to the text, which they consider liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy remains and, from now on, the insults are banned, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially in the press.
In addition, any article emphasizes the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with Article 36.
The word did not appear in the Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was supposed to leave last night on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, the Ukrainian tourists await the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comforts and a pristine nature.
"IDA" identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enter into this "baptismal font" will receive the divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: The conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the water, the calming of the storm and full networks.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the largest number of holy places in Jerusalem.
The Cross will travel here believers or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Via Dolorosa").
It begins in the Fortress of Antonio, the Pretorio, where the trial was held, and continues through the streets of the Old City, the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the site of the crucifixion, the Piedra de la Unción and the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built on the spot where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree that became the cross for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the holiest site for Jews, the Wailing Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leaves here notes with their wishes, which then will become a reality.
A vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada fortress was what was left of a secret refuge against the enemies, that Herod the Great built in the year 25 BC for his family.
Found in the cliffs of mountains at a height of 450 metres above sea level.
And get there by their own means, they can only those who engage in the escalation.
Others may come to this historic summit in the cable car.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 metres is the famous ski resort Hermon, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
There, at the foot of the hill will offer bus services.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, at the top of the mountain supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Unique visit museums
In this country there are about 300 museums.
In a single trip, you can't visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It preserved the ancient Dead Sea scrolls or 42 of Qumran, discovered in caves in the Judean desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his painting exhibition features paintings of expressionists and impressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the museum-bath Al Bashi, which are some old Turkish bath rooms with model figures of visitors and swimmers of that era.
In Caesarea is worth passing through the exclusive private Ralli Museum, where you can admire the sculptures by Rodin and Dali.
There are no tour guides and souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and categorically does not accept donations.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in the concentration camps and the gas chambers.
You get into it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And sound the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries where they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health care
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, museums and oceanographic delfinarios.
It is curious that in the Red Sea a kilometre even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall in the 21 degrees and the air is heated up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there bathe throughout the year.
By the way, the sea, the most remarkable in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily argue to those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes of the surroundings are truly beautiful.
People come here to take courses of treatment with salt water, brine and healing mud and fortify your health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and to put in order their broken nerves.
Touching the mysteries of the
The retains the old part of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
It was the famous maritime route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built the ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you tap on the walls in the streets of the "same" symbol, you will be good fortune.
In Jaffa you can find pairs of newly-weds people realized that come from all parts of Israel, and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Jerusalem, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre, "take" the strength of the Crusaders.
In the Roman era, Caesarea was the chief city of Judea and the residence of the Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The theater, carefully restored, is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Remember tourists
If you are travelling to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much to be desired: In this country, about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to take it in euros, but in dollar terms, which can be easily changed to shéquels (currently $1-3, 8 shéquels).
Urban transport consists mainly buses, but there are fast tram in Jerusalem and in Haifa is the only subway line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City to the Upper City.
In fact, it is an underground funicular.
Travel in any type of public transport costs 6 shéquels and for that price, you can travel by transshipment during 1,5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Saturday is celebrated the Sabbat.
Since the night of Friday to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed and public transport interrupted their work.
But on Sunday morning begins a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels are only kosher, which excludes pork, shellfish, fish without scales and dishes that combine milk and meat.
It offers a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a great variety of sauces, faláfel, ground chickpea balls, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities are not stray dogs.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that roam "to your taste" so impressive.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
The ronroneadores love crowded places and do not reject the sweets.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, cost $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to the insurance, which goes for $15 per day.
And the rental of a bicycle it on 15 shéquels the day.
The tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shéquels.
Israel in figures
In 2012 visited Israel more than three million tourists from all over the world.
Most of those who came to tour the country and the rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, UK and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that exceeds by 51% at the same rate in the year 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime powered on 9 February 2011.
"The great and powerful" will take you to Moscow: Immigrants save for the language
While deputies and human rights advocates argue about the consequences that would bring the law on the compulsory examination, have already appeared in the country scamming trading with certificates "false"
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its only goal is to earn money to help their families who have been left at home.
Since 1 December a law comes into force, according to which each immigrant labour should make an examination to test their knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who have the intention of working in the field of service delivery, community service agencies, household services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, the tests will be made mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to pay the examination of the language, but also the Russian history and the fundamentals of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language should be confirmed even to receive and to renew the work permit.
Exception are the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.
They will not be subject to this law, people who managed to get their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Utility, doom and defence of the rights
The network of centres examiners will work sponsored by the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the University of Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, the State University of Saint Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to present the evidence in all cities, now in Russia are open more than 160 centres of this kind.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But the defenders of the rights, long before the law came into force, they often make this question to the press: What will bring this into reality?
What changes will bring the requirement of knowledge of the language, both for the Russians and immigrants themselves?
First, are the representatives of the Immigration Service, this will reduce the number of people who suffer from "slave labour."
Many people talk today about defending the rights of immigrants in the workplace, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Federal Migration Service of Russia in Tajikistan.
The defense of their rights must begin before his departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass the medical supervision.
Without understanding the language, says Sebelev, immigrant's future will be doomed to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of help, a lot of my "paid" a shocking and narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"In his homeland promised one thing, but when you arrive are deceived, are deprived of their passports, wages are not paid promised," confirms the head of the Directorate of Immigration Service labour migration from Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't be angry, jefecito!
However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that not only do not know the language of the country to which they intend to go, but also in their own language written with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much his fault, but his own misfortune: Few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, let alone clothe them, calzarlos and buy what is necessary for the school.
When they reach adolescence, these guys venturing to work at the first opportunity.
It is difficult, if you don't know the language, they recognize them.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the law on language, the rights advocates point to an important point.
Tests will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If you do not have that status, there will be no review and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers are still living in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or prohibited the move to strangers.
Many visitors say they receive the official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, the legalization costs money: Twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false registration can be done quickly and by only thousand five hundred rubles.
The employees of the Russian police know that usually carry false documents, we are not registered and there are cases of extortion.
"We are asking for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," commented to journalists on a citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it became clear that not only the documents for registration of immigrants may be false.
A number of "false" certificates of knowledge of the language has already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The forged documents had been printed in standard color printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners, not as a gift: Every immigrant, who wanted to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official review procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that the "diplomas" is not to buy, converge government officials and human rights defenders.
So far, the authorities can promise to immigrant workers who had not been able to successfully pass the exam the first time more time to study the basic course of the language.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with guns registered is quite small
The Ministry of the Interior is proposing to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to the owners of weapons for civilian use.
This is the government's reaction to the recent incidents: Tighten shot during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no casualties, and the massacre started by the Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, squeezing seven people lost their lives.
The police wants to ban the use and possession of weapons traumatic in public places and raise the minimum age for handgun license, 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised to reform the law on weapons possession will be taken to the State Duma in the near future.
Not all are happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hardline policy."
The network has appeared in an open letter, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of handles, demand that it abandon such measures of strict "meaningless."
The percentage of vandalism with use of registered weapons is minimal, commented to the BBC news service from Russia, the criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, for six months of the year 2012 142 crimes were committed with use of firearms registered in organs of the Interior, compared to total 1168 crimes recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that stricter legislation in the field of civilian use of weapons will not be a drawback for the offender is targeted to the black market.
Now, in his words, in Moscow can be found any weapon at low prices.
Meanwhile, in the Ministry of Interior stated that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: From factories to official
The black market of weapons is supplied through various channels.
The main channels are years, says the retired colonel Viktor Baranets, who for 10 years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts orders for weapons
The first, "vestige of the military or army," that is to say, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officials and by the same Caucasians," says Baranets.
The following types of "black" weapon, stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that here include weapons stolen from the warehouses of the police and those stolen directly by officials of the law enforcement bodies.
Illegal weapons are on sale from the military arsenals.
In many military arsenals often had explosions.
"There are versions demonstrated that some of the fires were caused deliberately to cover the shortage," says a exmilitar.
According to Baranets, arms manufacturers also put their bit.
"Now private factories have proliferated weapons that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under rope to the black market, including in Moscow," said the expert.
A further source of the black market is smuggling.
A large number of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There have their own production, sometimes craftsmanship, and has formed a mob that has organized the flow of arms," explains the former military.
Where are the weapons?
Experts have calculated what is the participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on this subject was developed in 2011 by the Center for planning and analysis of problems of governance.
Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and RosStat, criminological literature and public access data portals whose theme revolves around the weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the researchers, from the armed forces and the security forces.
Half of the weapons on the black market has arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to weapons," it says in the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases were stolen during the production of weapons and 5% corresponds to the "illegal" archaeology.
The dependent on one of the stores of weapons, who asked that his last name not be mentioned, said that the weapons found by the illegal diggers not buying anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers are directed at military stores when they need a game.
Through some major, the provider buys a unit, for example a TT pistol.
The removed from the register and pass over the fence.
"It takes the weapon to the city and sold to 900 euros per unit with two chargers," tells us
"But, of course, the police are aware of all the issues, so periodically, when there is to comply with the plan of discovery of crime, carried out test purchases of illegal arms dealers," adds the dependent.
"As in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually be found through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed to me to go to the platform" Begovaya, "where he would be a man who I would lead to a" esquinita "where we could negotiate.
The price of the gun, I learned only there. "
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"I need to get a gun to a friend who has contacts," says the shop assistant: "I have a friend like that, but not much trust in him."
There are sellers in the markets, but there also has to be, say "on the part of Mr Ivanovih, who asked him to say that he had fallen a tooth his daughter."
I can even get a pair of brass knuckles of steel through a trusted person.
He also provides the only to me because he knows that I am not going to week.
Newbies looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Viktor Baranets was put to the test in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was about to publish an article on this subject.
Schemes, according to his words, have not changed.
Gave him a photo album where there was no "everything."
"I felt like in a luxury boutique," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to the words of Baranets, does not offer a pig in a poke: Everything can be proven.
I, as a potential customer, not just buy; we are going with the seller to the forest, where we put a white.
"Give me the opportunity to shoot and when I can assure you that the gun shoots well, we began to negotiate," describes the procedure the expert.
Shop of sofas
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte," where it offers to buy weapons "for different purposes."
This is not required for any document or personal encounters.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the advert "Buy a pistol or a machine gun."
There, users make their orders and put questions.
What sold to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"I buy TT pistol. Moscow," tersely worded his question "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two-handed catch to those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, as hungry fish to the bait, and then to extract coal in Siberia
Military commentator Viktor Baranets exmilitar and
I have heard of these systems: Generally, the website is registered outside the reach of Russian laws.
People the orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
"In response, he sent a photo and instructions to know where the gun is hidden," recounts the press secretary of the NGO "The right to arms," Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets states that if you place an order online, one is left without a weapon and put them in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two-handed catch to those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, as hungry fish to the bait, and then to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov $100 dollars
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to the experts, you can spend $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The right to arms," a Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100-300.
We have to wait a month and a half.
It is sent from military warehouses by middle-ranking chiefs.
According to official statistics from the ministry, compared with the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia fell by 7%, which is 22,900, and the number of identified cases of robbery and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Employees are on strike of fast-food restaurants and supermarkets in the US.
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as a cashier at McDonald's ""
In recent days, the United States has initiated a wave of protests against low wages paid in supermarkets of the Walmart corporation in the popular restaurants and fast food chains, such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken. "
For now, no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will arrive at the nine points, or if you are destined to lose strength and amansarse in its early stages.
The protest actions are supported by the unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages earned by employees of Walmart and the fast-food system, the goal of the organizers of the protests is the creation of trade unions of workers in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
How Forty-six cents a year?
The action began last week, the day after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday." That day, in the United States coomenzaba orgy of cuts that captured million inhabitants, and that sometimes was accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some workers of the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and picketed to protest alongside the trade unions and left-wing activists in the shops of the corporation, whose products are aimed at people with modest incomes and moderates.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and batteries for cars, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than the larger supermarkets.
That is why many workers underpaid Walmart buy only at work.
The availability and the range of products made from Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to the words of two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at a very low price, in part because it pays little to its workers.
They also complain about the bad working conditions, such as the lack of a forklift or hand scanners.
This "Black Friday" participants of the rally demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation spent $30 to $100 per month.
For a typical worker of Walmart, which receives 9.5 dollars per hour, this expenditure is excessive, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary up to $12 per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is approximately 1.1% more than it spends on wages now.
If Walmart puts wage increases on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will be only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend a ridiculous amount of $has more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters say satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and that did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" lasted in its stores from 8 o'clock in the afternoon of Thursday until midnight the following day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, their tills made the "Black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.
The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing Web site Huffington Post, who left his job "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest had been nothing more than "a public relations stunt," organized by the union workers.
"Free Box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the goals were not exactly Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city have no appreciation, and so for now there are none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
But McDonald's says it sells billions of pieces, and then not even give you the sick leave and don't pay for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the Municipal Council of New York
Currently, in accordance with federal law and New York, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
The fast-food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive in New York 8.90 dollars per hour.
No one earns less than them in this city.
How is it possible to survive in New York with this money, it is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers passed by the McDonald's and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, while still living with their parents.
Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there a long time.
Now, constantly stumbling in some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know what to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 Thursday morning at the McDonald's of the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and fast-food cooks are starting to pay at least $15 per hour, or that they were double the current minimum wage.
They also demanded that the fast food industry create workers' unions.
The US law prohibits the administration to prevent them from this right and punish the activists of the trade union movement with skulduggery and redundancies.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy to cover the food sector unions ra.
One of the main is the excessive staff turnover.
Discordant,
Noisy protests took place on the same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at the McDonald's located near Times Square, attended by several local Democratic politicians, in particular the member of the Municipal Council of the city Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it is selling billions of portions, and then even gives you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters received support from other prominent Democrats in New York, for example, the candidate for mayor of the city, Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support workers in the fast food industry to achieve receive fair wages and economic prosperity that it deserves every New York."
As described by the New York Times newspaper, this was the largest demonstration of its kind in the history of American fast food.
But there were only a few hundred people, even if not all of them were employees of the fast-food service, in which trabakan tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to cause a mass movement.
"For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy."
The subject of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, lately is perceived as normal primarily through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference Google showed a model in motion and then, in November, it was revealed that Microsoft had also submitted an application to claim the relevant patent.
However, in a conversation with the head of the group of 3D interactive technology on the Microsoft lab in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, determined that for scientists of the company, the glasses already belonged to a bygone era.
They are attracted by the prospect of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and the creation of virtual spaces open.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of his research group?
- We are dedicated to human-computer interaction, but also trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
For now, humanity as a mass has been trapped in the stage of work with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes plays with his finger.
But we want to look at 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today is sold without any Xbox Kinect, because all they are interested in the gesture control.
- What more of what the future holds?
- Despite Kinect interaction has led to the physical level, much of it still occurs in a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we work in a truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including the design.
We must rid the world of computing to ours, the physical, making it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds it.
Then we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a more convenient way.
Firstly, to hell with those stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about the control by voice?
A very popular detail, but do not believe that I exaggerate?
- Of course we cannot be seen as a panacea, remains to resolve the issue of privacy, since we are not always want others to learn about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in his own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we think about the gestures, but not loose movements, but shorter.
In addition, the gestures were not caught by the camera of the device, but for a bracelet that was the movement of bones and muscles.
For now, it is very large, but in theory can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example of gesture and voice.
- How is that?
- For example, how I would ask you to spend this can of soda?
You will speak and show at the same time.
- Normally I only speak.
- Oh, this is going to be very difficult to recognize.
- Or, you want to force users to adapt to what may or may not do at this moment the machine?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I believe that in the near future we are going to have to work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about his work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints you have of the modern cameras?
Do you lack resolution, depth or something more?
- In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 Megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the issue is not in the cards, but the quality of the matrix and in depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; it gives more work to the designers of algorithms.
In other words, we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also in Z.
It is also important to the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are truly scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable delay of 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the man-machine interaction.
I would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that doesn't require contact for more frames per second.
- And it is not necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- The "Kinect" now has three cameras, one of which is in fact the infrared emitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is in fact a simple pitch visible sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, the number of cameras could solve the problem.
Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, playing with the curvature of location of the cameras and see how this would help determinr the three-dimensional position.
- For what I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented his glasses to the public.
Don't you think that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technology, the glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, all the while holding high a smartphone in your hands, it is not very comfortable, but I think that the best option would be an augmented reality "transmutable" when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could spend the glasses to the smartphone,
The glasses are very personal devices, that is its strength (private things only you can see them), but also its weakness: An augmented reality based on glasses will not work on virtual objects along with other people.
- let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark in the movie "Iron Man," but also for any mere mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: There is no tactile response!
The hands do not feel anything!
What your group prepares answers to this challenge?
- In my lectures often say that augmented reality is the seventh appearance in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth could well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second-hand as a support for the image.
Sign-Up for the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly aimed at providing tangibilidad these "pictures in the air," for example, the interference of several ultrasonic beams aimed at a specific point where the finger feels similar to that one feels if somebody was soplándole at their fingertips, but this feeling is still very weak.
There are also bracelets for the wrist that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
Do you think that he feels that it seems that I should feel at the moment that sees something?
- That is a good idea, we have not yet tried.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space that is going to create an open space, almost without end. We are also working on the idea of the treadmills (not like gyms), mobile platforms, as well as the giant balloons.
For now, the brain is not so easy, we still have to work for many years.
That is what makes it attractive to work with virtual reality for researchers, that many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste rather than culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "avant-garde of St Petersburg," dedicated to people who are in front, at the cutting edge of art and culture.
In this list are the best and the brightest stars of the art scene of St Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city: Often find recognition in Europe without Russia even know.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
The entire city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, which can be found close to the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion meetings and inaugurations.
The paintings of Kirill Miller always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those young purely sociofilósofos St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the avant-garde of Saint Petersburg in the late 1980s to the early 1990s.
In addition, he is a man, whose appearance in the streets of the city's inhabitants awake in smiles and lifts all the mood.
Recently, he took in his hands a organillo and became the recording of Saint Petersburg, as it has matured to do so difficult role, for his bohemian existence, its philosophy and its image.
 - Kirill, why are you going through the city dressed in red and yellow or turquoise, for example?
- Choose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I devote myself to the appearance and image.
In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little gray raises aggression and agitation of properties nothing good.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions are an invitation to debate.
 - When comprendiste destinations be an artist?
 - In an exhibition of the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my work is displayed.
I realized that this was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free, like me, were still incomprendidos.
I became a friend of artists of the new wave, with the subsequent to those faced in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10," and it is over the new wave.
I Sunni minorities in the theater by the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
 - And all this stuck in your art Clinic... - For me it was important to be in the cultural centre of Saint Petersburg, where they were supposed to gather the best creative minds.
In 1995, I became a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there was no reform, there was a musical art club, a bohemian club, the home of the bohemian Saint Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I recall the way that Schnur brought the project to "The Van Gogh's ear."
Schnur and his friends sang songs light under phonogram, wearing tight pants, among them was the currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began playing live, became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg was animator of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them to Trachtenberg and was the beginning of his great career; the basic education and training he received from us.
Gallery "D 137," the "Griboedov's Club, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and regulars.
I am a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was done in the press, the prize was "The people of our city."
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was elected I, thus ended my culmination.
In these new times is not convenient to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and the culture of the last century.
In our times, it is easy to be popular, but the culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
 - There is something recognizable in your work.
 - Many of my paintings are hits, they are clearly present and the occurrence.
I am going to make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in clowns."
The clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now it is painful and frightening.
But in the clowns are all embadurna and the tragedy is removed.
I love the grotesque, I grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a compulsory totalitarian and change of clothes.
Now you are on the clothes, driven abroad, but not in the interior of the person.
And, perhaps that person should not be or give a hand, but spit on him in the face.
And deception will be removed when you change clothes.
 - A little you saw in the role of urban recording. - A cultured city must have a hero as well.
Who better than I to be!
 - Well, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
 - Now the commercial art must be careful, sweet, having tact.
We are witnessing the disintegration of the cultures.
Before people are grouped together in herds, the bohemians wanted one thing, the other simplones.
Now all have been divided into microcomunidades, it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not a ticket of one hundred dollars to wish them all.
Now we have to think about who you want to taste.
Now, every cult hero has its 100 fans.
 - And to listen to STAS Mikhailov arrive by thousands!
 - going to see the left, there is the sex-social sphere.
And a cultural event is 300 people, 10 thousand will never; as a result, less management, less money, everything is fading.
I have to my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not spoil what you have achieved.
When I was young was such a collector had the paintings hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually ends.
Now often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of culture of yesterday, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money just to paint pictures.
I am in favour of this culture.
 - Kirill, what is it that is missing in St Petersburg?
 - Buenos experts in culture.
There is a concept: Official of the culture.
But not all of them can engage in the culture.
When the kings were the correct all was in another way, kings may not understood very well the culture, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the correct experts.
In Moscow, there are now very good consultants.
We have people in Saint Petersburg that could well be experts, but are closed, because experts are needed at a higher level to evaluate them properly and open way.
It is now thriving the subjective personal taste.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they say honestly that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
 - What is for you Saint Petersburg?
 - Saint Petersburg is not a cultural capital in Moscow, there is a lot more culture, there are ground.
But on our stones that art is difficult to grow.
We need cultural terrain and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe, there are a lot of people with curiosity that is going to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We need to make art is out of fashion, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be carried out with a grant of Saint Petersburg.
Giving birth in the space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or an asteroid collision with a killer.
Caravans of spacecraft with humans aboard leave in search of a planet parts.
In order to preserve mankind becomes the main question: How to continue the species in weightlessness or on the same planet parts?
I think that there is little choice.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the head of the State Astronomical Institute researcher, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Began to address the problems of reproduction in space with the flora.
Half a century ago that were carried out experiments with plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit but not in any of the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in orbit, small fruit flies, the drosófilas.
In 1979, were sent into space quail eggs to see how the embryo develops in weightlessness.
As a result we get a normal chick.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, must stand on its own feet and start to move," explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
By failing to find support, chicks were randomly Acer.
And after 10 hours in newborns was a total atrophy of the instincts.
The chicks not reacted to light and sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days simply died.
"And we got twice born chicks, but then we stopped because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev on failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last time a "biological" miniarca flew to the orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments.
However, in the "Bion" biosatélite only will travel species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space with fetuses.
In principle, it is not found nothing supernatural.
"This was precisely the biosatélites, but this was a unique experiment, and such studies should be carried out," said Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, it has not yet managed to deal with the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It is a difficult challenge.
Animals, to lose their usual habitat, simply cannot carry out their sexual instinct.
The man, however, unlike the small animals, in principle, it can.
Homo sapiens has the abstract reasoning and is capable of creating an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women travel into space for 50 years ago.
The greatest risk is spent Tereshkova.
And what is most precious to humanity is the female body.
Our flying gull, and no one on Earth could say: If you are after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has responded to this question," says the veteran aerospace Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only a year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the girl, Andrian Nicolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit, and even worked in the open space, had a child.
However, the risk persists.
There are few, are numbered astronauts who after long flights have all turned out well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," summarizes the pilot cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new avenues in biotechnology, radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The Center's hidrolaboratorio preparation of cosmonauts is an essential stage in the preparation for the flight.
Under conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their skills to work in space.
The water simulates the weightlessness.
If an adult in the water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child is their native element.
The small amphibian-men seem to confirm that life on earth emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier to get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth until the time of the first bath spend only 2 weeks.
"This is very little to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, monitor swimming newborns.
In short, if the weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women is necessary the gravitation, the force of gravity.
In the weightlessness abdominal muscles and pelvic decrepitan is very fast, the ability of expulsion of the fetus is reduced.
Well, we drop it, relying on the action of stimulants for childbirth.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, it pulls.
"And then what?," Valeri Polyakov is this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sense of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton and the muscular system.
A newborn in orbit she is impossible with a special suit for training, as well as adults.
Simply he is without what is vital for him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, to allow the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to back to Earth to a disabled person, a person completely from afar," provides for the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of biomedical problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, over time, this will be a reality, when human beings in their ships come to a distant planet that will be the home for their children born in space.
Chief NKÚ: The inspection of the system "švarc" has not given the guilty politician
In the field of public contracts, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application limp.
So says Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," thus describes the current situation.
The controls sets of Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, says Petr Nečas's attitude towards the system be autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
 The prime minister said recently that the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) would not harass entrepreneurs with inspectors, so it is forbidden or permitted?
"The law should be regulated in some way and if something forbidden, in this case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office that has the obligation to carry out such checks or demand obligations," finds Kala.
At the meeting of the committee of control in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the common project between the German and Czech team, within the framework of which compared the legislation concerning the public contracts in both countries.
What exactly is?
It is a parallel control that we began to make some two years ago.
To put it simplified: European legislation regulates how they should organize the public contracts, this is followed by the current legislation in each country and, later, the practice itself.
We have united all and, although the control has not yet finished, we have obtained very interesting differences, the legislation of our country is "stricter and more complete," however, the actual practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It confirms that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but it is necessary to concentrate on the implementation of the law itself.
What can contribute to this project? What do you think are the conclusions?
It is a common control of this kind could contribute to that we stop investing efforts in the realization of the laws, the reduction and the improvement of the limits, though this does not have a very positive impact.
The economy of saving means to achieve an appropriate thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) in order to avoid the enrichment and, in the long run, the criminal actions.
But not for the sake of reducing the limit of the awards mean that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "red tape" that those who want to find flaws in the system will be able to do it more easily than if the limits remain as high as they are now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the prácticaa of public contracts.
How does the system of checks in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKÚ or is organized differently?
How to the offices, such as the NKÚ, there is the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), an organization similar to ours, with a school as well, the only thing is that in his case is structured in a way that is somewhat different, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The powers are also to some extent analógas, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of accounts are even at this level. Here differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control the federal money, what we call here state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
With regard to local laws, is simpler than ours?
Generally, I would not want to establish a comparison without concrete data, however, Germany remains a model in some respects, but you cannot specify exactly what is best.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
That certainly not, but, I repeat, I do not like to do this kind of comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must cope with a large number of problems.
If it were not so, there would be no benefit to collaborate with our office, do you not think?
With regard to the laws of our country, what it meant for his Office the amendment of the law on public contracts? Somehow manifested its incidence?
Bearing in mind that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, has not yet been manifested in the actions of control.
Given that we make ex post controls, it is necessary to have a certain delay.
For now, there is in the process of preparing for the future: We have launched a new tool to detect "non-economic risks," by which we spend almost 14,000 public contracts, which have been analysed, the changes will be fully reflected here, as they are modified the limits, are the conditions of some types of the selection process and similar.
Do you think that the adoption of this law is beneficial or, rather, it is a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I believe that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that is the case.
The problem that can arise is that the regulation "harden" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
As with the previous regulations, controlled people were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional council), and every law is not respected in the field of public contracts meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to tighten the law in this way?
I do not think in this way.
The system should exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of him and not to punish those who commit a formal ruling, which has no impact on the decision-making process.
Such a system will only create a greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how it comes out of this?
We'll see where this road leads us.
The prime minister has recently declared that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with the so-called švarc system controls, with reference to the fact of being autonomous only on paper, what does that mean?
Does the system švarc "is prohibited or permitted?
The law should be regulated in some way, and if something is prohibited, then even the prime minister of the government can prevent the performance of the Office, which has an obligation to carry out such checks and demand obligations.
You can say: "We change the law and allow it," but you cannot say that we will do as if nothing had happened.
The law on public contracts, the regulations are very strict in terms of the way in which we must act formally, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that exclude the candidate with the best offer for failing to comply with the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be correct, that is, in my opinion, what we are missing.
The roads are ice, although mostly impassable
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads with ice and snow.
Although most of the tracks impassable, some caution must be increased.
Karlovy Vary region
This morning the roads in the region of Karlovy Vary were passable, but showed plates of ice and snow.
The temperature drops and between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day will rise slightly thermometers.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the lower areas, the snow cover is thin.
In contrast, in the crests of the Montes halide snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places the visibility was still poor because of fog, according to the information from the operations control center of the roads in the region.
The fast-track R6 and first-class highway in the region are now passable without restrictions.
However, it is recommended to exercise caution, especially in some bridges whose surface can be icy and slippery.
In addition, they are also guaranteed all avenues of second and third category, including mountain roads.
However, in some of them there are still sections with remnants of ice and snow packed.
It is necessary to increase the attention on the road, especially in the higher areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové region
Some roads in eastern Bohemia there is danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains may have formed a layer of snow on the tracks, reported in its pages the Directorate of roads and highways.
Road workers warn drivers about the danger to form ice sheets, especially in higher areas of the region of Pardubice.
Frost may occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on the roads of second and third category.
Roads R and R / 43 / 34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow on the roads of the Krkonoše mountains to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of packed snow in the highest parts of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of the eastern Bohemia, the sky will be clear between today and partially cloudy, without precipitation.
Temperatures typically range between three below zero and a positive grade, which a weak wind.
Of Pilsen region
The roads in the region of Pilsen impassable this morning, although caution should be increased and it will be necessary to adapt to the weather.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frost, temperatures will range between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some routes could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will find themselves in fog, but the visibility will improve gradually.
This is what emerges from the reports of the operations control center of roads in the region.
The highway D5 is passable almost without restrictions, although it is recommended to exercise caution, particularly on the road between 80 km and 131.
The surface of the majority of first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of Plzeň and Tachov bordering Germany may have sections with ice sheets.
The second and third category are damp, so that, in this case, also warns of sections with ice.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially in the less traveled routes in the Šumava area.
Of Olomouc region
Drivers who come to higher areas of the region of Olomouc will be partially discarded with snow.
After the chemical treatment, snow was still in the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský Kříž.
Road workers took off the snow during the night; on the road from Šumper was piled up about three inches of snow, according to the administrators of the tracks.
In the rest of the region, most roads impassable without restrictions.
"In the highest parts of the Šumper road, remnants of snow.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will find snow means discarded in the direction of Jeseník, "confirmed today an operator of the administration of roads to Šumper ČTK.
On the ground, and at night went to the Jesenická also his colleagues and, after the chemical treatment, the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the road from Olomouc roads impassable without restrictions, Šternberská drivers should drive with caution in the forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
Region of Ústí nad Labem region and Liberec
The operators of the roads in northern Bohemia have reported complications in various sections in the early hours of the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snow or ice cream, according to the database of the police, the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures are below zero, even in the lower areas, so that the ice and snow, of course, remain on the road, in the lower areas, especially in the south-east of the Massif Central Czech, there are no problems and the roads, generally, are dry.
The mmento complications have not been registered service.
Road operators have been alerted to the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal during the night and during the day is expected rain and snow that melts and in the evening the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Since the general roads have been announced unfavourable conditions on the road I / 13, on the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had been arched over the road with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in less than a month is going to be the end of the world, what do you think about this?
It is only one among many other alarmist news that we like agarrarnos.
The music group The Tap Tap we like rather make jokes about this, and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December a truly original project organizáis: Three concerts at the end of the world.
Can you explain this to our readers?
It is a state-run charity event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that is the end of the Mayan calendar for statement on 21 December at 11: 10 am.
The previous day, on 20 December at 21 hours, we will organise 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
Will end up at approximately the same time that the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, after all we were building the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to trying to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with the society, about the state of the world we will leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: Boots, T-shirts, bags and original key rings at the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the anthem at the end of the world, entitled "End of the world, cancelled."
Currently it is very popular on YouTube, can be heard in the benefits?
Of course we do, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and there is no end of the world...
The performers sing all at the same time in all three concerts.
The hymns they want to each other simultaneously, thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration?
We work together with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charitable events and concerts.
We put all our efforts to participate in this project.
It has been shown that the majority of them are interested in and amused them to work with us.
What will the money raised in the concerts at the end of the world?
Equipment for the school without barriers Studeo, which we perform in its sixth consecutive year with the civil partnership Tap in Jedličkův ústav.
The students of the school of Jedličkův ústav regularly receive visits from teachers with fun and interesting activities.
The students do not have sufficient financial resources to pay teachers and do a efuerzo to make this possible.
In the context of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building which we will move with this project.
In each concert act several groups and performers.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will act Chinaski, Support lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, you can consult www.kpks.cz.
Do you have scheduled another "spectacular" similar action in the future?
In May, we will act for the first time in the festival Pražské bird, so here surely we will prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and me, personally, taking advantage of that we are in the United States, I would like to be complemented by actions in Washington and in Chicago.
Your overseas plans are not exactly minimalist, until now have done for example in Madrid, Brussels, London, or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It is not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in an electric wheelchair, chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and in addition we carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments.
However, until now we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were well prepared, which never ceases to amaze me.
Even in Moscow, where we have returned recently, went very smoothly.
Thanks to the exits abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What you have found so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia, we have seen that in the east, there is still a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still not common for a single person moves through the center of the city in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, give preference to someone in a wheelchair in the lift, there is not.
Fortunately, it has created a civil association that strives to focus attention on the problems of people with disabilities.
In what ways we should follow the example of more advanced countries?
There are many ways in which we are behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and the improvement of the situation always depends on the people it affects directly.
In London and Madrid is very normal for people with a severe disability moves on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, where you go.
But it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities to participate in social life actively, in this respect, with The Tap Tap just go a little bit ahead!
A society respectful or without barriers is one thing, but when it comes to the emergence of eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, will begin to change everything.
So far, there are isolated cases of people who have a great force of will.
The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we look at a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedličkův ústav, where he had a lot of young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, we were a little hands (laughs).
However, the popularity did not arrive until the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that helped us a lot to connect with famous singers and also work actively to promote the group.
We came to the conclusion that the work that is not seen, it is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the support of the European Union, we can afford more quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Do you had intended to go as far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that he had, that something can be done differently.
The entertainment world is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, everything new is viewed with caution and takes a long time to be accepted.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly the compassion, is a natural reaction.
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings that suffer and that we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, on condition, of course, that has the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for them to people with disabilities, then, is not only a step forward for them, but for society as a whole.
How Assisted the fact that you are a demanding boss, as he describes a lot of people?
If we want to do a quality job, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and require some discipline.
I think that it is completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with their heads in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandons them.
But that is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, the group The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of the year 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people come in and go out, cannot be avoided.
Anyone who has the will and desire will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday at 9pm 20.12.2012
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, Brno Fléda and Plynojem in Ostrava and 12 groups and other musicians will participate in the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected by the end of the evening via video conference to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the resources needed to finance the school multifunctional equipment without barriers in Prague STUDEO Jedličkův ústav, costing 25 million korunas.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry into the option of advance sales at Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers from the countries of the European Space Agency held last week in Poland was accepted as the 12th member of ESA is the second ESA member country of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the subsequent years he participated in the commission of the agency projects.
However, the path of Poland towards the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts are already engaged in flights into space before World War II, though not always understood his work.
I remember, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld in the astronomical observatory in Warsaw where, on 6 December 1933, presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to cosmonautics."
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr Jan Gadomski was the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In the year 1934 Šternfeld won the prize in France Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his "Introduction to cosmonautics."
The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later turned into a major driver of astronomy and cosmonautics.
Published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known throughout the world and its contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name to one of the craters on the hidden face of the moon.
In the year 1925 was built in Poland a dresina that was going to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and was not familiar with details of the project.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used to boot the dresina or for braking.
Information on this dresina is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From the year 1933 the Polish artillery began to devote themselves to the missiles.
The research was funded by the Komórka techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with the prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
On the basis of the material preserved, it becomes clear that the investigation came to the stadium of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, was interrupted the investigation.
In 1937 appeared in the press the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by the engineer Rohoziński and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza," the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of the engines for missiles.
Shortly before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all projects of missile technology for military use and coordinate all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, was interrupted by the start of the war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautics Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 edition of the journal Problemy referred for the first time to society with four very extensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, the prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be devoted to cosmonautics.
At that time, had already been launched projects of artificial satellites and it was obvious that the cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects.
Since the beginning of 1956 Polish Astronautics Society (PTA) aspired to become part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of the same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice-president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM sounding rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket that carried out scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first released on 10 October 1958.
The rocket had a height of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach the 5 kg of weight.
Later, he completed the version RM-1A and in the summer of 1959 began flight tests of the RM-2 rockets in two stages in the desert of Błędów.
The rocket measured 1.4 metres and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket was supposed to be the object of scientific study. The rocket RM-34 would have a height of 14,5 km and its mission would be to control the wind.
However, the work was suspended in 1962.
The successor of the first rockets of the type RM was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Developed three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which were different from each other by the available space for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket in the space available for the volume was 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum height in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 was developed in the Air Institute the Meteor-2 rocket, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km altitude.
Version was later built the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland in the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
In the framework of the programme Interkosmos, Poland joined the investigation into the cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the law social traabajos.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
Of course, it will be interesting to examine the existing problems from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, just as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
As a result, this means that the various forms of economic and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with rampant financial speculation.
The effect of the large differences in the cost of labour (wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, is trying to shorten distances and this leads to a "bajadda" of the price of the competitor with the aim of taking over the bulk of the market and thus increase their profit margin.
On a large scale means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buy cheaper there or disappear. The result is a high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour, compared with other economies, is higher.
Because private capital does not have any social responsibility and, with it, nor is it responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, grows necessarily social spending in the state.
This whole situation leads to the total disinterest of employers to pay taxes and to compensate for the economic and social damage that they have caused in their pursuit of profit.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data.
Less than honest practices of private capital creates situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the aim of reducing artificially the social level of the population and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
Put another way, governments put private capital available to its own population without taking into account the social decline.
This is particularly evident in the changes to the existing laws.
The aim is to force the people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially when it comes to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of financial liability in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees in terms of labor rights.
The result is a growing poverty along with the widening of the gap between rich and poor.
For a number of years, in Germany, there are points of delivery of food for poor people who cannot stay with their own work.
The number of people who receive this type of aid arrives at a million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly common case: People employed with a wage so low that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
It was such a public scandal related to the situation of the German federal parliament's auxiliary employees.
The saving measures of virtually all of the southern states of the EU are, without a doubt, the same situation: People, under pressure from an abysmal decline of their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century or malvivir with a very bad salary on the edge of society, in the hope that one day the country private investor capital.
Is it necessary preguntrarse where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never comes, as Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny portion of a European salary.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim ad nauseam that the state should not provide capital to the economy, to manage the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital has no effect on your selfishness in the political progress and, consequently, throughout the state.
In this case, the answer is clearly yes.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the area of corruption, in the mutual favours, in legislation that is virtually reprehensible everywhere but it is not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is this: The state ministries, in the absence of financial resources, are drafting bills to private law firms, which are often associated with the industry.
Such bills are approved later in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, not all power emanates from the people, as was announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation that's how Appiános describes in his book The crisis of the Roman republic in times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state has long disintegrating and administrations are occupied by force."
In exchange for bribes, favours obtained illegitimately and help to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread unhindered and the people went to the polls to vote apalabrado beforehand... "" had not people with character showed it to aspire to a post in the administration, so once, as a result of this disruption, the state was eight months without consuls... "" He commenced to talk seriously that the only remedy for a situation so serious was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man... "Although Appiános thought in Pompeii, Caesar rose to power and democracy transformed forever in autocracy.
The conclusion, in the same way as in antiquity, is that today's society is based on inconsiderate preferences of individual benefit without taking into account the common interests.
Private capital is not capable, in its essence, to understand and claim the benefit of the whole society.
The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of communist and fascist regimes must be sought, therefore, in the unbridled liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a kind of liberal democracy, as a definite pause, waiting for the next blow.
The truly devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in the ancient history and the most recent one.
The suspension of the law on public contracts is not the solution, at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is, therefore, systemic.
The solution is to concrete socio-political reforms, which will strengthen both the involvement of the state capital and the influence of citizens in government and to weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The laboratory of the chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could" (There is no violence, and nothing could do it), Sting in his song Fragile and whose chorus reads "Let's do not forget how fragile we are" (let us not forget how fragile we are).
"If my sons did not want wars, there would be no" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the recent waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, have emerged, as always, mixed reactions.
One, on the side of Israel, argues in favour of the right of self-defense and cast in the role of the Palestinian terrorists; the other supports the Palestinians and alleged racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Arabs and Palestinians accused Israel of state terrorism.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the killings that are repeated regularly and who is the victim; after all, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and not lived the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to find out who benefits from the tensions that creep for 95 years (calculated on the basis of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others in the conclusions I have reached on the basis of my own understanding of the issue, about who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity the history of the struggles for power is in the front row.
Each time we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is not so clear is whether these characters were always those who directed their steps autonomously or if behind his throne had someone who directed their actions toward a particular goal.
We have to accept that we live in an era that the world's wealth concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and power that this implies, has not been able to get in a single generation.
Among these is an astronomically rich families that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I do not know, but do not exclude): The Rothschild.
It is not much to write about them.
Of course.
In the 90s of the 19th century bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating his name with criminal acts of great severity, power and wealth, or both, they were covering the shoulders, which to them always meant a strengthening.
They have significant holdings in almost all the world's central banks, and in those countries that are not represented, has been declared or is preparing a war: Before the attack on Afghanistan were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq was 5, after overthrowing Gaddafi were only four, but in the meantime, Russia has imposed the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank, Bank of America of the Rothschild, began during the War of Secession to print money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK started to print money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the Fed for having triggered the great economic crisis of the year 1929.
His quest for global power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to develop a plan with three world wars, designed by Mason Albert Pike, awarded the degree 33.
The first war espoused to eliminate the big states royalists throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially in Britain, and the third is intended to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and one billion people (such a number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and not will consume fewer resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution) and the final adoption of the absolute powers.
The method with which operates the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschild, follows the dynamics of the outbreak of crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order out of chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always entail a worsening of the situation; if not, it is enough to remember that the Fed was created to prevent a repeat of a crisis like that of 1907.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, and after that, as a result, the onset of the First World War, destroyed the Tsarist Russia with the start of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended so sudden and unjustified from an economic and military point of view, the capitulation of Germany (wars in order to put an end to the Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire.
In order to prepare the ground for the Second World War, allowed bankers and politicians to create, so covert, a conflict arises in the wake of the huge war reparations imposed on Germany, thereby creating the conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, was enough to serve them with the Germans the solution of the Führer, who was strong enough and simple and pointed to guilty, and build a Czechoslovakia after composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that was supposed to represent and represented so well the role of the fifth column, which ignited the flame and led to the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild drove the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The outbreak of the Second World War: It is difficult to know if Hitler threw too much of the rope that had him tied international bankers initially or if all he did was part of a plan; however, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the global society.
Israel was founded in 1948 and, similarly to the way in which war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for the Second World War, with the proclamation of the state of Israel was established the focus for a third war.
If international bankers managed to start, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim in the front line of combat, now with the Arab population and, generally, Muslims in the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only in the context of their country, but also internationally. Let us take as an example how to divide so starkly supporters and detractors of Israel.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Where injustice begets injustice in an endless spiral of violence, whether at the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their quest for global power?
At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the people of Israel and its leaders, because, as it happens in our country, international bankers just presented their candidates in elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is a typical example of fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, given that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict, and if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which passes 20% of the entire global oil (the navigation corridor has only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light are now the words uttered by David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis, and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in his imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population served by a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is a chip implanted at birth that controls his entire being.
"And obliges all, large and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on the right hand or forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they carry the name of this monster or the numbers of his name.
It is necessary to understand this: Whoever has two fingers of forehead, which reduces the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six. "
Argo film: If you put crude oil, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamist students held a demonstration of the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, which after the revolution he fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
The situation for the American administration did not offer any positive perspective: Throwing overboard the Shah could not afford it, because, if it did, undermined the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not available to them.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently intensified further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
Diplomats imprisoned were released 444 days after the intervention of the Algerian government negotiator.
In the US, its fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" of the director and actor Ben Affleck addresses an episode of this story, which harvested a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, escaped six employees of the building.
After a complicated journey, ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by a covert history an extravagant point: Came with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that looked at the location in the country for the filming of a science fiction blockbuster.
Combination of genres
The plan that he drew the expert "exfiltración" Toni Mendez required the cooperation of Hollywood.
In order to make the lie seem truthful, he wrote about the film project in specialized magazines, organized press conferences, the fictitious production company even had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie," the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example might be the Ocean's Eleven series).
In the film combines the moods, on the one hand, are well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits are emblematic photographs of the time of the events, which were set forth in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical scenes of Hollywood somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
In addition, the scenes of the CIA and other institutions: Each men who analyzed the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, on the phone.
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the object of ridicule, has become a respectable director and their ways has ceased to be the targets of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Farewell, Farewell" (2007) and the thriller "The Town and City of thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Affleck film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
In addition, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a feature that put the directors of old films over Hollywood standards.
And Affleck is shown in Argo, where Tehran is "wheel" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film takes place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the events true. The introductory sequence of the taking of the embassy is impressive for its concise ability that, at the same time, transmitted the thrill of confusion and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieved a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the impostor in the bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that a story explained does not offer much in the way of the film's most intriguing scenes.
And it manages quite well. Sometimes it adds something to the reality: Not everything here is so elegant (the scene in which lurks the crisis at the airport in Tehran, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled pursuit after his track become crazy).
The weakness of Argo is the arousing that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Neuwirth and John Goodman has a very funny role as collaborators of Hollywood, although their characters deserved more space and are by no means alone in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of dramatic stroke, but it is a film that you can continue with a moderate interest, assess their performance and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But will collapse, this will be difficult.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof that it can be exaggerated notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services, is sufficient.
Rules for the inflated balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year presents a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce the contest on "the regulation or the most absurd ideas of the workshop of the EU."
"We came up after the last event, the EU plans to adopt a quota of 40 percent of women in management positions in large European companies," explained právo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the recent decision of the European court to unify the insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women aventajaban of better prices in the life insurance because they represent a lower risk objectively.
"Other great ideas from the workshop of the EU may be proposed by the people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of the month of February 2013, "reported Nacher.
Among the EU's controversial regulations is, for example, adding fuel to the compulsory biocomponentes that, as a result, harms the environment; another is to ban the use of mercury thermometers of all life only because they contain a small amount of a hazardous substance or the guideline shadow the size of cages for laying hens, which has contributed to the significant increase in the price of eggs this year.
The ban has been criticized for factual use the expression "spread butter" or the withdrawal of the classic light bulb of the shops.
A banana quality must have a length of 14 inches.
The apparatus of the Union takes this kind of decisions, often under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose petitions in Brussels are usually defended by any state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of a veto, claims the demands of their banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the petition, for example, that higher-quality bananas in the EU should have a length of at least 14 inches and could not present "abnormal bends."
The European Commission defended itself by saying that this only seeks to harmonise national rules do not homogenized so far, which only complicate their marketing.
The rules that make reference to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of food.
The candidate to win the poll might be the prescription of the US last year, according to which the inflatable balloons that are marketed is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 years are not allowed to puffing them up without the supervision of an adult.
The US referred to an American study, according to which, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of infant death by asphyxiation.
It is also in effect a similar restriction applies to the use of matasuegras by children up to 14 years.
Strange occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: Anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia, so as not to offend the sensibilities of Greece, it must speak of FYROM (Former Republic of Macedonia know).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists'aissez 한승연, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the prescription of the Union over the volume of food stocks in the territory of a member state.
The EU found the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU.
Later, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the volume set for canned mushrooms, which posed a threat of substantial fine.
The organizers of the survey also were interested in the occurrence of pay to those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the application of subsidies.
This kind of ideas emerged in Brussels, but not in Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage because they do not have sea.
We ask the European Union compensation, "he said in the autumn of 2004, the then agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
I argued with the fact that in our country there was a lot of grain and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had filled warehouses and had to be exported.
According to Palas, given that the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was ready to help the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant proposal was to receive a grant to municipalities by the ministry for local development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), in particular, is aimed at the drafting of applications for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the member states are often the target of criticism, the efforts of the EU in terms of regulations and, in addition, a more effective operation and development across the Union deserve more, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but the member states have achieved in negotiations on budgets.
The Czechs also strikes a chord, in the same way as other EU countries, the fight for the right to the denomination of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious in these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc curd cheese, but had to change the name of the national rum, whose tradition in our country goes back to the 19th century, and became known as "tuzemák."
Only those products made from distilled from sugar cane can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin in the EU, along with the feta cheese and gorgonzola cheese known all over the world, the German city of Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham, are already for example cookies of Karlovy Vary, the tent of Pohořelice and Třeboň, and even the variety of hops from Žatec.
As maras protected in the EU, can be proud of the gingerbread from Pardubice and Wafers Hořice v Podkrkonoší.
People want to save the republic, but I am a fan, says Okamura
Mr Senator, how he happened to run in the elections for president?
It is not about being a senator or president.
If in our country were so good, then he would not pursue my candidacy.
But I can no longer bear to see how it steals in the last 20 years in our country, how the thieves go unpunished, increasing taxes and the retirement age.
He had no ambitions to be political.
When I see something that I don't like, try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I already have forty years and my candidacy is independent, the only possibility that I have to change things is to stand as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon after it has put on the way to the presidency.
Not is turning its back on those who have voted?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the elections of the Senate.
Precisé out later that if elected to the Senate, would present my candidacy for the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but we drive down to anyone who wants to initiate a change.
This is compounded by the media, which undermine and confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lying.
For me, it is said to have bribed journalists or that I have been an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
We are going to talk about their ideas.
It presents to the presidential struggle with financial theory and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of the property above 20 million.
To this must change the law.
As president does not have this competition, and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a group of pressure to the office of guide was recognized as an autonomous work, and we succeeded.
The problem lies in politics: If someone comes up with a good proposal, whether on the right or left, it rejects on purpose, and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to get the support of all the parliamentary groups.
Without encasillamientos nor dogmas of party, I have the ability to be able to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Is it considered more of a left-wing or right-wing man?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that the people I considered more left-wing.
It does not matter to me, whether it be a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we come out ahead.
I do not care if someone is right-wing or left-wing, I want to bring people together.
Always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from KSČM or ODS and, by the same token, I am against the bad ideas.
A joke when they say to you that it is populist.
But it is not showing with what he says?
When you create a business plan for the company, you have also certain goals and ideals.
And try to get to them.
There will be those who call populism, but all proposals of which I speak already operate in the world or known experts speak of them.
But without the support of the parliament only slogans.
And thus cannot survive in the long-term policy.
Or do you believe that if you are going to the people and talk to them, will, for example, a financial and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my part to achieve it.
If he were elected president, there would be no problem in arranging a broadcast live on TV in which I would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties that lend legitimacy to the financial and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors in the state.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why don't want to.
If there is a strong character that points to disputes, pressure can be done on the political scene.
Take for instance the direct election of the president, who has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I say that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals attempt to seek allies.
I just start in politics and try to obtain the greatest possible support for my program.
I try to take things forward myself, but if they don't get it right, within six years, and I will leave it to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like if Okamura would save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that a person does not do anything, so I have visited a number of well-known personalities, as if maybe they animaran to stand as a candidate for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought to light the fraud with light heating oils.
I introduced myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, I am now in the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls, and those who did, voted for the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are two of the independent sector.
The people chose the Senate, so that it will be difficult to achieve change.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming his own party?
I have not yet seen because I don't have time to do so, to check the past unblemished record of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I have no money for the campaign for the presidency, in my mind, there are only 20,000 kroner transparent.
Don't have money?
Speaking of declarations of ownership, how is yours?
I think my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a plot of land valued at 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another floor appraised in eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of ten million, an Aston Martin about 3,5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth, I've always liked James Bond, who was driving the car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fighting against the evils and injustices.
Do you take an Aston Martin, his property is valued at $60 million and has no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but does not want to put too much money on their side.
It is not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to endeudarme?
In the campaign, I have already put 2.5 million.
The fact that it does not have any sponsor shows that there is not much interest in my program.
And I don't have the obligation to pay for the campaign with money from my pocket.
The costs of the campaign cover in essence what will I receive in salary of senator.
But I could not live in it, for example, would not be able to pay my son English school, which costs 30,000 kroner per month.
If you would like to just make money, then I would not as a candidate.
So will continue with its business activity in order to live?
Wouldn't have said before that he was going to leave this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, in part I have left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in the spring.
People wanted to be the Samaritan that saving the republic.
But I also need to live something.
How much do you earn each month as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I still winning.
If I were president, then would leave the business.
You can see the entire interview in the Saturday edition of práva.
The architectural firm MVRDV, shows that the real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the recently completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos
"I think that the building is fun, has a futuristic look, and finally there is something interesting to see," said Lisette Verhaig, a bystander who goes through the streets.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: "In addition, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have the Internet, tablets and e-books.
No one goes for taste in these libraries passé, isn't it?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town located at the gates of Rotterdam that barely deserves a fleeting visit, holds the dubious honor of having been raised with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this situation as shameful, some years ago, it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear represented in the euro notes in the form of thumbnails of reinforced concrete decorated.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that is how policy makers decided that there was only one possibility to improve the statistics: He had to build a library!
Winy Maas, of the Dutch architectural firm MVRDV, a master in the art of the bar diagrams of buildings and funny and cynical, it took issue with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury looked puzzled around them and encogía shoulders, Maas proceeded to pile the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so-called 'Boekenberg'. "
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros is on the runway.
It is part of the revitalization project, complete with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential buildings and detached.
In early November, the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012."
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012."
In this way, the small town devoid of history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall after whose white facade one intuiría rather a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse has the first public cultural building now in its history.
The long road to the book
The first impression is that this is a paradise of books under a cheese.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right at the centre of the massif, but the true lovers of space and reading does not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of his rise to the top.
The interior is fully glazed light and easy to cover with the view, the brick floor annealing and elegant streetlights unequivocally support the public status of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
When you look up you can get to see the banks of the park, the dogs and children playing football.
All sides and books, books and more books.
"Normally the shelves of books are arranged along the facade and in the center there is a huge dark room that, in general, tends to be somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to put an upside down the classic spatial configuration and remove the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is well taken: In the middle are the offices, the library of the Internet, the chess club, environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserve black shelves that assume the functions of mural coating, parapet and railing at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strangers.
Even the architects and engineers more civilians per day shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And that is how one day, on a farm Friesland, we are met with the appropriate by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands used a plastic fabric of few millimetres thick as a base to hold the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This tissue lasts for two seasons and then discarded.
This is for the library prensó fabric, for the first time in such quantities, to get plates of four centimeters thick.
With the heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark material, homogeneous and resistant that smells like a mixture of new car and sports shoe.
After 105 steps to the top of the mountain.
At the end of this route continues nearly 500 meters around the mountain reward awaits us: From the cafeteria not only has a fantastic view of the city, but it can also be a tasty Dutch croquettes and ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere as well as maintain the atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Although deduce given its large glass surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
The heating and cooling needed are obtained from geothermal energy.
Despite the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun shines for only a few hours inside.
The huge wooden cerchas located in transversal sense to the glass facade serve to provide shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable interior climate.
The rest is a thing of the automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical worker in the Information Technology, has dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Similarly, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library, she describes the "Boekenberg" as the "soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, he invited all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book from his private collection.
In this way it aims to fill, for the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have a complete file; currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has appreciated.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says the architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain bond with this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
Although it is only there to embellish.
In this way, the study MVRDV has achieved a great success in that discipline reigns in the specialized slang is known as "creating an identity."
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated that may be.
Finally, a starting point for shaping its identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a leading role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US relations. UU.-Europa, this puts Berlin in a very difficult diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany hinted that he would vote against the proposal to grant to the Palestinian territories the status of an observer state of the United Nations.
However, finally Berlin abstained.
Why? "
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I believe that it supports the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising that took place in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when the issue was to establish a no-fly zone.
Finally this has been declared by NATO.
Do you find it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance on major international issues are at stake?
Yes, it is.
This is due to the fact that at the moment is shifting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and by focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more is that Europeans do not have a coherent policy and uniform.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to do so.
I think we are still exploring what their role, but they have already begun the path towards a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Great Britain.
What does it mean specifically a "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, stands ready to defend positions different from those of the United States and its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is a strong motivation in the economic policy, that is to say, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are somewhat different from those of other major powers and that is why Germany must protect their interests.
Are these economic interests have influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and in the vote of the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, you must be careful and not alienating Arab public opinion nor of Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I don't give so much importance because it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, it does play a key role in German considerations.
Germany has undermined its relationship with the US to abstain from voting on important decisions such as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys a huge level of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been a rupture as drastic as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps with that Germany has managed to gain a certain respect.
In the end, all this has done nothing but prove that it is a country that taken seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
In contrast, the US has been clearly in favour of a veto.
Is there disparity of views between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed due to US domestic politics.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly a great understanding towards the European position.
But, because of the political situation that we live here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public.
I believe that the real disparity of views is not actually the scale that is attributed to him.
If we look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all happy with the policy that develops.
Do you find it difficult to reconcile the Germany that maintains close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its major partners in the EU, on the other?
I believe that it is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent European policy and homogeneous, but that is not the case.
Therefore, do not have the opportunity to be part of a larger entity, but should push things from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will assume a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European stance.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship he has with Israel.
This has always been a difficult issue.
But I think that the Germans have made clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany sees itself in the role of major international actor? Do you want to actually Germany to assume a leading role?
Or perhaps he still finding it difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet been used, it is always a little uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to play a more important role.
If you look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time that Germany is positioned as the main actor, it will unleash certain antialemanes feelings.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and it is that no one wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries.
Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics increasingly decreases, but the EU does not cover the gap for the time being, who is then?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a leading role.
Even if they don't like, if they find it unpleasant or if they become a people even more unpopular, c'est la vie!

"Trademark protection" in China: When Puma and Armani are suddenly in Chinese brands
Armani is a brand known worldwide and Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is Armani Polo?
Following this name hides a designation officially registered in China, but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, this is not protection while the real epónimos submit a claim.
And even then, it is not clear that they are going to give the reason.
"Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer with the law firm Taylor Wessing specialising in protection of rights violations in the Far East.
Every week arrives at my table a new case.
The imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to register their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-instead of Gucci and Prada, Prada-Kny.
German companies also copied legally in the same way, as has happened to the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens an archive which holds seats in the trademark office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name which is also served the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in this copy and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are several floors of department stores dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeit.
However, the cases are other Pattloch. On behalf of their clients, he fight against the fact that the trademark office officially granted to Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered in another place.
What the Chinese call "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese word "Bang Dakuan,"
That refers to women who have "fish" to a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It is bad for the business, we have to fight against it," requires Pattloch.
"The brand is taking on water, the monopoly position disappears and the damage suffered by the image is enormous."
The financial losses and the costs of the sectors affected are millionaires, especially in the case of emblematic of luxury products.
According to data from the market analysis firm CLSA, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year, China is in size, the third luxury goods market, which is growing faster.
However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and involves a lot of money.
The processes can extend up to nine years, and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because so much time had passed that the name of demand had already been turned into a "market reality."
"If the plaintiff has bad luck, maybe even have to pay money to the plagiador because the process has damaged the brand in China," says Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the construction machinery maker SANY, the company that has been taken over recently by the German manufacturer Putzmeister concrete pumps.
That is why today the Chinese can continue to use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
The buyer of Volvo, Geely, initially used a blue-and-white logo that he remembered largely to BMW; the matter was determined in the courts and Geely had to modify it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer in China lost against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose logo was a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The trademark office in Beijing CTMO recognizes that in 2010 have had difficulties due to a shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the emergency work returned to normal."
In this way, the number of processes without complaint process has been reduced by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 of those cases were resolved resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 complaints are still pending.
It costs a lot of money to fight
As is usual in China, the numbers are startling.
Last year the CTMO recorded more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China is heading for the tenth consecutive year the list of new registrations around the world, according to the trademark office.
It seems that this also applies to the number of valid logos, a figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011 would have pocketed 1,800 billion yuan in the concept of rights.
Put another way, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fight that costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group fight in the courts against a Chinese copycat.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of car parts of imitation,
The copier has managed to secure the rights of Chinese on the brand Freudenberg.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany surnames are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and Chief Executive Officer of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The trademark office CTMO also dismissed the appeal of the muniqueses.
In the following two instances have given reason to Freudenberg, but the other side is still fighting today.
We have to be very careful
Now the case has come to the gates of the High Court of Justice, which is still pending.
Wentzler hopes to resolve the issue favorably and commends the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the company has had to review files of up to one hundred years old to be able to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered to the opposing party a "six-figure sum in euros," with the aim of reaching an amicable settlement, but did not succeed.
"This shows how much we care about," said Wentzler.
The dangers that lurk in the Far East even threaten to affect Europe,
Specifically, if there are copycats secured the rights to trademarks are not protected.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany tried to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long abandoned this area, but he managed to prevent the registration.
"We have to be very careful," said Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch recommend to German companies to be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on trademark rights, but what we have to do is register in China, "anything that may be subject to protection," as Wentzler points.
Otherwise, the issue may be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, in the event that Freudenberg lost the last round of their particular battle, then it would have to pay the opposing party licence fees for its own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question expulsarían us of the market.
World day of the fight against AIDS: Dance, sing, help
In Heidelberg tested the chorus Imbongi and exult in Swaziland AIDS orphans
The story of a bond capable of overcoming much more than 8.733 miles away.
It starts with the first dance: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, high-heeled shoes and mocasines seek compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then begin to rise slowly, the voices of the singers (alto, bass, tenor and soprano), arremolinándose, entorpeciéndose and siguiéndose each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the director of 29 years, is threatening to pull out of their boxes almost in trying to bring order to his energetic and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg the chorus Imbongi is trying a new song.
They have also reached the 50 singers, aged between 23 and 69 years, since the human geneticist until the master of the house.
"Om 'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a foreign language barely known: The Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
For the self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations program for the fight against AIDS, globally, there are approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 in Swaziland AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV positive.
The association Voices for Africa has found in Germany godparents to 180 AIDS orphans in the village of eSitjeni.
Seventy of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover the tuition of the school, the uniform and I will ensure a hot meal per day in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "narrator of stories" or "panegirista."
No one in this room knows to speak fluent this Bantu language, but they know how to sing.
Ten years ago this chorus rehearsal songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to carry them to their place of origin: Southern Africa.
To 8.733 miles away as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the north-east of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called eSitjeni that depends on the voices of the choir.
The forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple huts of mud and straw, a large proportion of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
ESitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: The rate of AIDS infection of the highest and lowest life expectancy around the world, according to UNICEF.
The population does not wisher circumcision, a practice that has been shown to reduce by half the risk of contagion.
More than 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and die with something more than thirty years has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this hidden population, but what they saw mostly were many children in the streets that were not only for the protection of their parents, but the main thing: Food, clothing and education.
Without a title, the possibilities in a poor country are slim.
Initially it was only the particular commitment of a few which made it possible for a child outside the school and enjoyed a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year after the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa," which has since been occupied professionally for orphans of AIDS in eSitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial origin of STDs are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
STDs are the most common source of the AIDS virus, the human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
The ladillas and scabies are among STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur more frequently in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute on the basis that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in a sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, tricomonas, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among the young, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European polls, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged between 15 and 25 years.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has evolved the number of infections?
Not all the sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled its number of cases in 2001 to 1,697 3.698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections continues a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This is one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause sores in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or other symptoms cause and therefore not be detected.
How can you protect?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100 percent protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt and infections by physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend to undergo regular medical examinations, especially if they are frequent changes of sexual partner.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured, and it is possible to avoid any late consequence.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the chorus for their performances throughout Germany, come to raise enough money.
"We have sent a total of about 200,000 euros in eSitjeni already," says proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In his own people Zodwa Dlamini, a woman self-confident and with leadership manages the money sent from Germany.
That takes care of orphans to find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as referred to older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their charge, offer them a roof to live and take care of children go to school every day on time and in uniform.
Those who do not have anyone left under the protection of Khanyisile, an unmarried woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a sewing school, has built two barns and, in collaboration with the American health organization PSI, has made many of the town's residents have been subjected to an HIV test.
This is not something obvious, because, although it is clear that this disease across the country, they do not usually speak openly about it.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king has officially 14 wives.
The Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle and full of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This way of life is not officially accepted is largely responsible for the spread so fast that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades.
But it is also due to the many seasonal workers who travel the country from one side to the other, and that they take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are hardly used.
It is a different culture, here only accept the skin against skin contact. "
To promote cultural exchange, Imbongi choir travels every two or three years in southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still reminiscent of the apartheid era.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in a language of blacks; both recognition not only brings with it a great atmosphere and a lot of joy, but has also managed to drag a couple of tears to some rabid border soldier.
The journey takes them to always eSitjeni, where singers visit children sponsored.
Despite the fact that this small population barely appears on maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is well known.
"Come to eSitjeni, there shines the light," says the people of the place.
And after touring the 8.733 miles as the crow flies back to Heidelberg until the rehearsal rooms of the Bergheimer street full of singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Probably the ice cap has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the US space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the planet closest to the sun, there are also cooled water, as can be seen from three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science."
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow has formed a layer of ice.
It seems that it has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 metres thick.
The water comes presumably of comets or, in all likelihood of asteroids that smashed against Mercury.
No one relates the discovery of ice with the possibility of life on the planet, said the chief investigator of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how they have reached the water and other components of life to other parts of the solar system.
Completely unnoticed for the inhabitants of the planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots as the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time send images to Earth: Small windows to the immensity of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets in our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006, Ceres is not a "planet."
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which appear endless generations of stars: The oldest stars are shown as blue points, although it is more difficult to recognize the pink color of the stars "babies."
This region of star formation, called a little romantic by scientists W5, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This image of a star tornasolada extinction was taken by the NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The ring-shaped is composed of the material that the star spits in its process of extinction.
In the huge Misty Trífida, 5,400 light years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
The NASA Spitzer telescope took this picture of the area of galactic star formation.
The Pléyades, a group of stars also known by the nickname "The Seven Sisters," are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope can better appreciate the colors.
The Misty the Axial appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located at 700 light years in the constellation of Aquarius.
Its similarity with a terrestrial continent has earned him the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular colour.
This fledgling star could be captured in all its glory for the first time by the Spitzer telescope's infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: How originated remains one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
It is probably the remains of one of the moons of Saturn who disappeared without trace 4,500 million years ago.
One of the largest and most sharp pictures taken by the Hubble telescope: The Galaxy of Remolino.
Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Misty Trífida located several thousand light years in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The Trífida name comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three), as a dark dust lines divide the burning heart of this area of stellar formation in three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic snooker: 400 million light years from Earth the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of merging abalanzan is the one to the other to finish colliding of irremediable form.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
For those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the nickname of Southern Molinillo.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Iris Misty in the constellation of Cefeo.
The nebula is located 1,400 light years is composed of dust particles whose size is between 10 and 100 times smaller than the dust particles that can be found in a house.
This image was created from images of optical and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located at 430 million light years from Earth.
This cluster of galaxies, called Arp 273, served as a model for the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this fog is the brightest young stars in our Milky Way.
This area of stellar formation constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Misty Rosette, also arise continually new star; 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole still no dust, gas only.
The researchers assume that was formed shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe could find mostly hydrogen.
Our window on the universe: The largest telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes has not stopped growing and the images that we offer have more depth.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
The mirror in the picture, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The interior of the Great Canary Telescope is located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented in order to save costs.
Despite this, reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
The drawback of this construction is more economical than the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so their mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller diameter mirror, the capacity is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescope in the world.
With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico), researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the infrared spectrum.
The ESO also will host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or the European Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered one of the largest in the world.
These are two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explore the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
On Mauna Kea is planning to build a new and daunting telescope with a diameter of 30 metres.
This is a picture of how it would be.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990 sends images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope search for extrasolar planets, particularly those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011 NASA announced that since the start of his mission had been located approximately 1,235 candidate planets.
In the picture are the final preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The telescope James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of the space telescope has a diameter of 4 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be looking for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the Big Bang.
The researchers assume that the south pole of Mercury there is also ice.
However, there is no hard evidence, because the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the North Pole.
For decades the radar measurements suggest the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the probe Messenger (2004), the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty that this is the case.

A search for traces in a country where people of 97 years are still considered young.
The tour through the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as a wild and romantic.
The minibus is moving forward with great din through the winding road that runs alongside wooded hills, rivers and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that is located in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here to the border with Iran is only a few kilometres.
Here are the "talyshi," one of the people who don't know much, apart from the fact that the Persian and Azeri and are very durable.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts a perhaps too solid architecture designed in the Soviet era, and that does not seem to fit entirely in a mountainous landscape so picturesque.
European tourists just come to this place, because the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 miles separating the two cities, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The astonishing wealth of the country thanks to the oil from the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this peripheral region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we celebrate the Feast of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
This is the director of the Museum of the ILC, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the lives of eight dozen talyshis of the place that have exceeded the 100-year-old. Fatulayeva points to a picture in black and white.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A child died at the age of 136 years.
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the pastor of sheep Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate that certifies.
And if we take into account that the older man documented lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, apparently still had time to conceive a child to the age of 136 years.
Was it wrong then Şirali Müslümov in his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontólogo at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this inhabitant of Central Asia.
"In some regions of China, Japan or in the valley of Hunza in Pakistan also live people of very advanced age," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about the age, especially when there is no civil registry.
Every day glasses filled with melted butter
It is a fact that, in a surprisingly frequent, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik tend to achieve a biblical age.
Currently, there are 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why do they live here in the south, so many elderly?
The Azeri Farid Mugimzadeh tourist guide explains that these are special genes talyshis.
The director of the museum, Mrs Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in the diet.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it seems logical that the diet rich in calories of talyshi, who love meat, bread and dairy products, and many of whom, in addition, drink a cup of melted butter on a daily basis, is so healthy.
Or perhaps it is the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the town of Lerik Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
Its 97 years is relatively young for what obtains in these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, moving tirelessly a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of the sons and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents long ago.
Also cavort from one side to the other two small children.
In the kitchen preparing tea for the guests, a tea serving in a typical vessels with curved shape.
Mirzayeva teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and under the scarf hides two long braids of dark blond hair that her son finds us proud.
I have always washed hair with milk, which is why I never has fallen and has maintained its color.
"I have never used either a shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
The pension is enough to live
It has always eaten only what was in his own farm: Tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my entire life I have never gone to make the purchase at a supermarket.
Then we talk of her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II.
However, all returned to normal when the "beloved father, Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds strange in the mouth of a woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult that professes to the fatherly figure of the nation, who runs his country like a dictator, knows no bounds.
He remained in power until 2003, when he gave the baton to his son Ilham.
At least older people of Azerbaijan do not know what is poverty.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) in monthly pension, an amount that you can live well, taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps the white son of Mirzayeva is right: "In our culture, the elderly are highly respected."
They live in a big family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this were not reason enough to stay alive for many years...
In the Constitution lack the expression "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo highlight the tremendous division that has gripped the country.
The future constitution, with Sharia law as a basis, it is very controversial.
The Egyptian president indulge in pathos.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that is my responsibility, before the people and before God, "he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Coptic Christians, liberals, secular and enlightened Muslims.
All of them, living without remedy so far in a confusing opposition, they are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As explained Mohammed Mursi, almost asking for forgiveness, has had to cancel temporarily the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand their own "in order to save the revolution."
However, neither the Egyptians nor the world know very well what the 61-year-old engineer with a PhD from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive of their power to the judiciary?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 members predominantly Islamists in a night meeting of 15 hours, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law."
However, what does that mean "principles"?
This was and remains open to interpretation, and it seems that the Islamists are going to take this vague formulation, as well as the legal room for manoeuvre that involves, to impose a more strict interpretation of Sharia law.
This is at least suggesting a new article added: In all matters relating to the sharia is compulsory to consult the Al-Ashar University, the country's largest Islamic institution with great power in the Sunni Islam.
It need not be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something which - in fact - would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft of the constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain the military jurisdiction.
During the dictatorship of Mubarak these courts served to exert a harsh crackdown on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As set out in the draft, the state has to protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote their morals and values."
It is a very imprecise wording in legal terms that, with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of the arts and literature.
This is not talking about anything other than censorship.
Of course, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
In another change prohibits offending or malign the Prophet Mohammed and their legacies.
However, it is not clear what is an offense and how it must be punished.
Equally questionable is the formulation that prohibits the "insult to the people"
Is it enough of a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer?
A matter of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been submitted to add to his signature and that, in his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be subjected to a referendum.
"The revolution has become"
Weeks ago that the opposition is arrayed against the superiority of the Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony in the afternoon of Friday in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to derail the Act before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning," said Hamdin Sabbahi, which ranks third in the lists to the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and ex-Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution should be "in the dustbin of history."
Via Twitter accused supporters of Mursi of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy."
"When we called the referendum to his palace and derrocaremos," says the opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brethren has not yet been expiada," was quoted in the media, the Egyptian opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that it wanted to monitor the referendum, so it will not be considered valid.
"The Koran is our constitution,"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community appealed to hold a counter-demonstration; for if not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, at the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafis took part in the same to the cry: "The people demand the application of the divine law."
Add "required to clean up the country," at the same time proclaiming: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, it would have led to a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that the supporters of Mursi did not want to risk that something like this happen.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those who oppose the draft of the constitution as supporters of same would have expressed their opinions loud and clear.
Now it is time to let the people decide at the ballot box what direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists has guaranteed a majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' even appears"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that actually should have lasted until February and have included all social forces.
The 48-year-old lawyer specializing in human rights and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face a trial for Mubarak's dictatorship.
Not because I share their ideology, but because for him, human rights are indivisible.
For this reason, he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear in the new constitution," he laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of the powers add to the three powers of the State made this lawyer was resignara.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and lead to Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is to abolish it," laments Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without the civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which notes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against them.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are discussing a monster that you cannot control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: Is the world's most fetid fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country bears some relation to their greed for an extremely smelly fish?
Take a series of overly cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of clothes wet and dirty football.
Leave it there for a week.
Then you can smell the aroma of the crippling rakfisk, one of the delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
Is covered with snow, the scenery is spectacular and the smell, always present, floating in the air.
The rakfisk is salted trout that is left to ferment in water, depending on how smelly that you prefer, up to a year.
And as it is doing more cold, the Norwegians come in droves to a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this delicacy of far more, so to speak, captivating.
"It eats raw and then drink a glass of aquavit for a drink," says Havard Halvarsen, fireman of the city that is also what is known as the "General" Rakfisk, which is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating the fish that is kept in small cubes and sipping a drink large quantities of the drink.
"Some people like more aquavit the rakfisk," says Havard.
The drink can kill the smell.
I feel some pieces.
If you can avoid it near the nose, not bad; it is not very different from a portion of sushi that has traveled a few miles by bus.
The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty ravaged Norway and in which, before the advent of refrigeration, the fish was kept during the autumn submerged in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is well fermented, lifts and, obviously with the senses inactive due to alcohol, eats.
Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of people in Sweden, the old rival and until recently not too much richer than Norway, came to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, an essential part, although quite smelly, from the past of Norway.
It is among the most expensive dishes that can be bought.
But, in fact, everything is expensive, a pint of beer or a sandwich will cost a whopping 10 euros ($14) each.
Norway does not appear on the agenda of international news and the majority of Norwegians love it.
The people here are still not ready to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist acribilló who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the event of 22 July."
The Norwegians find it hard to believe that a lot in their country is one of their own was capable of committing such cruelty and murder.
After much of the current wealth of Norway is the growth, since the early 1970s, one of the oil and gas industries, largest in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, while going through rakfisk trays and, with his long blond mane and striking blue eyes, represents the image of the Norwegian welfare.
"We are, as you say, prudent people."
His English, like the majority of people in this country, is impeccable.
"We do not like to boast, we do not like the ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything except for a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was dissipating money that he did not have during the years preceding the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet closed well.
"As long as we can go skiing in winter and hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eating rakfisk," she adds with an easy laugh.
I am in the snow queuing up to eat something; I have already had enough rakfisk.
Now a hamburger moose is certainly something different and succulent enough to taste.
But at night, the fish stinks.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many local held a dinner of rakfisk in which diners vote the best fish, or perhaps the most tested the nostrils.
In a live television has connected with a presenter who leads bow tie and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It seems the Eurovision contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here is our score, Havard."
There is laughter and applause.
A man falls out of the chair, perhaps defeated by aquavit.
Or perhaps the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start
While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take office, the correspondent of the BBC, Will Grant, analyzes the challenges that will face the new president and the different expectations of its population.
The traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad today.
In a city that, under the best of circumstances, it is already congested, since Monday has been installed a steel fence that cut several of the main roads leading to the city and that is causing a huge chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not to prevent workers could get to their place of work, but to prevent the protesters were able to reach the parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and will take over the management of the nation.
Faces a difficult task.
Mexico has been getting good economic performance during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is immersed in a war against the narcotráfco that has claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a strong commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," explained Mr Peña Nieto earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Office.
"I am going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal."
Before rubbing shoulders with the president of the United States, the previous political experience of Mr Peña was as governor of his home state, Mexico.
A very populous state and with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; The opinions are divided on the new leader in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, he recalls fondly.
Its residents attributed the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city you can drive through one of the new roads of Mr Peña Nieto, which represents a huge improvement compared with agrietadas and roads full of potholes that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plaques with his name at the entrance of a modern sports hall and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We are confident that he will make a real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the party of Mr Peña Nieto, the PRI.
"Particularly in terms of security and economy, we hope the interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the rating that the opposition makes lack of substance of the new president.
"It is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent view of the country.
It is a great statesman and, above all, is a person who knows how to listen. "
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that has a lot of people about their former governor.
En donde iremos "for Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be higher.
High hidden under sections of motorway is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also tough and urban.
Earlier this year, called for the intervention of the military to help in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, have been left abandoned in just the past two years the bodies of dozens of murdered women.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico, while Mr Peña Nieto was the governor, a rate much higher than that of Ciudad Juarez, sadly famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with killing of innocent women.
Critics of Mr Peña Nieto said, in the best case, which failed to address the problem of feminicide while he was in office.
The most critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the neighborhood deteriorated, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain the tears while I shows photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, his family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I came to his house, it seemed as if he had cleaned up the body," recalls Mrs Buendía.
"There were signs that he had been beaten and rigour de la mort had already been published."
While his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana notes from the walls, along with a cross that reads a single word: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says that he has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me as if it were an old chismosa, a disruptive, a quejica.
What they want is that one simply accept what they say and that street. "
"But that cannot be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much neglect," he says.
The presidential sash that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico during the past six years, and the new president has promised to give them priority during his tenure.
"I hope it is the same kind of president who was when he was governor," says the member of the PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza more fear.
Bradley Manning not reported ill-treatment, according to prosecutors
Prosecutors are trying to deal with the allegations of abuse of Bradley Manning during his stay in prison
The trial focuses on the period of Manning at the military prison in Quantico in Virginia
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the grounds that the imprisonment of Manning was severe
The soldier of the army is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to show Friday that the soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost many opportunities to denounce the abuse that now claims that he suffered while he was under military detention.
During the interrogation that the prosecution made to Manning in a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor Major Ashden Fein claimed that the records of weekly visits by officers of the unit that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaint about the treatment they received.
The questioning, which took place during a hearing conducted following a request by the defense to dismiss the case since his incarceration had been tough and that it had already provided enough punishment, came one day after Manning had testified that he had considered suicide while in custody.
The Army intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
At the hearing on Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning forms that the officers were following visits to Manning during his arrest at the military prison in Quantico, where he was held in maximum detention regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have made questions to Manning and scored their answers.
Fein on Friday when asked about the forms, Manning admitted that he had described the treatment given to her by the guards as "excellent" and the treatment received in the facility in general as "very professional."
The forms show no complaint of ill-treatment, despite the fact that the officers asked Manning directly on the treatment they received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about certain issues and that the officers who visited him had spoken of these problems and he had indicated that he would try, but they left no record of such issues on the record.
"Writing 'smooth' (after having spoken of the problems), but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problems," said Manning.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, Manning also asked why he had not complained about the treatment they received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a council in charge of examining the intentions of suicide had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the regime of "prevention of injury" under which was.
The military said that he had been put under such a restrictive regime, which is one level below the surveillance of possible suicide, to ensure their protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted to make the state more knew that I was well and (wanted to) must be under injury prevention... to be able to enjoy what, in my view, is a better quality of life," said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the base of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was going on or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world fell only to the Camp Arafjon, this cage," said Manning on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning said that, once transferred to Quantico, spent most of the day in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours without company.
Manning said that only he was allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, some flops, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, because it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning said he always had a light from outside pointing to his eyes while sleeping.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he gave a return at night, awakened him to turn around again.
The lawyer for Manning in January 2011 filed a formal complaint about the treatment they received Manning.
Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning on a plea that he had carried out in Thursday's statement, according to which, one night after being forced to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico, he was forced during a morning count desdnudo to stand in front of the guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to be covered with a blanket during the recount.
During the questioning of the judge on Friday, Manning said he thought of the order that gave him the supervisor who was supposed to drop the blanket that could have been covered, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to stop the fall.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked last night because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his flip-flops to self-harm but had not done so.
That night testified that Manning had withdrawn from his cell in his underwear, his flip-flops and his glasses.
His lawyers have the hope that the judge should have at least considered by the experiences that happened during his stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence if convicted in a court martial, which is scheduled to start early next year.
The defense claimed that it intends to make Manning is guilty of lesser crimes and defend other charges considered too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend, and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with the rules applicable to any person who is under maximum custody at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, causing illegally publishing information on the Internet, leaking national defense information and theft of public property or records.
If he is convicted of all charges, he could face up to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; he says that Mexicans are reminiscent of those hard times
Navarrette says that the Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, barely had fallen on the esplanade and arrived in the area of immigration processing and was totally confused.
A few posters showed the way to two lines: One for "Mexican" and another for "Foreigners."
I was there for a few seconds without being sure where it should go.
Having grown up in Central California, all my life I have been called "Mexican."
These are ethnic shorthand, in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York they call themselves "Italians."
Later I decided on "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And, in the homeland of my grandfather, the shorthand or the scripts were not necessary.
It was simply American.
I speak Spanish well enough to salir during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the level of vocabulary of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I got in the queue of foreigners.
I thought at the time of the week in which the president-elect of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always, to meet the leaders of these two countries, included: Immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was willing to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment is as likely to remain in Mexico as a Mexican who venture to go to the United States.
He wants to be associated with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc in North America in the style of the European Union.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue the fight against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he gave no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is full of resentment.
Probably the majority of Americans will never agree to that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced their leaders to cede half of its territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that remind you are everywhere.
So, at the moment in which an officer of the United States says anything that involves the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of its neighbours.
And the sons of Moctezuma are put on a war footing.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is that they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking of resentment?
There is a lot.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not.
The only reason why there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was one person, it may be that the father or mother or any of the grandparents, who closed the door of opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the north.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: Dark skin, a low level of education, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
To Mexico.
And, despite the fact that perhaps we are now living the American dream, having gone to good schools and have good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are experiencing is that the American dream, and not the Mexican.
It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but it is our loyalty.
It is for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class the people dislike us.
The feeling is mutual.
We see it as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and we look over his shoulder as if we were in a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In her view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, would not have gone.
And now we would not be trapped behind this curtain of silk, living in the United States, but, even so, as solitary souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a little girl, I remember that there is this rubbing between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the first with more robust know who they are and the seconds that bothers them.
Although it is a citizen of the United States, it is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either of the two.
We love to listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we see as Americans.
And in the United States are considered Mexicans.
Now, to further complicate things, from what I have learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to re-connect with the diaspora.
They want the Mexican-Americans to work as "ambassadors" of improvised Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would say to our fellow Americans, it is fantastic to visit that country and presionaríamos political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That is not going to happen.
There is too much resentment.
And, with wage inequality, rampant corruption and violence by drugs, many of us are not so sure that it will be a fantastic country.
I am afraid that you will be left alone with this idea, friends.
It is fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way in which they tried to Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still bitter about how they treated his family makes a lot less time.
Hmmm. "
Perhaps we are more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Can be one day a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the usual and useless discussions about who started first, lots of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed, and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, despite the fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be anchored in its former conflict, everything that surrounds them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything shattered like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in the regional turmoil.
Perhaps this will make their struggle even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that their lethal deadlock could desencallarse.
A war that neither lost nor is
At first glance, the optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, clashes this week have reinforced the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good beating.
And despite having killed some of their leaders and put pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populous corners of the globe, Israel has not been able to put an end to Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine is currently governed by its implacable rival Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, the leaders of Hamas might come to the conclusion that time is working in their favor.
Given that the Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas, Qatar has made him one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
The jubilant members of Hamas say the Islamic crescent is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, which dominates the party-militia Hezbollah, via Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamist trend could topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas's allies are threatening the king.
Especially in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and key Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not take too long for Hamas.
In contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are first cousins of Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas will emerge as the player that cannot be excluded, including Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, the hard wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.
In terms of the military issue, have put Hamas on its site.
The Iron Dome anti-missile system in Israel has proven its effectiveness and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
Israelis will sleep more quiet... for some time.
In terms of diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets fired from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, in part because of the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of a country aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to rise despite the fact that, according to international law, are illegal.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined a group of an even harder line led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the elections on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why coddle these twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If you really ruled in the West Bank, does not explode rockets as they have done their compatriots in Gaza?
It is better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing will prevail, although the Arab Spring could alter their calculations.
Although the Islamists to take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have much appreciation for Israel, its priority will be to address the internal difficulties.
Israel's defense budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
Start a war with the superpower in the area is unlikely to help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
The pragmatic Mr Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the cease-fire is a good omen and could mark the start of something.
The Israelis should think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination is creating a powder keg that one day will explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week blew up a bus in Tel Aviv.
The crackdown is undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography worsens the situation as it increases the Arab population.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay a growing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a boost from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the adopted sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: Two states and the transfer of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more momentum to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to curb the influx of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs outside the matter should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join.
This would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state that the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual state status at the UN.
Mr Obama also has an important role in terms of getting to bring Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term failed to submit his own plan for peace.
Back in the White House, it seems equally reluctant to devote their attention.
This attitude is a deplorable vision for the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The law of generic packaging of tobacco comes into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and body parts with diseases look on packs of a dull green, which are the same for all brands of tobacco
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, enters into force, replacing the logos and colors of the marks of a wrapper of a dull olive green, some horrifying images of body parts with diseases and representations of children and babies sick because they are children of parents who smoke.
With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the packs, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small font.
It is the world's strictest regime applied to the packaging of tobacco.
The federal government of Australia says that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by removing the traits that make this habit has glamour.
Rely on studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26 years, there is a 99% chance that it never will.
"You can see that children, even from a very early age, they understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their brand," said the federal Health Minister, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing, for example, how girls to do the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Despite the fact that Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and that these changes do not affect too much to the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would encourage the black market for tobacco, cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre, the British American Tobacco, in Australia.
Will increase the amount of tobacco that will bring counterfeiters in China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Others say that their business has benefited after the adoption of the law.
Sandra Ha, Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for and among covered with silicone to plug the unpleasant images of the packs had been shot almost from scratch two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
Mrs Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and that he was waiting for more stock.
"For us it is a good business."
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networking among the demographic sector that is the plan.
After a series of Australian laws that prohibit advertising on television and sponsorship of sports and forcing most vendors not to put cigarettes in sight, the tobacco marketing has been done online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to companies and local websites, but it cannot restrict it in foreign pages.
"If comercializas tobacco and you only have this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place in which to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase of reviews on brands from "ordinary people" posted on social networking websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders if it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video or whether any marketing company is behind all this.
The British American Tobacco Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what the new rules mean that in marketing.
The industry has even gone so far as to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic recusen the new rules; these countries are saying to the World Trade Organization that is unfairly restricting trade, despite the fact that none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
It is likely that the WTO issue a ruling in mid-2013.
Plibersek said that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering implementing similar laws on tobacco packaging.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce compulsory include images on cigarette packets.
 There are mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India is considering implementing tougher laws.
In Australia, many smokers are challenging.
"The photographs do not affect me.
I simply do not case. "
"You take the cigar and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth.
"Frankly, there is only one reason that would stop smoking: For my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack shop in the centre of Sydney, indicates that the uniform packs make it more complicated to place them on the shelves.
"Normally took an hour in desenvalar delivery; now it takes me four," says Yu.
"The government should have banned tobacco altogether, and then, is already, worth, is over and shut the shop," says while raises his hands upwards.
In a world constantly connected, it is not so bad a little bored
During the day's festivities Thanksgiving this year, unexpectedly I had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane in which volábamos suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had a lot of time to think about the boredom.
I will not lie.
Spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even if you have the means to be entertaining, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free shops.
But more and more scholars and experts in child development to praise the virtues of boredom.
According to them, it is good that we and our children, we aburramos from time to time.
Bored forces the brain to look for interesting options and encourages creativity.
Given that, at present, most of us are connected to this or that screen, not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept in good spirits boredom?
Yes.
And not.
But, as we will talk about it later.
Firstly, like many people, assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as he says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "boredom: A Lively History" ("The boredom, an animated story") published by Yale University Press in 2011, this is not the case.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii graffiti exist in Latin on the boredom dating back to the first century AD
We also need to consider how we define the boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many different ways," says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the research published and raise the idea before a discussion group formed by 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "wanting, but not being able to participate in an activity that fills you."
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but want to do so.
He points out that with the apathy there is the desire to do something.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the alteration of the process of care, associated with a low mood and a sense that time passes slowly."
The boredom may sound terribly similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood said that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or in the world, while the people who are depressed believe that the problem is with them.
Sometimes we believe that we are bored, when what happens in reality is that we have trouble concentrating.
In their study "The unengaged Mind: Defining boredom in Terms of Attention," published in the September edition of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues were referred to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard in the adjoining room a television programme to any volume that was not any relationship, others listened with the volume low, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group who heard the program with low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; focus cost them, but they were not sure why and what is attributed to boredom.
"When you're trying to concentrate on a difficult task or interesting, alteration of care can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, how to detect defective parts in a manufacturing line, a music that distract you can help you will not get bored."
"In fact, today we know that move or make scribbles, actions which are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, may actually help combat it, because it means that that person is physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stand still," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it is to be bored at some point: The delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to be bored than others.
To help measure, some researchers developed in the 1980s a "tendency to boredom scale."
The scale includes questions such as "many of the things that I have to do are repetitive and monotonous," and "there are so many things that interest me that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, argues that, using these scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to be bored more often than girls, and specifically require more external stimulation and more varied.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that is bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which was put in touch with 400 teenagers and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of teens said that he was bored in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said that when stufato was not in school.
On the other hand, the 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said that he did not know if the percentages of boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what we knew was that "adolescence is a period in which the boredom reaches its highest point," largely due to the fact that both children and adolescents are not gives them a lot of control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: It is good to be bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, we may be exposing absurd physical risks, such as placing bets or fall in the consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as shown by the investigations.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak of the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the issue for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the way that the brain has to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what is most appropriate.
If you're bored and you use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you see the television, it is possible that you will meet in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So, if your child is bored and you give an iPad, it is possible that they are no longer bored, but will not have learned to entertain themselves or dosificarse," says Professor Fenske.
"And that capacity of dosificarse applies to other situations," he says.
Your child will not only learn how to have fun alone, but they learn to be controlled better in other areas.
I do not think that we really want to praise the boredom.
But we should not be too critical of him.
Our aim should be, rather, to feel comfortable away from the trickle of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our view, we need more tiresome issue, but boredom is a wish too distressing and disturbing as to connect you with something that is worth," he says.
He points out that what people really want is a way to unwind and enjoy a long dead.
"In an environment where we are constantly sobreestimulados," he says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colorado: Without a book of instructions for the new law on the use of marijuana
Anthony Orozco, 19-year-old student at a community college and footballer of south-eastern Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal in the state: The possession of a few stones of marijuana and a pipe used to smoke marijuana..
Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends led by Lamar, on the plains near the border of Kansas, when stopped by the police.
The police found marijuana in the car and a time after Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and related items (petty crimes that each carry a fine of 100 US dollars) in which he was told the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," says Orozco.
What are they?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote that took place in Colorado for legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of minor causes for drug possession depends less on the law of the location.
Hundreds of minor offences for possession of marijuana they are canceling both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have ceased to file charges against those over 21 years for possession on a small scale, to be adopted legally once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative districts in Colorado have pledged to go ahead with the cases open for possession of marijuana, and people are still quoting.
At the same time, a number of cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent open marijuana stores, recently authorized, in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I do not know what will be the next thing," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those who are in charge of the regulations in the state of Washington are also dwelling on the matter.
Still looking for advice and to establish a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale; all this before the deadline, on 1 December 2013.
They say that, for better or for worse, Colorado is ahead of most states with regard to the regulation of the use of marijuana, first with therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Commission of control of alcohol in the state of Washington.
But Mr Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
"There is no real precedent that we will serve as a model," he says.
The law of Washington, called the I-502, enters into force on 6 December, leaving a year during which nadará between two stools, since the licensing system in that state does not yet exist, but the possession is legal.
In addition, there are some tricky mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this period, as a way of maintaining a balance between the demands of the state to provide an "adequate" access to marijuana prohibition and authorized to conduct business of cannabis within a radius of less than 300 metres of schools, parks, children's play areas and children's centers.
"Nowhere will find it more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for legal cannabis, a research group created recently.
On 21 November, Oates, the chief of police in Aurora, sent an e-mail to their police officers in which they reported that the prosecutor of the city would take action for misdemeanors for possession of marijuana for people over 21 years old, and that the police would file charges against these crimes "with immediate effect."
The chief of police, Oates said that they would enforce the rules of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue pursuing drug dealers and traffickers.
Weld County, in northern Colorado, the District Attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter vision.
After the vote, said that his office would continue to pursue cases of possession of marijuana, mainly to put pressure on consumers and decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to take action against those faults which at the time were a crime occurred," Mr Buck said in a statement.
The response has been difficult even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer cites adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, County District Attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the cases pending for possession.
"I do not believe that you are wasting our time to continue to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Despite the fact that 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that the use of marijuana for recreational use at the heart of the government and the judicial system would be easy.
Contradictory reactions that occur throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials about the great environmental experiment in this state.
"This is a cultural barrier with prosecutors in the district," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the defendants for possession of marijuana and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of the law on marijuana.
"I have spent so much time taking people to court, in fact, still cannot accept that it is legal," he said.
As the first states that they consider the small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become the test cases at the national level regarding the legalization of drugs.
While lawyers and state officials have a new frontier of legal sales, also are very anxious to receive instructions from the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of the legalization of marijuana are hoping that the Department of Justice will subside.
Despite the fact that there have been some prominent arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has allowed that there are mostly business selling marijuana with these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states.
"Although it is likely that the drug agents do not pull down doors to confiscate a small bag of drugs, probably will be reluctant to allow the operation of shops regulated by the state for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted under the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, a exasesor of anti-drug policy of the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments adopted moratoriums on any new store of marijuana, despite the fact that it will take about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we are enabling someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying what voted in favour of the community to vote in favour of what the state voted. "
There are many questions about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "I chased until mattress of Oxford for being a Tory"
It attacks the university for their views only now
I do not remember any time in my life that has not been dreaming to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my elder brother had been in which I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that encouraged the two pillars of civilization: The free thinking and tolerance.
However, the two weeks to occupy my seat at the Worcester College in the late 1980s to study the career of History, had already packed their bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and she broke down in tears.
My friends were puzzled.
The Evening Standard claimed that I had left because they did not tolerate that some fellow university kept sex in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson announced joking that I had gone because I was forced to drink in cups shucked.
The truth was less fun.
Huí there.
Yes I fled, because he had been subjected to a systematic harassment and intimidation.
Extravagant not because of my name, nor the fact that it had come from a private school.
I was harassed by a single reason, in the cradle of the so-called illustration was something intolerant and barbaric: My father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative Party.
You might ask what this is now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is undergoing a similar persecution.
Institutionalized and growing hatred towards the students of the conservative party in Oxford is such that, last week, a group of them demanded the same level of equal rights for homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (grouping of students from grade) of Corpus Christi College claim that they are "often seriously paragraphs, personally attacked and treated as undesirable persons" for their political ideas.
They want to create a seat on the board of equal opportunities for their college to ensure being able to express their opinions freely.
Their situation was not aided by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The paradise: Young, bright and right-wing) on the politics of students and presented to the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
The graduate student showed Joe Cooke, former president of the Association of the Conservative party at the University of Oxford (OUCA) in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a walking stick with a silver hilt.
In other universities, conservative students say that they are treated as a "scapegoat" for the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20 years and vice president of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend of left-wing universities.
People assume that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even know. "
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old and a student of history in Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says that this is "uncomfortable," while Stephanie Cherill, 19 years and elected president of OUCA, said that the attitude of the members of the JCR towards people who are centre right has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as for the well-being of the members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford I was more than a single.
I entered the university in September 1986, was an 18-year-old terribly shy.
The hatred towards the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, former student, a title "Honoris Causa" after cuts in funding from the Higher Education.
The atmosphere would have done a shake of Stalinist horror to any.
Already during the first days of the week to welcome the new university, when new students are known and unknown to the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that I expected.
I discovered that the professors were not only a blind eye to the mockery that was made of the conservative university, but participating in it willingly.
The policy of the miners' strike, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa came to the wood of the seminar rooms.
The first thing that I had to translate into English, French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
Not say no.
Pitt, a shallow man with a face that looked like biscuit dough, knew well how to expel bad bile.
"Is it that the thatcheristas refuse to learn French or is that, quite simply, are stupid?" Asked.
The other pebbles university.
My eyes were burning from the tears that tried to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in their free time, as long as they are not too busy knowing people," "Pitt.
I returned to my room like a banshee.
That night I sat alone at dinner time at university; then I felt a slight slap on the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he told me kindly.
"I am afraid that this is how it goes the thing.
They pick on anyone who is suspected of being Tory.
For me it is very complicated, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so you will be even worse.
Many Tories newcomers appear to be Labour. "
Later, in a local pub, I tried to conceal a cowardly attack.
I emphasised that I did not agree with everything that Mrs Thatcher said.
This trick was useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, which, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, he said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contaminated. "
Other students took this ditty.
I became the dirty perverted.
"How do you have sex the Tories?" Asked one.
"They give a beating each other, isn't it?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have been felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could one day lead a normal life in Oxford?
I would be forced to be with people who think like me only after dark?
Does that make me Labour and repress my natural tendencies?
The three years that I hoped posed as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only Tory was openly Professor Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History aimed at my college.
They hated him for being not only of the Conservative party, but also Thatcher adviser on foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches.
Was just over there.
Hated the place because it was considered provincial and insignificant and his adherence to the Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"Here you're not going to be happy," he told me.
I started to travel daily from Oxford to my parents' house in London, finding refuge in my family and friends more open metropolitan mentality.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why.
I am not believed.
When he was studying there in the 1940s, he accepted all the political points of view.
"But if it is the best place in the world," he said with sadness.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dreaming spires.
Until my friends communists always had an impeccable attitude. "
His sore eyes began to nublarse.
"Dale another opportunity.
I am sure that they have done so only to joke.
I would break my heart if you desire. "
Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional stress was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to the pressure and had renounced his faith.
The following week, during a seminar in which he hinted at another professor of History, speaking quite seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Red shame inside, admití my parents that I had been "brainwashed" and called them "old stupid."
The truce lasted only a short time.
It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my academic career at Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I was nestled inside of fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors abandoned.
When I left the suitcase and I caught the first train to London.
He never came back.
Perhaps I call weak llorona.
But anyone 18 years of age should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only been 14 prime ministers of the Conservative party, but, as of today, nothing is hidden behind a deserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to the notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Couture," which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized during the opening of "Valentino: Master of Couture," a tremendous retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his "house" for the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with its unmistakable Italian accent.
This show is the pinnacle of a story whose protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but that could not have been written without their distinguished clients.
Valentino has always felt fascination with the distant and rarefied world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, which is open until 3 March, many private letters and photos with the signing of the most prominent of the aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon and Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino taught these personal memories as trophies of their social promotion: The city of humble dressmaker Rabbi, in northern Italy, idol of the "international" jet-set.
To be in love with royalty is nothing wrong.
"At least they did not shut down the butts of their bonus on your carpet and make some beautiful celebrities of pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to his chalet in Gstaad," explains the exmujer "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties as Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance to the notoriety.
And yet, it is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza nor forget the charisma of the dressmaker.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were 20 people, among which were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decor, the food, the music, everything looked and felt his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and loved," recalls the "top model," which began to work with him during the Paris Haute Couture Week, in 1995.
"Never goes out of fashion because their designs are works of art," topped off.
Parade of lineage
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but loves well matched.
He loves to people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous catwalk sixty meters long that proposes a change of roles: The visitor takes the place of the models on the catwalk parade and needs to see a "dream" audience that features masterpieces of Valentino, such as Jackie Kennedy chose to dress for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, costumes used Monica vitti in "La Notte," or a wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In that audience of mannequins glitter names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von plane und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Habsburg Sofia.
Naty Abascal and dressmaker, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it well.
It was a pair of pants, a shirt, a vest, "Gillette" and a jacket in the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift that he gave me," says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I prefer him over others because of their femininity, for his great love for women, because it enhances our beauty," added the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors used, have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion prescriptora Patricia della Giovampaola d 'Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time he took a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of having reached the age and the opportunity to be able to use one of her evening gowns.
Finally the time has come to the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to use at a party at the house of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress, with skirt blowing up, "corsage" drapeado and neckline word of honour.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d 'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D 'Arenberg keeps his clothes off the dressmaker with "maximum care... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also the set of memories associated with it."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller in her wedding with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the dressmaker called his seamstresses) to develop this ivory silk suit with inlaid pearls, twelve different types of lace and a queue of four-and-a-half meters.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialist press, the dress represents a milestone in the haute couture of the end of the twentieth century, "the return of the clients of the high society."
For years, which is obsessed with the "savoir-être" of the elite, now Valentino is the best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest-ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates so many honors as any of the spouses of her clients.
"I have always been struck by its refinement, its calm, its clean and perfect," says D 'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was on the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"I was flawless, time does not pass for him."
If it says a princess...
The hardest job in the world: The human mules Kawah Ijen
For four euros, carriers of the Indonesian volcano are risking their lives and health loading 70 kilograms of sulphur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is hell and another that literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living making sulphur Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To this end, it has to go down every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth solidifies on contact with the air.
After booting large rocks of sulphur, which in total come despite some 70 kilograms, carries two bamboo baskets that burden on their shoulders through steep stone paths.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2.386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted porters takes more than 40 minutes to rise at a snail's pace, keeping the balance with defining and measuring their steps to tune and not fall over the precipice.
They know that any catch could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who despeñó years ago by the cliffs of Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur that extract
Once above, open passage between the tourists that the photograph as if they were circus monkeys and laboriously carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has located a little further down, at 1,850 metres above sea level.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960, and never better said, its workers, who pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to launder sugar.
"As is normal loading 70 kilograms, about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip," explains Anto, who usually make three doors a day.
It takes three hours in each and ground ends, but allow you to gather 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a pittance for such an inhuman effort, is triple what would win in the field.
"The hire of the miners is very high here, where the harvesting of coffee is paid to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)," clarifies the carrier, who previously worked as a mason in the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was $75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the coal was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town close to the volcano, for a good reason that, in Indonesia, is as strong as sulphur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs constantly and irritate the eyes by the toxic gases
In its 27 years, Anto carries three playing in Kawah Ijen his skin, whose sulfur has already begun to pass bill despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs constantly and irritate the eyes of toxic gases that the volcano.
It is the price we must pay in order to achieve his dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," promises a more than acceptable in English.
Punished for life, this could be sympathetic and intelligent young tour guide, waiter or a hotel receptionist, but instead makes the work of a mule.
Sharing a unclean wooden hut with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulphur is flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow becomes blue and shines in the midst of darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto alumbrándose low to the crater with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he has purchased with their money.
About 400 porters carry baskets of sulphur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its huge profits, the mining company has not mechanized extraction of sulphur in order to save costs nor provides any equipment to the porters, who work on their own and both the weight.
In fact, not even being part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge for camera that, along with the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), this natural park rangers charged to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for the beasts, and not for the people," protest Madrusin, a burly 42-year-old carrier that has been in Kawah Ijen three decades, since leaving school.
Capable of lifting up to 110 kilos, ensures that abide working "everything it can" because it needs the money to educate their three children, aged between 18 and 10 years.
I am not jubilaré, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life
Although the sulphur burning throat and rankles the eyes when the wind suddenly changed and traps miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, are so hard that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... beyond, of course, their usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and sores on the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Swinging the basket on his back, already Unainik can only carry 50 kilograms to his 53 years.
Every day, he and his colleagues start 15 tons of sulphur at the volcano, three trucks to move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away from a path of goats in the bush.
"I don't jubilaré, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life," proclaims Unainik opening the mouth, where we are missing several teeth.
Of their five children, the eldest, 30, also works loading sulfur.
Time passes, but the misery passed down from generation to generation, one of the toughest jobs in the world: The making of Kawah Ijen human mules.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the race, stress and the cost of the properties and education for not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my wife patriotic, the fulfilment of our civic duty and we believe life!
It may seem implausible that these verses are part of an announcement of mint tablets, but despite that - or perhaps because of it - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "We will put a Bao (bun in the oven" to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is hoping that with the announcement will draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music for people to fulfill their national duty. "
This is purely on the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in reproducirnos ourselves, so we felt that this was an issue that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried a lot of things, like launching perfumes with pheromones or organize evenings quick quotes (speed-dating).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why not make the most creative as possible in order to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
It's not taken so lightly is the government of Singapore.
Spends $1,300 per year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and doles out tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city rich and high-tech state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, in accordance with its national division of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 - known as reposición- rate was in 1976.
So why Singaporeans do not have more children?
As Wei Ming, director of the Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, said that it was due to a "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in unmarried, and to delay marriage and parenthood, which results in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy hat tip to drastically increase immigration to deal with the decline of the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where barely disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are critical for maintaining low wages and not integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the governing party of Singapore experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher taxes and quotas for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on economic growth of a nation, tax revenue, healthcare costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to build as many small houses.
For example, has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The authority of urban development has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoebox," that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface of 46 square meters and have been very successful sales.
However, there is concern that can promote a lifestyle of unmarried and discourage developers who want to build big houses, family members.
But Lim Yew Soon, director-general of the real estate company THE Developers, said that his "shoe boxes" are sold much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that the units are depleted days, even weeks, faster than the larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidelines for developers, before they put obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed out
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, when talking with Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the city, it seems that they are not going to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, the houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are putting off," says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But for me it is important to have my own money and time," says another young man of about 20 years.
Men and women mentioned his career, stress and the cost of the properties and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push their citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans are those who have the final word.
The private off line is private online
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Real Academia Española is the quality of private or "the sphere of private life that it has the right to protect any intrusion."
What is private for a 16-year-old girl?
How to apply this definition in their daily lives and in social networks?
Can you see the dangers to which it is exposed to air on the internet situations that surely not share it offline?
ElPeriódico interviewed five boys aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, associated the term "something very mine," on the personal level, and "in the key and user name," when applied to social networks.
"My deepest secrets does not rise to a post," says Jorge, ten years ago, when trying to explain the meaning of private sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it accounts for the last two years.
"They are very secret secrets, my mom can get to know them, but not everyone," he says.
In FB gets pretty images or games.
I also entretengo with my acquaintances.
"I would share a picture that is not mine, or someone who is doing the ridiculous," he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene pictures of naked people, crimes or writing violent or humiliating comments.
Jorge claims to know the 35 friends in FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
The majority are relatives.
The mother is included, holds the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write tweets interesting.
"I don't know if I answer, I just go," he adds.
"Social networks are entertaining, I can speak with distant relatives or with my friends quickly," he says.
Do not hesitate to answer that would never accept a request for an unknown person.
Nor would you if someone to recommend to a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14 years, is different.
The teenager has open accounts at Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter admits not know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"I am not afraid, because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, none has hinted or asked for the address of your home or your phone number.
"If I had put pressure or I simply demanded the sack of my mind," he acknowledges.
Joseph became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy did not fall outside the experiences of what is now known as ciberbullying.
An acquaintance of my friend were extorting in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"Never knew who he was," he says.
The victim, according to Joseph, not closed the account.
"Only put privacy."
He then explains a series of steps to configure the account safely.
Unlike George, this boy would rise known photos in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes I would, if I fall ill or I want.
"Although I know that this is ciberbullying," he says.
The key questions
Marielos Porras, teacher of English and a degree in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites have changed the rules of the game," says.
Batons points out that the academic Marc Prensky, a master's degree in teaching at Yale University and author of the book Digital Natives and Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
They are digital natives, children and young people who were born with the technology.
"We are digital immigrants that we need to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.
He says that the issue is complex, "because we are asking them to have a definite opinion about what should or should not disseminate, publish or say at an age that maturity does not provide for that."
"Also to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what is privacy for children and adolescents is through questions that make them think.
"Tell them not to do so does not," he added.
Then, Porras lists some options: There are things that don't contarías to a stranger, why do you do on the Internet?
Or, do you would like to publish a photo of yourself as you have made a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
When photos of party labels, do you have requested permission from the other people to label them?
And one more, all they need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act on line as they do off line.
These are the same rules.
"One out of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, should be equal in social networks," he says.
Surveillance,
Queen of Scots Guard, a university professor, elementary teacher and educational consultant, says that it is essential that parents read thoroughly the policies of social networks.
To understand each of the snippets they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guard, is key to remind the children the lesson of "don't talk to strangers."
The Unasur summit ends without making public the Declaration of Lima
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without being made public the Declaration of Lima, announced previously and theoretically signed by the seven leaders attending.
He repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but Foreign Ministry sources and presidency initially pointed out that they were going to deliver after the closure, but later claimed that at some point will be published on the website of the Peruvian government.
To be consulted by the text, said that the contents had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, for a few brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information from the summit was restricted at all times.
During the day only aired in the press room, the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricted."
The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by press spokesmen for some of the governments of the Unasur attending the appointment, though not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for more information.
Subsequently, the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is the pronouncement of Humala, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd Summit of South American-Arab Countries (ASPA, and on that occasion, despite being required repeatedly by the press, nor spread also called the Declaration of Lima, who had previously announced.
On the official website of ASPA can confirm that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both of these international events, the Peruvian authorities made certain that had insured transmission systems for all journalists but limited to obtaining information.
The summit concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling of the Court in The Hague to settle a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that will respect the decision of the (ICJ), which starts on Monday in The Hague to hear arguments from both sides, in the process that Lima filed against Santiago.
"We will abide by and execute the judgment that defines the differences that today we are going to the international court," said Humala, together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will remain a country respectful of international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts," he added Piñera, and greeted with a handshake to Humala, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that will be submitted to the ICJ occurred after Colombia reported this week that the Pact of Bogotá that had agreed to submit to the failures of the international tribunal, following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua, which was seriously flawed.
The summit was held with absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended Unasur since 2011 following the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after midday of Lima.
The president read the final document in which reported that 16 were adopted and agreements were fixed lines of action for 31 projects between South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments.
Among the resolutions adopted mentioned that the countries of UNASUR will give "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are extending the agreements on residence."
It was reported that "promote actions to improve cooperation in the fight against insecurity and citizen against transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, access to the internet at a low price in all corners of South America, and meet jointly and efficiently the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand nustra productive matrix and look forward to a better future for our peoples," he added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural areas and borders... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two points to a greater connection with Ecuador, but gave no further details.
In addition, the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country to their reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," which is currently excluded.
Latin America's need to remain as a region of peace and prosperity, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues underlined by the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting their participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his pair of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat with respect the maritime dispute following a ruling of the ICJ, questioned by Bogota.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) it is possible to have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
"We are going to review all of these roads, are not exclusive, including the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega I hope I can tell you that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would be on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the taking of command of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, as part of the summit, the bloc's defense ministers met in advance to approve the Action Plan of the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in the field of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay make up UNASUR, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that "South America, in this case, yes, you should learn from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, Peru, told state TV that "Europeans were killed in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland."
He defended, in that sense, the project to establish citizenship initiative to encourage the member countries of the Unasur.
"We need to ensure the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country, as is the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that we want to return to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favour of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and take into account those who have signed the pact of San Jose on human rights.
Those who give chair never commit to anything, and, on the other hand, we all signed the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington under the financing of the United States," he said in allusion to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said that he is not repented of that decision because it has not betrayed its principles, but it has respected its "deep democratic values and human rights."
He added that, at the time, "there was reasonable suspicion that Assange was extradited to a third country and not respect for their process."
He criticized, in addition, the Swedish justice to demand that it put on its territory to the interrogation of an alleged sexual offence "when the Swedish legislation allows you to do it by video conference, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa said that there is a risk that deteriorates the physical and mental health of Assange.
"I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that I had a small problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
There is a danger that deteriorates their physical and mental health by being locked up in a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
"This complicates the health of any person," he added.
Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the granting of a salvaconducto that allows you to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there had been discussions with London in search of a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We don't negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing talks.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, años Garzón, is doing a series of procedures in different European institutions," he mentioned.
And opined that "if Britain gives the security clearance this morning is running out."
And if Sweden, as well as to their legislation, as it has done in other cases, questioned Mr Assange in Ecuador's embassy in London or interrogate him via Skype tomorrow will end this problem.
Strap used to assert itself as a defender of freedom of the press and explained that it "does not tolerate mediocrity, bad faith and lying, which infringe freedom of expression."
"The biggest enemies of freedom of the press are not evil and wicked politicians but bad journalists in terms of profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
At that point they are no longer welcomed these journalists "neither bankers nor the bourgeois and hegemonic countries that dominate in Ecuador," and said it would be re-elected "will deepen the revolution to continue the path and the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least until their next election, to argue that the agency "must be strong and do not tolerate opportunism and marbled the legality" because in reality "shattered the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president was also perfectly "relevant" to his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now negotiate with Nicaragua maritime boundaries between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
For the time being is not abide by that ruling.
It is a problem between a South American country and one in Central America.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to walk together.
You have to process them so wide to overcome them and move on.
It also relied on a good conclusion of the dispute over maritime boundaries that kept in the same court, Peru and Chile and opined that "it is right for Latin America seek international bodies if the two countries agree to accept that it is" hard to fault.
In reference to the possibility that is present as a candidate in the next presidential election in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term said that he sees that possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite hard."
Correa said that if it loses the elections of February 2013 will retire from public life.
Personally, I was never interested in power, but in situations such as the unjust socio-economic poverty in Ecuador that can only be corrected from political power.
"My movement Montcada 6 believed that it was I who ensured that likely victory, because we have to accept that liability questions," he said.
To win it would be my last period in the presidency and hence we leave public life.
And if we lose.
"It is a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I have just spoken with the Venezuelan vice-president Nicolás Maduro and tells me that he went to a treatment that was already planned, routine, which is expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"Does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chavez," he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state in Lima today participated in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration in order to sustain progress, equality and security.
Deaths from AIDS are now because of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the result of the test: AIDS positive.
"It was as if I dropped a bomb," referring to the recalling the time of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to do more "suavecito" without apparent success.
The boy hid it to his family.
He decided to take charge of their illness and began to learn about it; with such efforts already celebrated his birthday 43.
It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 years ago, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options, and more stigma.
Then, until the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided bid farewell "because it contained a cut."
Then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of his illness, many people still come when the virus has already wreaked havoc, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least for the first cases reported, "the great achievement at the moment means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, it is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after saying that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific journal.
Infectólogo and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal judgment, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of involvement of the immune system with patients at the start of the diagnosis, with best expectation for those who are not drug users: Up to 30 years with a CD4 count of 200 and 50 years ago, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, this means that those who receive the diagnosis of HIV-positive at the age of 25, under these terms, "while remain in control can live without problems until the age of 75 years," explained the interviewee.
For sizing this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While the mortality rate has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS) annual report, it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths until May of this year; however it ensures that there is universal access to anti-retroviral drugs since 2005.
 - Why there are still deaths?
 - To me, it seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
This view, so we has happened in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we have not had shortages of medicine, the problem is that patients are very advanced unknown because their state of infection, or in the late stages of the disease.
He gave a blunt fact: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when you have an opportunistic infection, what needs to be done in order to have a greater impact on the overall mortality, is to make more early diagnosis and, therefore, have to offer screening tests on a massive scale, to all the people who need it."
In its proposal coincide specialists and officials from the State Council AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to be tested at a private laboratory, only motivated because I had made a friend and, despite his young age, was already in the era of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous growth that is one of the most common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some people think that they are going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I am going to die, I better reviento three times a week," they say, not in my case.
The change was to improve, good food, I exercise, I take the drugs.
To date, their parents only know that suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but shares, I would certainly to me and the other person," listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share their intimacy with Milenio JALISCO to motivate his testimony to those who today, in the framework of the World AIDS Day, they are afraid.
To take the test, if they were at risk, the sooner they know whether they are HIV-positive, it is better and if they already have a diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
This, his message, sums up the theme of the AIDS battle this 2012.
The counter condoms
There are large gaps between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist who has taken up the cause Tapatio around HIV.
And the largest is in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task "actually has increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now give us a hundred packages, and that is all well and good, but it turns out that there are those who today still do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"What do they want?" Is a common question, with derision and value judgments of social workers, school counsellors, employees of pharmacies and health personnel, who did not want to expose teenagers, said the communicator.
He proposed to redirect this inefficient allocation; that condoms are not only behind the counters and those 100 are in public bathrooms dispatchers sites that frequent the young.
It is not encourage promiscuity.
Nor is pay the chelas and the motel, and said the governor Emilio González, to ask him if he would have distribution of condoms in his administration.
"This is not sexuality, it is best to bring condoms to those who already engage in a sexual activity," he said.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13,435 (12,158 cumulative cases of AIDS and HIV 1,317).
The state is fourth place nationally in cumulative and new cases of AIDS and 13 °.
92% of the infection is sexually, 6% in the blood and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50 thousand people may be living with HIV because there is one case recorded by 4 to 5 people who do not know.
Ratified by a US appeals court ruling that ignores the restructuring of the debt of the Group Vitro achieved via a commercial competition in Mexico, the stage set a bad precedent for any company with national ramifications in the neighbouring country with solvency problems.
It would seem, then, that the procedures in endorsement of survival of firms that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the stars and stripes, against the grain of international conventions.
In practical terms, the endorsement of the ruling issued on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the court of bankruptcies for the northern district of Texas, left helpless to Mexican firms face the possibility of seizure of their property beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to come to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming three inconsistencies.
First of all, as long as the trial judge noted that creditors must be governed by the Bankruptcy Law of the United States, the court of appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the procedure is the main commercial competition processed in Mexico.
The first point would mean to ignore the international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with trans-national profile.
In fact, to that end, they created the UN Model Law for the Distribution Uniformity of International Commercial Law, acting as an arbitrator the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the ruling states that without the vote intercompañías, recognized in the critical mass of commercial debts that they had with their parent subsidiaries of Vitro, had not been achieved the majority required to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility of the Mexican laws recognize.
In fact, Vitro has not been the first case in which it accepts the scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts intercompañías endorsed the Federal Institute of Competitions Mercantiles.
What is certain, however, is that subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway creditors of Vitro who fought against him in the Courts of the United States, that is to say, "vulture funds" as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
It omits the fact the Court of appeals.
From another angle, he blames Vitro of the difficult situation they faced from 2008 to only glanced at the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, where he received blows the barbs to the country.
Meanwhile, the signing of the Gonzalez Sada family appealing for reconsideration before the appeals court so that the vote comes to full, that is to say the five judges, given that only three voted.
It will not prosper the Cerciorare resource that requires the review of the process by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
How serious the case is that the court sidestepped a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Law of Competitions Mercantiles, pointing out that this case involving with attachment to the conventions signed by both countries to tie it with Chapter 15 of the Law of bankruptcies in the United States.
Moreover, it is pointed out that the country surrendered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is to say the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensure fairness for debtors and creditors.
Billiards two bands: In Vitro hit them and hit them into the country.
General balance
Shelved for several months reports placed on the table by the Mexican unions against the Aviation exdueño, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Trade Union Association of airmen already found the bottleneck.
The analysis, led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Securities and Banking Commission who is accused of obstruction of justice.

The Dragon Mart surround

We are talking about, as you know, a colossal sales and distribution center for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean country's products of the wall, with an area of housing to match for employees of 150 companies.
Previously the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the Southeast area to oppose the monumental subjects that swept through part of protected areas and raises the mother of all feints against the industry.
The ACTA died
Overlooked by the government as a requirement of the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances, the ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its initials in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property has passed the matter to the file.
As you know, the action was taken despite the fact that the Senate had disqualified the possibility to construe as freedom of expression in social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
The globe-trotting basketball Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the tabloncillo sport and, thanks to him, he traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico has a mental collection of the history of the local basketball is as broad as the Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And that is before a stroke would it to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, it was as a player of minor categories, the National Basketball player, possession and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros of Bayamón or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I wore many hats in the basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when he was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," recalled Reyes Primera Hora during a visit to his home in Puerto Rico, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life."
Reyes did not exaggerates when making such a statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with pictures and memorabilias that indicate his long career, prove it.
Bayamón in the heart
In all, which holds more excitement are those that recall its passage through the Vaqueros since the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years serving as coapoderado or possession of the franchise.
"Those were my best years, I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be a part of eight championships Gorchakov since 1967, whether as a proxy, coapoderado or leader.
There were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships shifted from 1971 until 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of debut of Jerome Mincy in the BSN.
From then on took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great manager, "said Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had headed here and I was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "You have a good strong player, 6 '7" tall.
Do you want to? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players of Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended to the sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativizado and was one of our best shooters.
I remember that he said that if Mincy had given him a championship to Bayamon, Gausse would help bring another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse enjoyed it, but at a distance, as in 1988 was already in federal supremo.
By that time he preferred to enjoy their records and Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when he won for the first time in the United States during the Olympic in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got fourth place and should have been bronze if not for the Canadian referee who made us repeat the final move for the second time, said Reyes.
Does this group of the 1990 World Cup National Team is the best you've seen?
It is among the best, as he won the Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won and we gave him a gold by the team from the United States, which was quite similar to that we won the bronze medal in the world.
The team not only repeated to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had to (Javier) "Toñito" Columbus and James Carter young people, the brothers Leon (Francis and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who was unable to be in the 90 due to an injury in the knee.
A team that perhaps was not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the Olympic of the 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Nieves, Paul Alicea and Rolando Hourruitiner youth to replace the players suspended by the mess of the Panamericano de Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
What has been the best player of Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, this has been Piculín Ortiz.
Their numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as it did Piculín.
And that's not counting his career in different leagues that played.
Who has been the best Puerto Rican leader?
This is very difficult.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Young people, I like very much the work of Leo Arill.
What you think your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and at the beginning of the 1990s the BSN took up to 17 teams in a season.
What you had to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, the boys of Ponce played only in your area and only face teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsorias certifications and course for leaders, officials and referees.
That I am pleased.
What do you do now?
As much as I do is listen to music, watch videos of the music of my time on YouTube, disfrutarme to my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Elizabeth, who has always been with me.
The actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world-famous for its central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." In the television series "Dallas," in which embodied an unscrupulous businessman, malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predator oil magnate J.R. Ewing on the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died on Friday afternoon due to complications of cancer, according to a statement from the family provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, representing again the iconic role that he liked," said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the holiday of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said her publicist, Jeffrey Lane.
He had joy to all who knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I extrañaré.
"It was a genuine person and lived life to the fullest," said Gray in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted that he had drunk a lot for years.
In 1995, he found a malignant tumor in the liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas," Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," broadcast on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
It interpreted the captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is disrupted when he finds a genie, played by Barbara Eden, and takes it away to live with him at his house.
He was also protagonist of two comedies that were shortly in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work included roles in the film well received by critics in "The Group," "Harry and Foolish" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his masterful interpretation of the odious gracefully J.R. which led to Hagman to its maximum overdrive.
The the CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was on the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The phrase "Who shot J.R.?," designed to generate expectation around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character was nearly killed, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars in risky gambling houses.
It also helped give the series a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a chapter in November 1980, an average of 41 million viewers watched him and turned to "Dallas" in the second most watched entertainment program in history, behind the finale of "MASH" in 1983, which took 50 million viewers.
She was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. the embarazó and then threatened to cross it out of prostitute unless it is outside the city, but also had other reasons to attack it.
Hagman played Ewing as a corrupt insatiable with a charismatic smile: A rogue businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), was held.
"I know what I want on the tombstone of J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
It should say: "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only negotiated that lost.
Victoria Principal, one of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, both inside and outside the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us, that we were lucky.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success for the channel TNT.
He had already finished the recording of five of the chapters for the second season and a sixth was in the process, the chain reported.
There was no immediate statement from Warner and TNT on how to handle the loss of Hagman.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress / singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when he was in 1931 during her marriage to attorney Ben Hagman.
Proved luck in theatre in New York at the beginning of the 1950s, and later served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While he was there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin ': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't put anything there that I thought that would hurt somebody or affect them in some way," he told Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant became promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer at a hospital to attend to patients fearful.
"I advise, I value, I meet with them when they come to their surgeries, and then," she said in 1996.
I try to offer some solace, as "do not be afraid, it will be a bit uncomfortable for a short time, but will be fine."
He was also anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Start course that explores the "End of the world"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when Professor of Religion Stuart charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, knew that he had an irresistible hook: The end of the long "countdown" of the Mayan Calendar, December 21, to which they have clung many people as proof that it is the end of the world.
But charmé had no idea of what is expected in the next couple of months: The cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called "deudarmagedón" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists of the end of time believe that will start the Apocalypse.
"I realized that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester that there has been," said charmé this week to students at Rutgers University-Camden (New Jersey).
If you look at what has been happening in the world today, as if we were 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mindset.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory, the last of the story.
In Temple, the associate professor Barry vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the end of the world."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We look at why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way in which offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If the nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, could ignite a war.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how compared with real-life examples.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible," said vacker.
On the main campus of the Pennsylvania State University, Professor of the History of Latin America, Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art History and Anthropology, have made team to teach a course, titled simply "The end of the world."
"Don't add '2012' for always having the option to teach the course again, in the event that the world will not end," said Restall.
Despite the "impending ruin," students should study, generating projects and taking final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves no other option than to students work "until the same night in which it is assumed that the world ends," said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"Became saturated in two hours," said Restall on its course for students with high average, which was filled with 35 students.
We receive e-mails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, people asked if there was still place.
Students, for their part, claim that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to console themselves to themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a student of the race in Religion and Sociology of 23 years of Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, it is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a student of the career of Psychology and Nursing, 25, said she had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I had never heard of a class that could teach it," she said.
I enjoy.
But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said to believe in the expiry date of 21 December.
"Our first project focused on the Mayan prophecy and desacreditamos it in a certain way," said Julie Zeglen, a final year student at Temple, 21, of West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he said that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom of these speculations.
"Elsewhere, people don't think about this," he said.
In mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph were, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about a course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, suggesting an exception to a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will start to think immediately in the next date" or philosophizing that on 21 December is the beginning of a period of seven years after the end of the world.
Students and teachers are taking lightly the date.
Several said they plan to go to parties "of the end of the world."
"Maybe call some friends to riamos us together," said Samira Ford, a student of communications for 20 years.
