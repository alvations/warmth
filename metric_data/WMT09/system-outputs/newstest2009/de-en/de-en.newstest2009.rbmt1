The Prager stock exchange falls against close of business into the deficit. 
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prager stock exchange could correct the losses. 
The transactions with the shares of ?EZ almost reached half of the normal Tagesgeschäfts. 
The Prager stock exchange immediately fastened to beginning of the on Tuesdays-businesses at the break-in of the Monday as she/it sank about further six percent-points. 
This time, the reason lay for the break-in at the embankment Street. 
Also in the Czech republic, the reaction of the market points to the result of the vote of the American house of representatives, that it had refused, so to support a stabilization-plan for the local finance-sector. 
Fell the shares in Asia 
The shares experienced a dramatic case on Tuesday at the stock exchanges in Asia albeit the indexes could even out in the course of the day a part of the losses. 
The index the hillside singe stock exchange in Hong Kong lost in the course of the business-day almost four percent-points, could make up for a part of the losses however later, consequently the decline decreased on approximately 2,5 percent. 
The index hillside singe China Enterprises, that observes the movement of the Chinese shares at the stock exchange in Hong Kong, sank about 3,8 percent, into Shanghai, the markets were locked. 
The shares at the stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, the losses reduced on 4,3 percent however then. 
The stock exchange in Taiwan sank after the local index about 3,6 percent. 
" The timing for the rescue-action in the USA is uncertainly and will influence " the finance-markets world-wide, according to the boss of the monetary-authority in Hongkong Joseph Yam. 
Hong Kong decides although it belongs to China, his/its monetary-politics itself, therefore independently from the Chinese central bank. 
The interest rates in Hong Kong move on the same level like that in the united states. 
The American legislators should come back after words of the Australian premier Kevin Rudd as fast as possible at the negotiation-table and should give a farewell the design for a support of the financial system. 
Otherwise it threatens that also wide countries of the break-in would be concerned. 
A bloodbath of American shares 
The American house of representatives has refused the plan for a support of the financial system on Monday, for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillions KS?) should be used. 
The legislators ignored the invitation of President Bush so to support the plan. 
According to Bush's opinion, the plan would regulate the basic causes for the finance-crisis and consequently would help to stabilize the entire economy. 
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the most important share-indexes recorded the biggest break-in in more than 20 years. 
The Dow Jones index sank about almost seven percent, he/it had finally recorded a similar break-in in the year 1987. 
The index had already sunk before the vote, however hardly there were indications for it, that the design would not come through in the deputy-house, the index experienced a free case. 
Congress does concession: US-Regierung can pump 700 billion dollars into the banks 
The uppermost representatives of the American congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a wider form of an agreement over a finance-help for the American financial system. 
Over it should be coordinated beginning of next week. 
The American legislators reached in conversations over the dismissal of a rescue-plan in form of a finance-help for the American financial system in a scope of 700 billion dollars, approximately 12 trillions crowns, a breakthrough. 
However, this still means no victory. 
The congresspersons must namely still negotiate some details of the agreement before they publish the Endfassung of the law and can vote on it. 
The plan to the support of the financial system is negotiated on Monday in the American congress. 
On Sunday, the chairperson of the committee said this for banks - and finance-services Barney Frank of the agency Reuters. 
In the senate, one could vote according to different statements on Wednesday on the plan probably at the earliest. 
According to economists, a communication should over it that the plan is adopted that is first important psychological factor for an upswing of the finance-markets. 
A " disillusion " occurs on the basis of the complicated mechanisms however as they could help the markets also in the practice. 
Paulson: The plan must be effectively 
" We have achieved an important advance. 
We have clarified our different opinions to it, how a package should look to the stabilization of the market, Bloomberg said the Democrat Nancy Pelosi opposite the agency. 
Could still occur according to her/its/their words on Sunday a final-vote. 
Representatives the legislator met in the night to the Sunday with the American finance-minister Henry Paulson in order to lend the government-fund his/its final form. 
This intends a purchase of unsalable hypo-bar-assets of the finance-societies, that the finance-companies fall into heavy losses and endanger the stability of the entire system. 
" We stand at the edge of a definitive unification over a plan, that will work and that must also be effective on the market. 
They must continue the recovery-plan even further, however I think, we have reached the goal ", according to Paulson. 
A signal for Asia-businesses 
The global finance-crisis is also reflected in the stock markets clearly, the strongly sinks. 
According to the words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are troubled still to reach a final unification Sunday ago in the congress. 
One wants to calm down the investors with it before businesses on the Asian finance-markets, that lie in the first time-zone, namely where a decision of the congress could influence the businesses on Monday. 
When both chambers of the American congress will vote on the law is not yet quite clear up to now however, also obscurity rules it whether the negotiations could not fail in last minute because of a problem afterall. 
The legislators hope that it is given a farewell in the next days. 
The law will however still experience some changes. 
The total certain to the help for the system should be divided into two parts. 
The initial 350 billion dollars shall as quickly as possibly ready is put, as President Bush demanded. 
The congress can blockade the distribution of the remaining money however if he/it has the impression that the program doesn't fill his/its function, in fact with further 100 billion dollars and later the definite 350 billion dollar. 
Bush assesses advance in negotiations positively 
The president admittedly has a right of veto with this decision, however the congress can outvote his/its veto. 
The basic idea of the program is despite these changes however exists remained that was based on it, finances for the purchase of bad hypo-bar-investments, whose value is fallen, to attain, because Americans are capable hundred thousand no longer to pay back her/its/their mortgages. 
" We have worked out everything. 
The house of representatives should be capable to vote on Sunday on the law, the senate then on Monday ", according to the republican senator Judd Gregg. 
Also the American president Bush appeared contentedly with the advance. 
His/its speaker Tony Fratto explained, Bush is contentedly with the advance of the Saturday and " estimates the mutual troubling to stabilize our finance-markets and to protect " our economy. 
Limitation of golden parachutes 
The chairperson of the Bankenausschusses of the senate Christopher Dodd, the leading negotiator, let transpire, the legislators would have agreed on a responsibility for the money-program, the protection of the taxpayers before losses, the conclusion of privileges and a schedule for the funding of the plan. 
The new law shall also the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the societies, that are involved at the program and put down, restricts a committee one, that the supervision should be incumbent on over the fund. 
The department of Finance should lead this. 
" We have worked very roughly on it and have reached a big advance in direction of an agreement, that works and for the market and for all Americans important is ", according to Paulson. 
The plan reckons also with a help for homeowners, who have problem with the repayment of her/its/their mortgage. 
The government should negotiate new installments with mortgages, that she/it buys up, with what the goal exists to lower the monthly expenses for the debtors and it them, to enable, to keep her/its/their houses. 
Marek: Psychological help 
The proposed plan is a good idea after the main-economist of Patria Finance David of Marek, however the transposition becomes very difficult. 
" In fact therefore, because one doesn't know, through which mechanism and about which price the problematic assets are bought up. 
That will be for it decisively, as the finance-sector and the government apportion " the losses among each other, Marek told the server iHNed.cz this week. 
Whether now the plan or beginning of next week is given a farewell, is not crucial according to Mareks opinion. 
It is " much more important that the congresspersons agree on it to support the plan and that she/it him/it as fast as possibly gives a farewell. 
The psychological meaning of the agreement over it, that a dismissal occurs, the most important ", emphasized Marek, is in this moment. 
Duel on knife's edge: MP3-Player against Handys. 
We discuss you with your election 
While each Handy MP3-Dateien can almost play, no MP3-Player can still telephone. 
Therefore it looks of course so that it is better, itself only one telephone, to buy. 
Despite all, there are reasons for it sufficiently why they should get itself an autonomous Player. 
The election depends the prospective proprietor on the type of the utilization and the claims completely. 
Certainly, one hardly buys itself for at home a great expensive record player in order to be able to tell by the sound the newest album of Maxim Turbulenc of itself on it. 
First such musical newness don't appear on LPs, and from qualitative view, there is also no objective reason for it. 
Have LPs with type skirt, jazz or blues in the shelf however, you dream of a such probably at least. 
So, that is also expressed simplified with the music on trips, therefore with compressed music, - music in the MP3-Format. 
Also here, there are price - and quality-categories. 
For the one, it is not acceptable maybe to pass out eight-thousand crowns for a Player, as well a Pink-Floyd-Fan will probably come to terms with headphones for twenty crowns of the market hardly however. 
Two extremes, between which there is area for any enough. 
The selection is gefächert broadly. 
Also the lifespan of the batteries is crucial. 
Some good Music Player can play much more than only music, but they manage that, which Handyses can, not once in passing. 
No modern appliance is as universal as the telephone to start. 
Beside the primary functions, telephoning and him/it ledges, it can return music and videos, both lifts, it has a better once, once a worse camera and can maybe also navigate. 
And if one still includes the Smartphons and communicators, one has almost one small computers in the bag. 
It is a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and can photograph no TV. 
However the universality of the Handys entails also disadvantages. 
The more functions use you on your Handy, the more frequently you will reload it must. 
And one of the biggest energy-gluttons is the pass of music. 
Only few Handyses can play music longer than ten-twelve hours, mostly it is much fewer. 
In this sense, Music Player (specifically the simplest) are clearly more efficient. 
Therefore you should reckon with the cheap Handyses with it that they cannot play music longer than a few hours. 
If then you from and at still telephones, you rather buy yourself/themselves another charger for the office to the security - that is valid appliance also for teurere. 
With MP3-Playern, you won't have this problem, also the less good endure nonstop business at least 9 hours with a time loading. 
Another problem exists then if one wants to cover up the music on the Handy. 
Unfortunately only an inferior part of the appliances owns an USB-Abschluss, furthermore each Handy cannot be connected directly without particular software to a PC. 
Of course one can cover up the music on a storage-medium directly, however only few fix-reading-appliances get done without reduction with the tiny storage-cards, that use in Handys, becomes. 
With Playern, you require no particular software until on exceptions (iPod). 
You/they need to feed the appliance only over USB-Port with music from your PC. 
Most Handys and Player position even a music-library, arranged after the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or for example the evaluation through users. 
Some appliances portray only the tree-structure of the Adressverzeichnisses, like like the Windows Explorer, some can both, iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowons, intelligent telephones with operating system. 
Player are easier to serve, Handyses can more 
With the selection of a concrete appliance, you should especially inquire about the lifespan of the accumulator, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of the sound and of course also the Bedienkomfort. 
Music is scenery for you above all and hears you she/it every day in the streetcar only shortly for example, an any Handy, that plays MP3-Dateien, is enough then. 
What each Handy truly already almost can. 
You/they must not also control particularly which music-formats a Handy or a Player can process. 
MP3S manage all, and the most music, that you receive, will be exactly in this format. 
The format hears spread to that the most, and furthermore most appliances can play also music in the WMA-Format. 
AAC, a format, that uses Apple and his/its iPods, is less usual. 
Better Handyses also make possible the purchase of music online. 
One needs the corresponding sides of a Providers or another supplier only over mobile Internet to call, and already one can acquire a song or album. 
This service already can at and for itself a beating argument for it why they should get itself a Musikhandy is. 
Unfortunately the offer of the Provider is badly and restricts itself mostly only to fast radio-hits. 
The prices are not the lowest either. 
Generally however, one assumes it that exactly this type of the sale of music, be it over GSM, Internet or wireless Internet, will master the music-industry in future. 
Most carry the Handy on itself. 
If you have desire to be able to tell by the sound itself/themselves of something, you reach after the Handy into the jacket-bag, during which Player forget, at home lies. 
It depends on it however whether you also carry headphones or at least a wireless Freisprecheinrichtung on itself always. 
If not, you can fall back on the integrated loudspeaker, that each Handy almost owns, but only the fewest MP3-Players. 
The probably biggest advantage of the Musikhandys will lie for many in the price. 
The cheapest normally cost less than three-thousand crowns. 
For three - and four-thousand crowns already receive you a quite decent Walkman. 
The biggest Handicap will be for most that no normal headphones are with it. 
The best and technically ripest telephones with one 3,5-mm-Öffnung for normal headphones costs up to fifteen-thousand crowns. 
The advantage of the Player lies in the easy service on the other hand. 
The simplest - and not absolutely cheapest, sees selection, - Player can really serve everyone. 
A minimum at functions, the similarity with the service with the earlier normal Kassettenrekorder or for example the record player is obvious. 
No collision threatens in form of an erroneously employed mobile Internets and an afterwards horrenden bill for data-transfers. 
They should now reach for which appliance 
Also the cheapest Handyses, for example Vodafone 527, own slot for exchangeable storage-media, type M2, microSD and Ä. one normally. 
Even if a corresponding fixes you nachkaufen, two thousand crowns are enough. 
However respect. 
With the basis-models, normally only cards are supported with a maximum capacity of 2 GBS. 
Only the most expensive can read also 8-GB-Speicherkarten. 
If you already possess a Handy and want to buy itself another affordable MP3-Player, then you reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. 
According to capacity (maximum 2 GBS) must put you the table then no longer than 1100 crowns on. 
Belong to the more selective listeners, you take rather specialized Handys - Walkmans, Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung. 
These appliances have autonomous Bedienknöpfe for MP3, and the Bedienkomfort gets him/it of one single MP3-Players so. 
Sony Ericsson, his Handys has Walkman the same user-interface from the series, is the widest here like the individually sold MP3-Players. 
The same services in the same price-category from up to four-thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GBS) and a long accumulator-lifespan, normally 15 hours, at most up to 35 hours, MP3-Players achieve you the producer mentioned above. 
The first virtual supplier already gets in this year to the Czech republic. 
Maybe 
The mobile-radio-market in the Czech republic is quite ripe, the Czech suppliers offer practically all services at, as they are offered also by her/its/their partners in Western Europe. 
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual supplier, who forces the classic into lower prices. 
Becomes maybe this no longer long on itself lets wait. 
That the Czech mobile-radio-suppliers work to the most expensive in Europe at all, we have already often reported on it on Mobil.cz. 
This confirmed incidentally also the telecommunication-authority ?TÚ, that alerted to it, that the price is higher than in the rest of the European union for a SMS here. 
After the last steps of the European commission in the area regulation of the Roaminggebühren comes it to a paradoxical situation so probably - for some customers of the Czech mobile-radio-suppliers becomes SMSS from the foreign countries cheaper than is at home. 
How does it come that the prices are so high in the Czech republic in the comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, the competition, that really does a fight-announcement, is missing. 
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech republic, there are three mobile-radio-networks and a penetration far of more than 100% however. 
The mobile-radio-suppliers like to bitch against it about it that there is extremely much competition for the Czech market. 
Also the chairperson of the council of the Czech telecommunication-authority (?TÚ) often agrees with him/it Pavel Dvo?ák, with that had often expressed in the past, that there is no place for another supplier in the Czech republic. 
It is probably correct, that a classic supplier with one own network no longer has particularly many chances, incidentally he/it would probably also find frequencies hardly still. 
There is another possibility however - a virtual supplier. 
Exactly the admission of virtual suppliers on the mobile-radio-market brought a clear markdown with itself, on which also the classic mobile-radio-suppliers had to respond then. 
There was still with it before the admission of such companies like Tesco mobile or Virgin mobile for the market in Great Britain similar votes like in the Czech republic. 
It has turned out however that there is place for such suppliers and that these can be truly successful. 
Incidentally, one needs to look not for examples long. 
In February this has reported we over the start of the virtual supplier Mobilking in Poland. 
In only a half year, this supplier succeeded in winning more than 100 thousand clients and to rise to the five-biggest supplier of the country so. 
Behind Mobilking, the finance-group Penta, that among other things possesses U:fon in the Czech republic, stands with it. 
The advantage of virtual suppliers exists with it that one can concentrate on a much more concrete target group. 
In order actually to be able to work, virtual suppliers of namely much few customers need as a classic supplier. 
You/they need no relatively high expenses for the construction, the business and the maintenance of a mobile network namely. 
In the world, the virtual suppliers normally define themselves as Low-Cost-Firmen out so - she/it what is however often accompanied by a less extensive service-offer offers cheap telephone conversations and SMS. 
So, Tesco mobile offers in Great Britain SMS about the half cheaper than his/its rivals at least for example. 
How the example of Mobilking shows in Poland however, it can be also a quite good move to favor a target group cliche-ful not. 
This supplier directs to men namely specifically. 
" Real fellows choose Mobilking - the supplier, that pleases them and that can trust her/it/them, according to David Seibert, that CEO of her/it mobile Entertainment Company, the operator-company of this virtual supplier. 
, To say heavily, whether a similar concept like in Poland also in the Czech republic foot could grasp. 
Also the press-speaker of Vodafone Miroslav ?epický doubts it: " The Czech market is relatively small for a market-segment, on which most virtual suppliers are based. 
Furthermore, he/it is relatively satiated " from the view of the service-offer. 
In the Czech republic chance-free, the mobile-radio-suppliers think 
It is however almost sure that, if a virtual mobile-radio-supplier conquers the Czech republic, this not Mobilking will be. 
" We admittedly speak of an expansion of this successful project, however in the Czech republic the negotiations don't look especially hopefully. 
A market-admission of Mobilking will rather occur " in other countries of our region, says in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz Jana Studni?ková, press-speaker of the finance-group Penta, so. 
Indirectly she/it confirmed so that the present mobile-radio-suppliers in the Czech republic have not inclined to this thought particularly. 
In the opposite, they try to do everything for it that no potenzieller rival originates. 
Her/its/their interest in a start of a virtual mobile-radio-supplier shows time the group GTS Novera, that would like to take another step, already for a long time in order to become a real rival of Telefónica O2 Firmenkunden in the area. 
" We have a big interest in it, our customer not only party-network - but, to offer also mobile-radio-telecommunication-services. 
And the earlier, the better. 
Over this possibility, we have repeated negotiated with all Czech mobile-radio-suppliers. 
With some of them, we could already reach " negotiation-advances, according to the press-speaker of the group Pavel Kaidl. 
Maybe, better times now come. 
From not official information, it follows that the first virtual supplier is to be expected until end of the year maybe. 
Up to now however, this of an insurmountable wall of the silence is surrounded. 
" In this moment, we don't assume that place consists of the Czech republic for a full virtual supplier. 
The Czech market shows big Spezifika opposite other markets. 
Up to now, no subject has still spoken to " us with a complex and serious project in this area, thinks in his/its explanation for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sr?e? from the press-department of Telefónica O2. 
Also further suppliers point out the Spezifik of the Czech market. 
The press-speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the explanation of O2: " Up to now, we have still found no viable and on both sides advantageous project, on which they could rely further. 
And she/it adds: " In the network of T-Mobile, a virtual supplier will hardly appear until end of the year. 
We had already to be available in this moment a concrete offer, being able to think all the for a short time have. 
Vodafone rather directs his/its attention toward the fulfillment of the requests of the own 3G-Lizenz. 
Miroslav ?epický thinks to it: " For negotiations with potenziellen virtual suppliers is open we, especially in the area division of expenses and infrastructure. 
We consider exactly this from the view of the customers the best. 
The main-strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in the search after a partner to the construction of a divided network for a fast mobile Internet ". 
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand 
The action of the mobile-radio-suppliers is easy to understand, another supplier was called more competition, this would turn into sinking prices and leads through it also to a decline of the profits. 
Why they should therefore help such a rival with the market-admission? 
That the suppliers can pull at a rope, if it is about something, also the long covers about the formation of U:fon back and forth. 
The probably strongest pressure in direction ?TÚ went at the moment as U:fon came on the market, from the society T-Mobile from. 
Also the publicly accessible information of the ?TÚ-Webseitens covers that. 
Now however straight U:fon is suitable as argument why they should not admit a virtual supplier. 
Martina Kemrová noticed to it: " The competition-surroundings of the mobile-radio-market was furthermore still strengthened by the market-admission of a fourth mobile-radio-supplier recently. 
Under consideration of the character of the mobile-radio-market in the Czech republic is obvious that a new protagonist at the market itself and above all his/its services high requests would put. 
The absolute disinterest of the Czech regulation-authorities astonishes in view of this approach-manner of the mobile-radio-suppliers however. 
It is not only the stand of the ?TÚ, that unfortunately in Czech - in the difference to Great Britain and further high developed states - not the area of authority, to intervene in the economic competition, has. 
This possesses exclusively the office to the protection of the economic competition (ÚOHS). 
This covered his/its quite typical stand to this entire problem however. 
" The market-admission of a virtual mobile-radio-supplier would be possible then after a contract-conclusion has occurred between a mobile-radio-supplier and a virtual supplier over the Anmietung of the necessary infrastructure. 
Up to now, no such contract was completed, because the offer potenzieller prospects was not sufficiently interesting " likely for the classic suppliers, so in his/its answer on our inquiry Kristián Chalupa of the department outside-relationships of the ÚOHS. 
Such a formulation would not surprise from representatives of the suppliers. 
From an authority, that the consumer-interests represent and among other things should watch on it, that nobody abuses his/its position on the market, this is more than dubious. 
Especially, if Kristián Chalupa adds: " In the foreign countries, where virtual suppliers work quite normally, is to be observed that her/its/their market-admission has contributed to a markdown with mobile telephone-services. 
Doesn't belong the pressure on the correct working of the market and a markdown to the interests of the ÚOHS probably however. 
Almost already stirred unison of the three mobile-radio-suppliers, that results from her/its/their reactions, is truly shocking at this case of that. 
The question, whether it is truly only about one coincidence, lies on the hand. 
Equally like the absolutely same gas-price with the gas stations certainly only coincidence and the consequence of a hard competition is. 
" The authority has discovered no indications, that indicate an action directional against the competition, in this matter and consequently she/it has also no reason to intervene on any type in the issue. 
No one of the suppliers has a dominante market-position, consequently he/it doesn't also have the corresponding elevated responsibility for his/its action on the market. 
Probably also the regulation-authority lacks the necessary instruments for an opening of the mobile-radio-market for virtual suppliers for telecommunication ", Chalupa quoted in his/its explanation. 
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many debatable points. 
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, worked out from the ?TÚ, after the telecommunication from the view of the economic competition one single market is. 
On such a market, no one of the Czech mobile-radio-suppliers occupies a dominant position then of course. 
Some experts offer another view-manner however - for the market-admission of a virtual supplier is always necessary the consent of the network-operator. 
And the mobile-radio-supplier has - logically - for his/its network the monopoly. 
The it means that he/it necessarily occupies a dominant position in a certain segment. 
Even if one doesn't go along with this argument however, it should be a warning for the ÚOHS at least that three mobile-radio-suppliers proceed notably similarly. 
Troubles of a row of prospects, including the mentioned society GTS Novera, cover with it that they come with negotiations with all suppliers upon very similar obstacles. 
The Abwälzung of the responsibility on the ?TÚ is a quite usual trick, with which the ÚOHS of the whole issue dissociates itself, in the telecommunication-services then. 
This was already to be observed in some similar cases. 
Unfortunately it has not succeeded to push through the expansion of the areas of authority of the ?TÚ into the novella of the telecommunication-law, given a farewell recently, on the area of the economic competition in the telecommunication albeit a row of experts of it had made a slip of the tongue an improvement of the situation. 
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know that only all too well, however probably they have otherwise-y interests. 
It already goes, if nobody hinschaut 
Working of any pseudo-more virtual suppliers first remains unheeded, from which it in like the Czech mobile-radio-networks several gives. 
It is companies, the proper price list for mobile telecommunication-services, that are however only partly public, spends. 
Normally, it is about companies, that act Multilevel-Marketing in the area, namely. 
Own mobile telephone-services offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others for example. 
The price lists of these companies reach normally only too select. 
The joke of the matter is that the company appears opposite the operator as classic Firmenkunde, that orders a big quantity of SIM-Karten. 
As important tidings, he/it gets particular price-offers and other offers then. 
The problem consists of it that the business-conditions of all Czech mobile-radio-suppliers a like gearteten resale prohibits. 
There should be cases, that you describe, it can be then what can lead to a completion of the cooperation with the corresponding society, Martina Kemrová answered our question to this problem. 
It is however quite unlikely that something similar doesn't around-speak itself with the responsible of the mobile-radio-suppliers. 
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, it can be about thousands customers. 
No operator opposes such an action however. 
Doesn't flow them from the activity of these companies to neglecting profits namely, they become simultaneous - in the difference to the actual virtual suppliers - not through the actual official marketing impairs. 
Miroslav ?epický alerts to possible problems: " The law makes possible such types of speculations, the services of these companies only of a very low percentage of the customers are used despite all. 
These must accept in addition, that the SIM-Karte doesn't run in her/its/their telephone on her/its/their name, they cannot fully own it like the normal customers of the mobile-radio-suppliers " therefore. 
Already alone the had to would seem to the ?TÚ at least strangely however. 
Furthermore, another question opens itself for the ÚOHS. 
Do the mobile-radio-suppliers lock the eyes before such an action, why do they balk against a virtual supplier? 
It is to be added, that the ÚOHS to the disclosure of such activities has quite strong areas of authority, and if it doesn't want, it doesn't must itself with the explanation of the suppliers, they would know nothing of it and her/its/their business-conditions would prohibit this, is content. 
When the Czech republic is no longer the most expensive 
Like in the text already several times was emphasized, the market-admission of virtual suppliers entailed a clear price-decline with the different services. 
Has practically with it in all countries, where virtual suppliers have originated, tries the classic suppliers, whose to prevent formation practically more or less. 
The arguments used by them were practically identically - a too small, as well as too much satiated market, problems with the quality of the services etc 
Into the sophisticated countries, the regulation-organs reached however exactly in these moments one, that the interests of the mobile-radio-suppliers but that of her/its/their customers tried too true in no way. 
Be it through formal measures or not-formal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operator originated, and this followed further. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulation-organs throw themselves the whole case like a hot potato. 
Going out from our experiences we cannot dispose that obscurity is in the areas of authority in these cases more than favorable. 
However, we don't throw the gun into the grain. 
If the background-information are correct and a virtual supplier appears soon, the Czech mobile-radio-market will sit down in movement maybe soon again. 
If a supplier admits the formation of a virtual mobile-radio-supplier, the ÚOHS won't remain idle if it goes therefore to refuse further prospects to discriminate. 
And the Czechs will finally telephone no longer more expensive than the rest of Europe then. 
The new Czech hymn has four new versions. 
Pick out the best 
Be able to tell by the sound the four versions of the new Czech national anthem of itself. 
On Sunday, premier Mirek Topolánek put the new receptions of the national anthem on the occasion of the day of the Czech state-ness in a ceremony where my homeland is before. 
The hymn was played in by the orchestra of the national-theater under the management of Ji?í B?lohlávek again. 
Four versions are available - with male or female solo-chant, in choir-setting and in an instrumental-version. 
Kate?ina Kns adopted the chant-setting? ?ínková and Adam Plachetka. 
The adapters of the hymn-versions are Otakar Jeremiás? and Jaroslav Kr?ek. 
On the server of iHNed.cz, you can equally all four versions listens to. 
For B?lohlávek, the Czech national-song is one of the most beautiful hymns. 
Already earlier he/it had told the Czech broadcasting, he/it has selected singers with young, representative votes, that are prominent and popular, for the solo-variations. 
" From the beginning I have with both and then also with the choir try to keep a clear diction so that one understands the text well so that an unison originates ", according to the conductor. 
The Czech national anthem commits her/it/them next year 175. Jubilee. 
The song of Kde domov m?j sounded 1834 on the stage of the Ständetheaters in the originally Czech piece Fidlova?ka of Josef Kajetán Tyl for the first time, the music came from Franti?ek ?kroup. 
It became popular, and the people assumed it spontaneously. 
The first stanza of the song turned after the formation of the Czechoslovakia in the year 1918 into an organic component of the national anthem then. 
One of the seven state-symbols remained it also after the formation of the autonomous Czech republic. 
As sound the " new " hymn 
The Prager traffic-businesses transport on Wednesday also on a chip for the first time 
The Wednesday, that 1. Octobers 2008, will enter into the history of the Prager traffic-businesses as a date, at which gets on into a subway, streetcar or a bus the first passengers, who carry an electronic coupon in the bag instead of a paper-ticket. 
Einhunderttausends can buy these itself persons, who possess the chip-card Opencard, at present approximately.

The coupons are since yesterday also over the Internet on the sides of the traffic-businesses www.dpp.cz available. 
The service was called on until into the in the afternoon-hours of over four hundred customers. 
The ones, that use the Internetverkauf, can really forget the edition-window in the subway-stations where they had to wait in long snakes for her/its/their paper-tickets up to now regularly. 
You/they buy the coupon over Internet namely, this is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branch offices of the city-library. 
" At these positions, also a counter stands the travelers with trained personnel by the disposal, that prospects discuss with the Internetkauf and play " also the coupon on the card, the speaker of the project Martin Opatrný so. 
One can be able to play the electronic coupons beside the libraries also at self-service-vending machines on the Opencard, that in some of subway-vestibule appropriate is. 
How do such vending machines look? 
You/they are red, reminds at ticket-cancelers, the passengers have maybe already noticed her/it/them in the subway-stations Roztyly, Bud?jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská. 
" At present there is in the city five of it, until end of the year, it should be " eighty however, Opatrný adds. 
A vending machine controls the coupon instead of the driver 
The service of the vending machines, that from tomorrow will work, is simple. 
One must introduce only the chip-card, and the coupon acquired previously acts by itself. 
The electronic coupons satisfy not only in the capital but also in the surroundings tomorrow. 
Therefore in the suburb-trains and on the Buslinien with the numbers 300 to 499, with which above all the inhabitants reach from communities of method-Bohemians' region into the capital. 
The conductors have reading-appliances, with which they can test the term of the coupons after time and zone, " in the trains, that belong to integrated traffic to the Prager, explained Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid the ticket-control. This organization composes the timetables for the Prager traffic-businesses. 
The suburb-buses have fix-reading-appliances at the cash register with the driver.

Here, the information is shown to the validity of his/its documents on the Display of the appliance. 
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the USA 
The Sudeten German had requested in the year 1945 about the incorporation of the Böhmerwaldes at the united states. 
This follows from a letter, that stores in the collections of the Südböhmischen scientific library. 
If we cannot be component of Germany or Austria, so we would like to live under the patronage of the united states from America at least. 
With such a wish, 1945 should have turned some groups of Sudeten German to the US-Präsidenten. 
This sinks has remained from a letter, that gets in a private-archive, forth and that is stored in the collections of the Südböhmischen scientific library today. 
The German of Krumau ask the American president in the letter, he/it shall the return of the " Sudeten-district " - that on the basis of the Münchener agreement of Hitler was earned - at the Czechoslovakia doesn't allow. 
" We have understood the situation right and want really to be us sure the words that the American units as oppressors and enemies don't enter German territory but as rescuers ", it is called in a letter, that with the words " people, that the fate of the Sudeten at the hugs lies " signed is. 
Since the connection at the Czechoslovakia the Sudeten German - in knowledge of the Czech national-character - has suspected, that they would expect brutality, thoughtlessness, Unverständnis, suppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take on for today and forever the protectorate over the Böhmerwald. 
" We cannot believe, that you speak regardless of the opinion one quarter-millions residents this area a state foreign for us, that suppresses minorities and tries to remove and has contributed nothing at all to the victory of the Allied Forces purely, to read in the letter is. 
The reason for it, why the authors cannot sign, the fear is before revenge-desires of the " Czech oppressors " supposedly. 
If the US-Präsident doubt tends at the fundamental attitude of the Böhmerwalddeutschen, be it sufficient if he/it initiated a referendum in the Böhmerwaldgau over it whether the inhabitants become part of the USA or wanted to live under the protectorate of the united states. 
Albeit the text of the letter may somewhat naively sound in present-day knowledge of the postwar-history, he/it draws a good picture regarding the then expectations of the Sudeten German according to opinion of some time-witnesses however. 
Even if the Bohemian German had to suspect at least, that they would negotiate her/its/their deportation from the republic, only few of them admitted themselves such a possibility at all. 
Some waited that the united states and Great Britain for the Sudeten would negotiate a type autonomy. 
Again others believed, they could simply remain in the Czechoslovakia. 
Also the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis, confirms them/her/it. 
He/it was put into the war as Budweiser Deutscher with the navy at the Baltic sea. 
As he/it came the war into British captivity in the end and they brought him/it into a war-prisoner camp after Holstein, further Bohemian Germans came dozen to him/it, he/it should teach them Czech. 
" You/they believed, if they came home, that would become them Czech to fits comes ", according to Chalupa. 
Nobody of the German war-prisoner, that had lived before the war in the Czechoslovakia, reckoned according to his/its opinion with it that they would expel him/it on the basis of the Bene?-Dekrete from the republic. 
You don't think - then pays! 
An emotion-loaded campaign directs to motorists 
Most expensive action to the security on the streets in the Czech history. 
Also so, the emotion-loaded media-campaign, that wants to start the traffic-ministry on Wednesday, could be characterized. 
The authority of Minister Ale? ?ebí?ek makes a slip of the tongue from it to discourage drivers of dangerous behavior behind the steering wheel. 
The campaign for 150 million crowns becomes in the television, in the radio, in the cinema, in the Internet, but also on Flyern runs. 
She/it shall the drivers from to fast Fahrweise and alcohol at the wheel discourages. 
And they also at it remind, itself before departure to angurten. 
The campaign wants above all young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and doesn't finally speak also occupation-drivers into the conscience. 
And something is shown in the spots? 
Above all histories of people, that appeal to emotions. 
Also the " bloody " slogan of the whole campaign testifies: 
You don't think - then pays! 
The words " doesn't think stands in capital letters on a mark-sign. 
And the word " stands in a blood-puddle then pays ". 
This should mean that one can pay a moment to inattentiveness with the own life. 
The spots will shock " the spectators until 2010 ". 
The ministry could be inspired from similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries where one can see pictures with drastic receptions of casualties quite normally. 
It makes a slip of the tongue that the accident-numbers and the number of the traffic-dead person sink to the Czech streets so. 
The spots became agency from that Euro RSCG composed. 
Sugar-bread and whip for the motorists 
" To the drivers, the motto is applied sugar-bread and whip. 
Sugar-bread means that she/it, if they drive with red for example, time saves. 
The whip is the threat of a penalty or an accident then. 
The driver must be reminded of the risk, according to the traffic-psychologist of the hospital well Homolce Martin Ko?án. 
And therefore information-campaigns are in the press and above all negative advertisement necessary, the psychologist thinks. 
Is of his/its opinion already less effective after blackboards, that the drivers alert to a danger. 
One " put a static blackboard, that warns of a danger, on will flow away these with the surroundings probably soon, and the drivers will perceive " her/it/them no longer, Ko?án thinks. 
Olmert would become almost all busy areas in the exchange for peace returns 
The chairperson of the provisional Israeli government of Ehud Olmert has voiced agreement with the return all areas, that were occupied 1967, practically, therefore also the Jordan-country, Ostjerusalem and the Golan-Höhen, if one could lock peace with Palestine and Syria into the exchange for it. 
He/it emphasized this in an interview, that was printed Jediot Achronot on Monday of the daily. 
" We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that it becomes necessary, almost all busy areas, to return, if not even all ", Olmert said opposite the newspaper. 
" We keep a certain percentage of these areas, however we will have to transfer a similarly high percentage (Israeli area) at the Palestinians, because there will be no peace without this, he/it added. 
He/it admitted that a possible return will include also Ostjerusalem. 
" The one, that wants security in Jerusalem and doesn't want in particular, that tractors or bulldozers roll over his/its legs, how it has happened to one of my best friends, will have to " to give up a part of Jerusalem, noticed Olmert in allusion to two attacks in the city in July, with which several people killed and were injured persons dozen. 
After words of the premier, it will be necessary, a " special-solution for him/it temple-Bern and sanctifies and to find historic places ", that lie the old part of town on the territory. 
" The one, that wants to get the Israeli sovereignty over the entire city up, will have to integrate 270.000 Arabs. 
That won't work ", he/it confirmed further. 
Departure of the Golan-Höhens 
Olmert voiced agreement with a departure of Israel of the Golan-Höhens what is an indisputable condition according to his/its opinion for the conclusion of a peace-contract with Syria. 
This would necessitate however also certain efforts on sides of Damascus. 
" My suggestion is not to close " solely with Syria on the basis of a departure of the Golan-Höhen peace, confirmed Olmert. 
" The Syriers know only all too well they must give up what in order to get back the Golan-Höhen. 
You/they will have to give up her/its/their present relationship to the Iran; she/it will have to give up her/its/their relationship to the Shiite Hisbollah-Bewegung; she/it will have to give up the continuous support, that she/it the terrorism of the Shiite Hamas-Bewegung, the terror-network Al-Khaida and the Dschihad, the sacred war, in the Iraq grants ", the premier concretised. 
Questions after the accident: Are stewards unlawful in the bus? 
The law doesn't know her/it/them, in a long-distance travel-bus, the Umherlaufen is allowed not 
In the context with the tragic accident of a bus of the society of student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question poses itself, whether stewards and travelers during the trip in the bus - and herlaufens are allowed to. 
We " wanted strictly and keep the law formally, so the activity of a steward stands in the contradiction by the law over the traffic ", according to the speaker of the traffic-ministry Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, with which last week died a twenty-two-year old stewardess, was probably caused by the driver of the truck, who crossed the bus the way. 
The young woman sat in this moment to all accident beside the driver, on the least certain place in the car, albeit she/it still had two wide places to the disposal. 
A bus can however also have an accident at the moment or keenly can brake in which the steward delivers coffee or newspapers. 
A role also plays whether the bus is equiped according to the vehicle-letter also with standing-rooms. 
If this is not intended in the bus, the travelers must sit. 
The long-distance travel-buses of student Agency have no standing-rooms; something the director of the company, Radim Jan?ura, opposite Aktuáln? .cz confirmed. 
We have discussed " this with the ministry, and this has not first agreed to the movement of travelers. 
Later one has taken back this, and we have reached a consensus, after which the travelers can go during the trip on the toilet, if they have " her/its/their seat, he/it communicated his/its point of view. 
The law knows no steward 
There is no unambiguous legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legal-rule describes this role. 
There is however also no legal-rule, that it prohibits the carrier, to produce services. 
The law over the traffic knows only the concept vehicle-companion; his right and duties doesn't define it however, the speaker of the ministry adds Hanzelka unequivocally. 
The director of the department street-vehicles of the traffic-ministry Josef Pokorný however it thinks that the law covers this problem late. 
" It depends on it whether the bus in the product-admission has also standing-rooms. 
That is everything " then, he/it emphasizes. 
Buses subdivide themselves into city-buses where there are standing-rooms and is limited the maximum speed, local traffic-buses with standing-rooms and a higher allowed speed and long-distance travel-buses without standing-rooms with the highest allowable speed and seats that are equiped with safety belts. 
Like in the airplane, the expert says 
The BESIP-Fachmann for roadworthiness Jaroslav Ho?ín sees no basic problem in the movement of stewards of a bus on board. 
" With a liquid Fahrweise, many dangers don't threaten, the situation is comparable with the service of an airplane on board. 
Also here is not sure, when turbulences come, and the stewardess can bump " the head. 
If you " brake a bus however keenly, of course also the laws of the physics are valid then. 
Equally like in the city-bus or in a streetcar. 
The security of the stewards must clarify " the carrier through internal rules, he/it says and also thinks that this problem is not removed completely from the view of the law. 
Jan?ura is ready to cancel the services 
Student Agency offers as single Busfirma services of stewards. 
The company employs approximately two hundred persons in this function. 
The director doesn't regard her/its/their occupation also after the accident as risk-pregnant. 
" As soon as receives the impression I however, that the occupation of the steward is risk-pregnant, I will cancel him/it. 
Coffee and newspapers can get the travelers when getting on. 
That would lower " also the expenses, he/it thinks. 
As interest in the security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the absence of stewards in its bus. His/its society drives however only one fraction of lines in the comparison with student Agency. 
" We have no stewardesses, we fight against it already from the beginning. 
Earlier or later this finishes with any deadly accident ", he/it had expressed not completely one year ago for Týden.cz. 
That was an unbelievable tragedy 
With the accident of a public bus to Naples, a young stewardess had had an accident from the region of Pilsen, that had worked two years for the society. 
The Slovenian TRUCK was turned without probably blinking from the stand-strip and had obstructed the bus the trip. 
The driver of the bus tried to avoid through a sharp maneuver, collided with the right front part with the TRUCK however. 
That the two places have been sold for the stewards, Jan?ura disputes. 
" These places cannot be reserved with long-distance-connections, they are blockaded ". 
Company wants to sue truckers. 
With a compensation for the family of the young woman, the agency won't wait for the judgment, she/it expects a financial damages however also from sides of the guilty. 
A law-It-alteration? 
Not in view 
A more exact regulation of the movement of stewards of a bus on board could bring a lawful regulation, on which a thirty-headed expert-team of the traffic-ministry already works over one year. 
" This however has still reached to no concrete end. 
Buses don't necessarily stand on the agenda, rather the point-system, the maximum speed on the highway also and the application of Handys with the trip ", according to expert Ho?ín. 
" The traffic-ministry doesn't consider the activity of the stewards something, that could essentially endanger the security of the traveler, according to Hanzelka, with which the control of the security of the buses lies in the area of authority the police and the work-protection-authorities. 
Düsseldorfer hopes rest on Frankfurt 
Of big words, there is not a lack in the letter of the WestLB-Vorstands at the co-workers of the house. 
Through a brings together of units of the Düsseldorfer money-institute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, the central capital-market-house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe " could originate, it is called in the become letter known on Monday. 
The WestLB would bring in one " area of authority-block " with lasting profit-strength into such a business. 
And at all such a connection could be the crucial impulse for further Bündelungen in the Landesbankensektor. 
So it reads itself if an executive in difficult time wants to demonstrate action-ability. 
Because the weakened WestLB takes second place under huge pressure. 
Not only on the part of the EC-commission but also through the Federal-institution for finance-service-supervision, that has made clear the North Rhine-Westphalian government first recently, the time, to find a future-solution, pushes. 
From one as always gearteten connection between the Deka-Bank, the savings bank-customers because of her/its/their investment-funds know, and the WestLB is however already since some time the speech - also on Frankfurt side. 
Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas has had admittedly known the Halbjahreszahlen tail of August with the presentation, in an amalgamation of the house at the Mainzer country road with a regional bank, approximately the Helaba or the WestLB, sees no sense he/it. 
However, the administrative council of the Deka, that is ever carried by the regional banks and the savings bank-associations half, has engaged the executive, with which to lead WestLB conversations across common business-activities. 
It could walk around the capital-market-business or parts of it. 
The conversations admittedly have, so it is called at the finance-place, just now begun. 
The speech is not from the Deka-Bank, that is with her/its/their 3000 co-workers among the more important employers at the finance-place Frankfurt, for the first time if it is about consolidation in the savings bank-sector. 
2003, it looked a moment long so as the Deka-Bank could amalgamate Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba with the regional bank. 
This threesome-association turned into nothing however. 
Hardly the plans had become public, the Hessian government voiced disagreement with a participation of the Helaba at it. 
Also the two other houses didn't find thereupon to each other. 
The regional bank Rhineland-Palatinate went Baden-Württemberg at the regional bank in Stuttgart instead. 
However, there have been thought-games over a connection of the Deka-Bank with regional banks again and again. 
Finally, Günther Merl, executive-chairperson of the Helaba, had had a heart to heart talk against plan-games over an uniting with his/its house however. 
Independently from it the realization seems too ripe however that a moving closer of the different houses of the legal sector toots need. 
After the state parliament-election is now in Bavaria past, a connection of the BayernLB could sewer-move Baden-Württemberg as first with the regional bank. 
For the Helaba, that necessarily is not a good message. 
If the pressure should climb to further amalgamations, the partners follow her/it/them for it from. 
In the south, she/it would be a nurmehr junior-partner, although they stood the finance-crisis until now far better has as the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
One uniting with the west LB on the other hand has put forward Hesse-Thuringia, that is involved with 85 percent at the Helaba, the savings banks - and giro-association beginning of the year a bolt. 
She/it would remain if need be North LB. 
Such geostrategischen considerations are however only the one side. 
It is on the other about the question, fit like the different business-models of the individual houses to each other. 
In June, Merl, the crucial question, expressed the future-ability of the regional banks should be guaranteed with which business-model, it has not been answered by the German savings banks - and giro-association until now. 
In the end, also a Zerlegung could stand the west LB, that is not wished there naturally however. 
So the speech is also in the letter of the local executive dated it then, it is striven for a " total-solution " for the house in any case. 
Like that with the unites of individual units with the Deka-Bank under a hat has brought, will still appear. 
The second Wiesnwochenende is known as " Italian-weekend " 
For Elena, it is the first, for Luca already the third or fourth time. 
However this time is Elena as his/its friend with with it, and all different is so, he/it says. 
A massively built more bearded stands behind them, with the five-liter-barrel of beer of the brand emperors, and which low note his/its throat can produce proves the approximately 200 Oktoberfest-travelers. 
Elena gives Luca first a spank, then a kiss. 
From Bologna, they have come after Verona. 
From here, that Busparkplatz beside the railway station Puorta Nuova, four buses, " destinazione Monaco, festa della birra ", arrival probably start in this evening at 23.45 o'clock 6.30 o'clock. 
Three buses are above all the Italienern reservations, exclusively Brazilians travel in a bus. 
In a corner of the parking place, the South Americans already sing beside her/its/their flag, they have already celebrated in the night. 
And so loud, Marco Guarda says, that is nothing for Italian. 
Marcos, that carry a long coat with Pelzimitatfutter and a pair of glasses with wide silvery clips, belong the buses. 
For five years, they have driven to the Oktoberfest, three tours are it in this year alone. 
At night, during the day on the Wiesn, at 22.30 o'clock back. 
Would sleep only unnecessary expenses means, Marco says. 
75 Euro costs the trip, the welcome-communal drink with emperor-beer, brewed true to the Bavarian purity law, the health insurance and the German-language trip-management - Marco has visited a language-course in Frankfurt - including. 
And already the buses roll into the night, on which Autostrada direction " Brennero ". 
There is no beer, not yet. 
Quickly it becomes quietly in the bus, the travelers sleep. 
Well so, they will still need her/its/their strengths. 
One holds in Brixen and in wood-churches where also several other buses put in with Italian marks at the highway 8 before Munich a pause once again shortly. 
As Marcos group finally arrives scheduled at half seven o'clock in the dawn on the parking place close to the Theresienwiese, already stands there at the 50 others bus from whole Europe. 
Elena, Lucas and the others collect themselves, Marco gives a last address, explains the attack-plan. 
Firstly: The yellow cutting ettes lands. 
Stands left of " Oktoberfest ", in fracture, beside it the Internetadresse of Marcos travel agency,: conoscersiviaggiando.it ". 
Secondly: " If the doors rise to the beer tent, it is called runs "!, Marco calls in in the morning. 
" Run "! The places in the rear part of the tent run and occupy. 
" Not in the front, otherwise we, and not all yellow-caps on the same benches, blockade in the area distributes "! 
The stein, Marco yells, caresses 8,25 Euro. 
And tip doesn't forget. 
It shows " the security-people that we behave well! 
As soon as you leave the places, they are away "! 
Thirdly: " Today evening point half eleven again here appears "! Understood? 
And already it goes to the Wiesn. 
Binds one yellow cover as Wegmarken at the trees on the way, at signs and even at the election-poster of a big Bavarian people-party. 
One wants braced for the retreat. 
It is the second Wiesnwochenende, as " Italian-weekend " known. 
There are not exact statements over numbers; the speech is ten percent of all visitors should have arrived at this weekend from Italy extra from 50 000, that do itself on the way over the Alps and occur into the beer tents. 
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police from South-Tyrol, Italian voluntary helpers support the Bavarian red cross, that leads a Nationenstatistik, in which the Italians before British (approximately 60 uses) and Austrians (approximately 80) with approximately 200 medical cares the first place covers. 
Likes with Italienern particularly the Hofbräuzelt is. 
Sleepless nights for believer that hypo actually Estate 
The German Bankensystem is relatively stable, emphasized Federal-finance-ministers peer Steinbrück only in the violated week. 
How good, that the politician would use the word " relatively " and as well einflocht, that the German Bankensektor of the crisis-like developments is not spared. 
Because that has only happened at the weekend. 
That in the Dax actually wrote down to Munich Immobilienfinanzierer Hypo Estate (HRE) gets a billion-credit from a consortium of German banks in order to shield itself/themselves from the turbulences at the markets. 
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday, the credit-helps amounted on up to 35 billions Euro. 
That hypo actually Estate must pay interest on only the part, that she/it takes also in claim. 
The money comes as well as from private like also legal banks. 
Losses are background with the daughter Depfa. 
The Staatsfinanzierer had refinanced itself according to a newspaper-report for long-period-projects, for which he/it has lent money, - because of what of the mistrust at the markets meanwhile no longer possible is. 
In the first half-year 2008 was the Barreserve of the bank about 95 percent on 2,37 millions Euro shrunk, also the personal capital-quota had given in easily from 1,6 on 1,45 percent. 
The current profits and the net-profits from finance-businesses had fallen opposite the Vorjahreszeitraum on zero, the profits from attributions to demands and certain investments as well as from the dissolution of reserves in the credit-business about more than 70 percent on 5 millions Euro sunk. 
Only thanks to higher profits from reimbursements of nachgelagerten settlement-expenses from the restructuring of the former Depfa-Gruppe as well as from the reimbursement of interests after the depositing-order and from the business-purchase for concern-businesses, the profit-deficit had let are still cancelled moderately with approximately 16 percent. 
That formerly Staatsfinanzierer first had itself after his/its denationalization in the year 1990 with industrial real estate-credits verspekuliert, that had been separated in the Aareal bank then. 
Because one in the classic state-funding too little deserved, the Depfa had increased engaged in infrastructure-projects and the funding of community-projects of private investors and the state then, Private-Public-Partnership (PPP) and internationally diversifizierrt. 
On the value of the daughter, that must hypo actually Estate now deductions, that will have a " essential material effect " on the profit - and loss calculation of the group, plans it is called quite uncertainly. 
Fact is that the dividend was canceled. 
Already for 2007, she/it had been shortened about two third. 
That hypo actually Estate is since the Depfa-Übernahme an important state - and Infrastrukturfinanzierer. 
She/it is dependent stronger than other institutes on the refinancing at the Interbankenmarkt since she/it has no tidings-no-situations. 
With the breakdown of the American investment-bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago it has dried up the credit-award under the banks again largely since the banks hoard her/its/their liquidity. 
That hypo actually Estate needs annually for a part - approximately 50 billions Euro - the Kreditportfolios of the Depfa short-term methods to the refinancing. 
After communication that hypo actually Estate, the funding-demand of the group is met with the credit on foreseeable time and shielded the business " of the influence the international money-mart " largely inable to function at present. 
From other sources, it is to be heard that the refinancing is secured thanks to the moneys until end of 2009. 
The HRE-Vorstandsvorsitzende Georg spark explained, against it that that hypo actually Estate Group the money-markets on foreseeable time will have to take in claim no longer. 
Federal-bank and the Federal-institution for finance-service-supervision (BaFin) assume it that the marketability of that hypo actually Estate group only is secured. 
That stands to hope for stockholders and creditors of the bank. 
But in view of the dynamics and imponderabilities of the crisis, there is probably no certainty. 
It even is not unthinkable that the funding must not be taken in full scope in claim. 
But also the opposite is not to ausschleißen. 
After the bank still stood on the late Sunday evening according to hearing in front of the insolvency, also the at least temporary rescue is not able to calm down the natures. 
The share price breaks about 75 percent on 3,30 Euro one. 
Quite well, the bond-courses last against it. 
The priority debts hardly last themselves moved shows, the courses of the Nachrang-Anleihen more clearly give in. 
Above all the bonds of the former subsidiary are concerned Württemberg hypo and understandably the over 2009 outgoing terms. 
Appearances Hypo-Real-Estate-Anleihen formerly a speculative installation-alternative, so their value-containing-ness must after the clear increase of the Bankenkrise and the institute itself that had only gotten itself the crisis with the takeover of the Depfa into the house, as is viewed by the stability of the international financial system dependent. 
As long as the music-banks, governments and less weakened commercial banks are still ready to the reinforcement of the system, as long as can be gone out by a timely satisfaction of the pensions. 
Or however it it kicks that one, which hardly still hoping somebody at present dares, - that the finance-crisis is overcome in the coming 15 months. 
However in view of that itself with the part-nationalization skipping news has become only a justifiable hope from the likelihood bordering at security at present. 
That should make ready above all long-time-creditors some sleepless nights with the decision whether they should part with her/its/their commitments. 
Short-time-investors can use a Schlussstrich for it after all to form a loss-lecture for the future discharge-tax-payments on profits of later years. 
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box 
As should introduce Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, itself at the first schoolday at the Tachibana Highschool, the girls start to giggle: The German is kawaii " totally "! 
What the means? 
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange-log tells her/it/them from Japan. 
" The first schoolday in Japan. 
I was excited. 
Already before the school-way, I had jitters. 
I live at the edge of Tokyo in direction Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to the Tachibana Highschool. 
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I have not gotten lost. 
The instruction-beginning doesn't seem at the Tachibana as strictly as fixed with us in Lower Saxony at home. 
The students trudeln from eight o'clock one, until a short discussion-round begins about twenty before nine with the teacher, that ' home room'. 
However before the instruction began, I was next to introduce me. 
I am still the type, that likes to speak in front of people, with it to it before a class of 40 students not at all. 
Because I still had no school-uniform, I have put on an old skirt of my guest-mother, to it blouse, blue stockings and black leather-shoes. 
In this elevator, I have therefore placed myself in front of the desk and have tried to pronounce everything right: ' Sayonara Wo she Sylvana... ' - I hot Sylvana, comes from Germany and has birthday in a week. 
At the moment I was very glad that I had already started to learn the language well two years ago. 
The 31 girls in the class have whispered all, giggled and gewunken and continuously I have heard the word " Kawaii ". 
I already knew that from my Mangases. 
It belongs to the survive-important vocabulary of Japanese girls and means ' cute, süß'. 
Then, I have scurried quickly on my place. 
The girl beside me has grinned rather broadly, she/it found it a honor that the exchange-schoolgirl should sit beside her/it/them. 
The rest of the hour was rather quiet, sounded however as the gong, I was stormed downright. 
All spoke in confusion and giggled and asked me holes into the stomach - with it is it really heavy to understand Japanese English. 
All her/its/their Bentos unpacked in the pause then. 
My guest-mother had made also such a Lunchbox for me - that is something else than the desolate German trace-breads once. 
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a type meat in the Tofumantel. 
Usually I have no pale glimmer what exactly I eat here in Japan. 
The things look strangly and taste good completely new. 
Solidly it stands that everything is really more delicious. 
Naja, until on the salty inlaid plums maybe, brrrr! 
The Bentoses are simply lunches at Japanese schools not only. 
It sometimes occurs that a girl gives a boy an even prepared Bento, that she/it dresses especially skillfully then, - in the hope, to know the boy with the Pausensnack near, to learn. 
I have read from it in my Manga-Comics. 
I am once tense whether I can also observe that here. 
' Why then especially Japan? ', have my friends asked me as I told them that I want to go for one year in Tokyo to the school. 
I have always said then: 
" Because it simply fascinates " me. 
Finally, I read Mangas already for years the most dearly. 
And with it I the comics and the culture in it better understands, I have also started someday to learn a little Japanese. 
It was therefore completely clear for me that I had to travel here someday. 
Because I have also a weakness for tradition, manners and customs. 
And one puts big value on them/her/it here. 
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the newest technologies and trends - on the other side is strict it, disciplines and traditional. 
And because all so well is organized, I have not lost felt here as well even if Tokyo is the biggest city, that I have ever seen. 
Also rats have feelings 
A rat or a scrapes flees with danger, that is called that she/it feels also fear? 
The neuro-scientist Joseph LeDoux is confident: Also many animals have feelings. 
Only like could check one whether they feel the same, if she/it itself like like we holds back? 
In the Internetzeitschrift " Edge " becomes since publishes several years of contributions of famous scientists. 
MIRROR presented selected answers in a series on the question " something ONLINE, you consider true without being able to prove it? 
I believe that animals have sensations and other Bewusstseinszustände without I or someone could prove this until now otherwise where we can prove not once that other people have consciousness. 
But we can hope in this case at least since all human brains show the same reason-configuration. 
As soon as we turn however other species to us and questions of the feels or quite broadly the consciousness broaches, we enter rough terrain because the hardware doesn't agree. 
If a rat gets in danger, she/it toots the same as many other animals: She/it places herself/itself dead, escapes or attacks. 
People behave similarly. 
I don't believe in it however. 
Two aspects the brain-structure make it difficult, our subjective experiencing on that of animals too figurative. 
To the one, that almost always lock up with the human consciousness associated circuitries the lateral präfrontalen Cortex, because of his/its participation at the short-time-memory and at the Ausführungs - / control-functions. 
This wide region is much higher than with the remaining primates developed with the human being and seems fully to be missing with other creatures. 
At least with those aspects of our consciousness, that depend on the präfrontalen Cortex, under it the knowledge, whoever are we, and the ability too flat and, to adjudicate, reason therefore exists to the assumption that the human being even differs from the other primates. 
Another dramatic peculiarity should lie in the linguistic nature of the human being: Since a so big part is interconnected his experience with language, it is called often, the consciousness depends on it. 
In this case, they could exclude animals. 
However even if consciousness would not depend on language, this would influence it certain, sodass itself animal consciousness, probably very much from most of our Bewusstseins-zustände how it may also be obtained, would distinguish. 
Therefore it is heavy to determine as consciousness may look with other animals. 
If it itself, as something internal and subjective, neither measures still, because of the particular hardware, on the basis of our own experience has analyzed, so his/its exploration places us in front of big problems. 
Most of my implementations refer to the content of the conscious sees, however there is still another aspect of the consciousness beside it, the scientifically more simply accessible should be. 
They could examine the Bewusstseinsprozesse of animals regardless of her/its/their contents, and exactly that happens with studies over the short-time-memory of primates, especially at the example of the Visualisierung. 
However with this base, that Christof cook and Francis Crick pursued, one resorts rather on the neuralen correlate of the consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: Both may be identically or also not. 
This base emphasizes interesting-proof also the meaning of the präfrontalen Cortex for the realization of the Visualisierung. 
What now emerges for the sensations? 
I attribute her/it/them to it that an emotional system is activated like the brain agreed the fear in one of his/its own activity. 
For what we call fear ", the mentale condition, in which we are, is therefore if the activity the in the brain of localized defense-system or their consequences (like physical reactions) RAM covers. 
So about sensations are taken a narrow view bound at the regions of the Cortex, the primates and especially the individual mark. 
Connected emerged fine gradations of the feels with the linguistic nature, because we differentiate with help the words and the grammar conditions and can categorize in order to attribute her/it/them also to others beside us. 
In contrast Antonio Damasio thinks for example that sensations follow from more primitive activities in the body-feeling-regions of the Cortex and the brain-trunk Jaak Pankseep, that concentrates on the brain-trunk however more, similarly. 
Since this network has not changed in the sprint of the human evolution very much, it could absolutely be involved sensations at gattungsübergreifenden. 
Purely theoretically I cannot disagree with him/it, it considers unverifiable however. 
Pankseep argues, what appears with rats and people like fear, feels probably also in both cases so: How however could one check whether rats and people feel the same if they behave similarly? 
One scrape flees with danger whether also she/it feels fear? 
In my eyes, bare behavior-similarity can still prove no experience-equality. 
Admittedly, the neurale comparison helps: Rats and people have similar brain-trunks, scraping against it not even one brain. 
But the brain-trunk is responsible for sensations? 
And even if they could prove that for the human being: How wanted they to prove it with rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even scrape, who knows, sensations have. 
But I would not know as I should prove that. 
And because presumably fundamentally itself her/its/their sensations from that our it distinguishes since the human consciousness is founded on particular circuits and on language, I rather explore the emotional behavior as the emotional sensations of rats. 
Anyway advances wave here on the neuralen level provided one measures the same with rats and people. 
As I don't explore language and consciousness with rats, so also not sensations, I don't know however whether they exist. 
One may consider that short-sighted, but I come rather in front than to run continuous against a wall. 
I am just a practical Emotionalist. 
Uefa-Präsident Platini: Reprieve for Poland and Ukraine 
The acting premier Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations would be put under the direct responsibility of president and premiers soon. 
" The government sees the decision of the Uefa in Bordeaux as trust-proof into the Ukraine and her/its/their ability, that to organize " EM together with Poland, Wasjunik said. 
" That is no amnesty for our country however. 
The work has just now begun and there is to do " even much in both countries. 
In the schedule for the construction or rebuilding of the stages, streets, hotels and airports limp the two hosts after. 
Possibly, even the number of the EM-Stadien of eight is reduced to six. 
" We can waste no time more. 
We must now work " with maximum speed, the Ukrainian Verbands-Präsident Grigorij Surkis said. 
" The UEFA is kept " us in the eye steadily. 
An even more radical step was decided in Poland. 
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN is suspended after numerous scandals of the national Olympic committee and been replaced with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki. 
The commission had met on inquiry of sport-minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
It survives " the serious danger, that the PZPN is not capable to deal " after the rules, Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP said. 
" We have assured Uefa-Präsident Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation won't suffer on the EM 2012 from it. 
Several Erstligistens were alone in because of the bygone season manipulation to the compulsory-descent been condemned, even the league-start had to finally be postponed for a short time. 
Indignant Dennis Quaid hits back 
She/it wanted a new film promoten, spoke in the interview over private - and now has anger with him/it ex: Hollywood-star Meg Ryan outete her/its/their Verflossenen away Dennis Quaid as adulterers. 
He/it foams - and hits back. 
Delayed rose-war with the ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: The two Hollywood-actors now deliver strainers year after her/its/their divorce an unsightly dispute together - in all public. 
Meg Ryan was closed itself in an interview with the US-Zeitschrift InStyle last week for the first time the the reasons for the failure of the marriage expressed: " Dennis was me disloyal long time, and that was very painful ". 
The size of the deceit has only brought her/it/them after the divorce in experience. 
Leave on for the soul-striptease, Ryans press-work was for her/its/their new film " The Women " - is told the history of an adultery. 
Dennis Quaids reaction on his/its Outing as disloyal husband was clearly cancelled: It is monstrous ", the 54-year old of the " New Daily said News " that " Meg to the repeated time ruminates the history of our relationship and umdichtet ". 
It is moreover " regrettable " that the common 16-year old son Jack renews " publicly is reminded at the pain and the revolutions that means " a divorce for each child. 
During Ryan since the divorce alone lives, Quaid is married again and became father of twins lately. 
And so closes his/its defenses with the side swipe: " My life continues anyway. 
I estimate myself happily that I have a wonderful family, that goes " it very well. 
Prices for flight-tickets and hotels sink 
In the first half of the year 2008, flights and overnight stays were cheaper than in the previous year in Europe. 
In Germany, flights even became cheaper according to a current study up to 50 percent. 
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become more favorable again - that is the result of a study of the rice - and Finanzdienstleisters American express. 
The business has analyzed his/its booking-data from the first half-year 2008 and has determined a clear break-in in the second quarter after an uprising of the prices in the first quarter. 
After the prices have climbed on the hotel-market for years, the overnight stays have already reduced in price in many places. 
From January until March, the prices still climbed in 41 of 48 examined European cities on average about 6,9 percent in the comparison to 2007. 
From April until June, the prices were however already lower than in the previous year about 3,6 percent. 
The trend has been the clearest in Paris and Rome where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent before less than one year. 
As cause for it, American express sees the weak dollar-course, that has led to a " waning trip-desire of American tourists ". 
Also, finance-places are more strongly than industry-locations involved like Frankfurt or London from the decline of the hotel-prices like Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger. 
In the Norwegian city, the hotel-prices hold even the record in Europe with an increase of 26,3 percent. 
Also with the air fares, the trend still showed in the first quarter upward: 
Travelers had to pay 7,1 percent because of the Kerosinverteuerung in the economy class in the cut more than 2007, fuel-intensive long distance flights even became more expensive up to 29,2 percent. 
From April until June, the prices sank for flight-tickets of the economy class on average about 12,5 percent in the comparison to the preceding quarter, in the business - and First-Class, the price-changes were however far more inferior. 
The prices broke even more strongly in Germany an as in other European countries: 
From January until March, the prices had risen by 11,9 percent, in the second quarter, they sank about 23,6 percent. 
On German inland-flights, the prices have even halved themselves according to the study. 
Reason for the price-break-in is the reducing economic growth on the one hand, the business explains. 
The demand in many segments of the flight-trip-market crumbles. 
On the other hand, there is an elevated competition-pressure through the Open-Skies-Abkommen, that liberalizes the air traffic between the USA and Europe. 
Sign the taut situation is unprofitabler the deletion routes with Airlines, just as the high number of the airlines, that would have announced 2008 failures in the first half-year, - in Europe alone was 24 airlines this. 
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0 
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburg SPORTS CLUB becomes leader. 
With the Borussia, Luhukay doesn't still succeed, an operating goblin, to find. 
From Kristoffer Klein increases crash-landing for national-player Marko Marin. 
The Gladbacher came into the game first late and failed with a lifter because of the slat. 
His/its message was precisely formulated, she/it was him/it beyond the lips convincingly. 
He/it simply knew that he/it had right. 
" We need the second gate ", Hermann Rieger hissed in the cubicle-walk of the Hamburg arena. 
Much was not free in the catacombs, the half-time-pause was finished and most sat on her/its/their places again. 
Rieger was virtually three decades physiotherapist of the HSV, he/it enjoys a higher prestige as some flowed away protagonist. 
And so his/its request found also hearing at responsible position. 
Assistenztrainer Cornelius Jol nodded and lifted the thumb agreeing. 
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's Boss-trainer Martin Jol. 
His command will have been similarly: With gate two! 
The transposition stayed away. 
" There everything was to be not looked at " today beautifully, Marcell Jansen admitted later. 
Also Bastian Reinhardt would have wished " it itself " more relaxed. 
The 1:0, 1:0, the Hamburg have the head-ball-hit of Mladen Petric to owe, 11.); and the circumstance, that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburg. 
" It was a dirty victory ", Martin Jol summarized. 
The Hamburg SPORTS CLUB becomes 121 years old on this Monday. 
The spectators even celebrated themselves in the Saturday-afternoon already once, the blue heaven over the arena and the lightning-table on the video-wall, that deported her/its/their club as Klassenprimus. 
It will become a birthday without real party. 
" We know to classify " that, Marcell Jansen said. 
He/it suspects that the tabular inter-certificate stands for the unpredictability of the league more, as for the Dominanz of his/its HSV. 
The team with her/its/their accesses indebted late - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, that scorers Petric as well as the Jansen enticed away by the FC Bavaria - is admittedly located slowly to shine she/it is not yet able however. 
" We need more flair and more Dribblings ", Jol demanded. 
After the vote-defeat 
The fear spreads at the embankment of Street. 
First news of the failure of the rescue-package let the Dow Jones break in about 700 points at times. 
That was the biggest point-loss within one day in his/its history. 
Later, the Dow caught itself something again. 
Against 20:30 o'clock, the stock exchange-barometer most important world-wide wrote down with well five percent in the deficit with 10.579 counters. 
The technology-stock exchange of Nasdaq lay with more than seven percent in the deficit with 1548 points. 
Biggest loser was to this time in the Dow American express that barely 14 percent lost and the bank of America with a loss of approximately twelve percent. 
No title could to hingewinnen. 
The shares of the bank of Goldman Sachs gave in about barely ten percent. 
Few days only ago, Big-investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the business. 
In the framework of the rescue-plan, the methods should be prepared for the buys up of so-called lazy hypo-bar-papers. 
The sum should not be disbursed on a hit however but step-by-step. 
As a countermove, the state should get share-option-appearances of the finance-societies, that could be cashed with corresponding course-development, in order to reduce the burden for the treasury. 
Share prices in Europe and USA in the downward-suction 
The billion-helps for banks in Europe and in the USA don't remedy the doubts of the investors. 
The share price of the German big-bank hypo actually Estate falls and tears the Dax downward. 
The US-Index Dow Jones loses despite the planned rescue of the finance-market through the state. 
Spectacular losses that hypo actually Estate and the Commerzbank has torn the German share-index (Dax) into the deficit deeply. 
The share of the Munich real estate-financier lost three quarters of her/its/their value, that Commerzbank gave, about more than 20 percent despite the rescue-action of Federal government and private-banks at times after. 
The Dax slid under the psychological important 6000-Punkte-Marke plainly and wrote down with a deficit of 3,7 percent with 5.839 points. 
World-wide, the stock markets went into the knees. 
In New York, that revealed embankment Street with clear losses. 
Investors were afraid that heavy rescue-package of the US-Regierung could be not sufficient the 700 billion dollar in order to bring the finance-markets in energy again. 
The Dow lost 334 points or 3,3 percent on 10.809,25 points in the first trade-hour. 
The US-Repräsentantenhaus wanted to vote on the rescue-plan, the vote in the senate could at the 1. Octobers follow. 
Also the other European stock exchanges knew only one direction: In London, the FTSE-Index first gave in about 3,2 percent that CAC lost 40 in Paris 2,9 percent. 
In Asia, the Japanese Leitindex Nikkei fell after initially-profits about 1,26 percent on 11.743,61 counters. 
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng-Index slid about 2,1 percent on 18.286,90 points. 
In India, the Leitindex Sensex lost 506,43 points or 3,9 percent and closed with 12.595.75 counters. 
In the MDax, shares of Arcandor gave in to a capital-increase after the announcement. 
The private-bank Sal. Oppenheim has drawn the 23 million new shares. 
The trade - and tourism-concern gave furthermore known that the shares are not sold to Thomas Cook. 
Dark matter influences flight of area-probes 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon provides helplessness when searching: Dark matter influences the speed of area-probes during so named Swing-by-Manöver. 
Experts are afraid that Albert Einsteins general relativity-theory could not be quite right. 
Almost 18 years, the area-probe " flew Ulysses " through the space. 
Because of fuel-managements freezing soon, you now threaten the hypothermia. 
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon provides bewilderment for years - the Swing-by-Anomalie. 
The Swing-by is a flight-maneuver of area-probes, with which they get additional energy in the gravitational-field of a heavenly body, approximately the earth. 
The probes can save much fuel through it. 
The European-American research-probe of Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick like the sunbathe-probe Ulysses as well. 
What astonishes the researchers with it however already for years: The missiles don't behave 100-percent so as they would expect it according to the time-honored gravitational-law. 
Rather, irregularities occur in the speed. 
The probes become unexpectedly more quickly or slow. 
Up to now, the physicists could not explain this effect. 
You/they baptized him/it Swing-by-Anomalie. 
Some experts are afraid that possibly even Albert Einsteins general relativity-theory, that describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of the area, could not be quite right. 
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the institute for Advanced Study from Princeton it still believes solidly that Einstein didn't wander, and tries to explain the Swing-by-Anomalie with the help of the so-called dark matter, the astronomers in the universe has amounted. 
" Responsibly for the anomaly, dark matter, that could also be completely near the earth, could be he/it writes. 
About the existence of the dark matter, the space-researchers have known only for approximately ten years. 
An attraction, whose effect has observed itself on other heavenly bodies, assumes her/it/them obviously. 
She/it itself is however completely invisible, that is, she/it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially just also no visible light. 
After the calculations of the scientists, the dark matter amounts after all well one fifth of the entire mass of the universe. 
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free 
After ten days in the hand of her/its/their abductors, the tourists carried off in Egypt should be free again as the Italian secretary of State confirmed. 
The abductors from the Sudan had several millions Euro ransom demanded. 
Six hostage-takers should have been killed at a shooting before the release. 
Five Germans have been abducted in the south of Egypt. 
Ransom-negotiations should already run. 
Again and again, Germans get into the visor of kidnappers. 
WORLD ONLINE portrays the most important cases. 
The European tourists carried off in the Sahara are apparently free. 
The Egyptian state-television, the Arabic TV-station Al-Arabija and Italian media reported this in accordance. 
The Italian secretary of State Franco Frattini confirmed the release after reports of the Italian television-station Sky TG 24: " Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have become relieved. 
We check exactly her/its/their health-condition ", Frattini said. 
The five German, five Italians and a Romanian as well as her/its/their eight Egyptian companions are well and in security, the Egyptian state-television reported. 
The 19 participants of a waste-expedition should already be on the way to Cairo. 
The backgrounds of a shooting remain unclear before the release of the hostages further: Therefore the abductors have been ready according to statements of an Egyptian security-official to the completion of the kidnapping before the Sudanese army killed six of the abductors surprising. 
" The problem was solved. 
You/they agreed with a ransom, the official said. 
It has only gone therefore to take " the hostages in reception as this surprise " came sudden ". 
Sudanese soldiers had shot on Sunday in the borderland between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt six of the abductors and had arrested two of them. 
The hostage-takers had a ransom in height of six millions from Germany Euro demanded; the money should be handed over one of the hostages by the German wife. 
The daily " El Masri El Jom " reported under appeal on a German mediator, the release of the hostages delays itself because the kidnappers feared for her/its/their security. 
According to the report, the abductors want to free the female hostages after payment of the ransom. 
The men should as long as is held on, until the abductors would have a certain escape-route. 
The German embassy in Cairo refused a comment to the report. 
Abuse the stepfather " led to the suicide " 
The more years-long abuse through her/its/their stepfather has led to it, that a woman has killed herself/itself, will inform a court. 
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, got an imprisonment of six years after he/it had confessed eight cases of sexual misuse. 
The criminal court-yard in Truro experienced that he/it bound his/its stepdaughter Stephanie Randle as she/it between five and seven years regularly as was. 
Trerise wrote in a confession: " I feel responsibly for her/its/their death ". 
The court experienced that itself woman Randle in her/its/their house in Mutley, Plymouth, at the 1. April 2007 in the age of 34 killed. 
As she/it lived as child in Coventry, Trerise had bound her/it/them and had connected her/its/their eyes before he/it enforced sexual actions, during her/its/their mother away, in order to work in a restaurant, was. 
Trerises and his/its wife could be parted in the 1980ern and he/it withdrew after Cornwall. 
His/its stepdaughter went after Plymouth. 
The court experienced however that woman Randle, that a big part of her/its/their time honorary for the national trust worked, from the misuse, that had been inflicted her/it/them two in the week times, was pursued. 
Prosecuting attorney Ramsay Quaife reported the court that friends would have said that woman Randle, who had been an eager surfer and cyclist, since has been emotionally dead " 2006 " and " would have given up " her/its/their life 
In April 2007, her/its/their right father found Terrance Randle her/it/them dead in her/its/their apartment in Plymouth. 
It is assumed that she/it has killed herself/itself in that has suffocated itself itself by means of a plastic-sack. 
Mr. Randle confronted the stepfather of his/its daughter, who wrote a confession-letter, that finished so,: " I was in the habit of binding her/it/them and to connect " her/its/their eyes. 
" I have not forced her/it/them sexually. 
I feel responsible " for her/its/their death. 
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: " You/they are an extremely strange fetishist and for her/its/their victim, it must have been terrifying, especially there she/it only seven was. 
This unpleasant history finishes with the suicide of the victim. 
The fact is more badly still that it is very unlikely that the issue would be finished before court if she/it had not done this. 
He/it added: " I take which effects, according to description of Stephanies father and mother, to the knowledge her/its/their action over the years on her/its/their daughter had. 
She/it would have been " a promising, successful and happy young woman otherwise unequivocally. 
Official responsible for lost data is accused 
The BBC has experienced that the cabinet-official, who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be accused in accordance with the " public security-law ". 
The man was delegated from the ministry of defense as he/it lost two extremely confidential documents in a train after Waterloo. 
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police. 
It is the weakest accusation within the law and there is no indication for criminal intent. 
BBC defense-correspondent Frank Gardner said the action has been a surprise for many in Whitehall. 
He/it said: " You/they would have thought that would be quarreled internally with it at the ministry of defense and cabinet. 
The employee, his names cannot be named, is accused in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause, that deals with the certain storage of information. 
The royal public prosecutor's office recommended that the official should be accused by the Metropolitan police of the extremely sensitive nature of his/its work in the common Geheimdienstkommitee. 
The documents, that he/it transferred, contained classified evaluations over Al-Quaida and the capacities of the Iraqi security forces. 
He/it was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was brought from his/its house at a secretly held place. 
Housing-societies see B&B expenses into the eye 
British housing-societies could stand bank after the rescue of the Brad-Ford and Bingley expenses of more than 80 million pounds into the house. 
The government made available 14 billion pounds, about the insoles of Brad-Ford & Bingleys of 2,6 million customers, to protect. 
The interests for this loan are paid by all businesses, that receive money of investors, including which 59 Baugesellschaftens 
The general director of the union of the housing-societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said, it is " unbearable " that the societies and her/its/their members had to would pay. 
One will pay back the 14 billion loan ultimately, if Brad-Ford & Bingleys credits is repaid. 
But with the interests amassed in the meantime are credited those 700 finance-businesses every year, the deposits assume. 
The program to the compensation of finance-services confirmed opposite the BBC that the 59 housing-societies are contained in this number. 
It is bitter that the institutions, that have behaved circumspect,... is now called to take on about some of the expenses of those institutions, that were far less circumspect. 
ADRIAN COLES, BSA, 
It said that each business had to would pay in the relationship to the insoles, that it would hold, and that the societies had to would pay together approximately 18% of the expenses. 
The department of Finance estimates that the interests are amounted for the credit to 450 million pounds in the year 2009. 
That is, that the societies of 81 million pounds must obtain for the interests of the first year. 
Adrian Coles, the general director of the union of the housing-societies, told the BBC that he/it believes that this is unfair. 
It is bitter that the institutions, that have behaved circumspect, are now called during the real estate-upswing to carry some of the expenses of those institutions, that were far less circumspect. 
According to the BSA, no society has failed since the existence of the records in the year 1945. 
" We become all aspects of this matter over the next weeks in order to see, which alternatives observe it in order to protect " housing-societies and her/its/their members of possibly considerable expenses gives. 
The interests, that become due in 2009, cover this of year the seven months of end of September until end of March. 
In the year 2010, interests become due for a full year and that could be nearly doubly as much. 
Since Baugesellschaftens are mutual organizations without partners, her/its/their members will have to either pay for the expenses through higher dues or lower interests on savings accounts. 
Milk becomes more expensive five pences per liter 
The people on Jersey see confront itself with it to have to pay for her/its/their milk more. 
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will lift the central market-price of his/its milk about wider five pence per liter from Monday on. 
It is the second price-increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes, after examinations of a Beratungsunternehmens were enforced. 
The retailers should adjudicate themselves whether they would like to relay the price-increase at her/its/their customers. 
Before the price-increase in February, the central market-price of Jersey finally changed milk in the year 2002.

The singer, the next week in London his/its particular golden price during the conferral will assume, said, he/it is honored to be acknowledged. 
The song, that lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was title-piece that to Meat Loafs hit-album from the year 1977. 
Coldplay " quotes the nominations for the price-award of this year after she/it has come in four categories into the narrower selection. 
The Chefredaktor of the magazine " Q magazine " Paul Rees said, there were some songs that exit over such Materien like time and genre and " are Out Of Hell " asked surely a from it. 
The song that was written by Jim Steinman, a powerful voice, that was delivered by Meat Loaf, necessitated. 
It begins with an instrumental part, that lasts almost two minutes. 
The song has appeared in Great Britain as single in the year 1979 in the sale and has reached place 15 in the Charts.

Obscure street in city, often forgets and, to sell possibly soon, 
New York city has thousands of rush-hour-streets, avenues, side streets and other bypasses, from which some famous and others only comfortable is. 
Nevertheless it is even to be said heavily for experienced taxi-drivers and long-time locals where extra is Place, simply, because most have never heard about it. 
This tiny street is in the east Village and gets lost Street direction north from the ridge between Bowery and Second avenue, without which to reach Second Street. 
She/it is 30 stems broadly and 120 stems long and looks sooner after a dusty alley than after an actively used pass-street. 
There are also no street-signs. 
It is practically impossible to find her/it/them on a Standard-Straßenplan. 
This street nevertheless has her/its/their admirers. 
For example, Avalon Bay, a Bauunternehmen, that has erected luxurious buildings on the ridge Street recently. 
It wants to pave extra Place again, around a clean pass to the stores and boutiques, that are expected in the new buildings, to manage. 
To the other admirers, the long-time neighborhood, that says, hears be she/it fascinated from the short alley simply because she/it is one of the remains of the past of the block. 
However the administration-department, that is responsible for protection and erection of the apartment houses and is responsible for the street, has no interest in it to get her/it/them. 
During a session of the committee for country-utilization of the district council in this month, representatives of the administration and Avalon have drafted Bay a suggestion for the purchase of the street through the Bauunternehmen. 
Nevertheless the committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and has asked after a new plan, that should be submitted in the coming month, according to Susan Stetzer, that Bezirksverantwortliche in the district council 3. 
" Only very little area has remained in the property of the city and we would like, that extra still hears " Place the city, she/it said. 
There could be offers, like one the street repairs and what of Avalon could be taken care of drives, however we also want that the public access remains " guaranteed. 
Avalon Bay has announced before some months, pave the small street again and seats, that among other things are thought for a cafe, to which the business would like to rent area, furnish. 
The idea, that Avalon Bay could buy the street, was done during the session in this month public for the first time. 
Michele de Milly, a speaker of the Avalon Bay, said, that the business wanted admittedly to use the street, it doesn't necessarily want to possess her/it/them however. 
" The main-concern of the Avalon Bay is it to renovate this dilapidated alley and to do " to a public venue, said her/it/them and added that the city itself had proposed the sale. 
Seth Donlin, speaker of the department for building-protection thought, it has actually been the wish of the city to sell the street and emphasized, the task of the department is it rather to develop the real estates as, to administer. 
If The Boweries compared with his/its colorful neighborhood, extra has retained Place something of his/its historic impression. 
Some believe that the street has received her/its/their name in the year 1802, as apportioned a big farm, that belonged to Philip Minthorne, between his/its numerous children and a narrow strip country from no was claimed. 
The back door of the music-club CBGB, the punk rock-monument, that was locked into the year 2006, opened to the extra Place and the street is certain at the most known as scenery for the photo on the Cover of the album " rock to Russia " of Ramones. 
The plaster was wonderful, Danny Fields said, the manager of the Ramones, who had done the photo in November 1976. 
The street was full from scrap metal, rags and sharing of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes. 
Some inhabitants, including whom Bloggers, that write about the Gentrifizierung of the east Village, have, the idea of the sale of extra Place refused, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, still public should remain. 
Others have praised extra Place as a rarity? a practically unchanged splinter of the city, that should be left alone. 
Jeremiah Moss, that drives the Blog by the name of " Jeremiahs vanishing New York ", untertitelt with " the book of the complaints: A more bitterly nostalgic gaze on the dying city ", Place, that had appeared to New in the magazine " The Yorker " in the year 1952, has published a part of the conversation of the city-history over extra. 
The author, Brendan Gill, has written at that time: " Extra Place is a small narrow dead end that remains dark even during the day and through rusty Metalltüre of the warehouses, taciturn windows and at gutters past flying week-old newspapers is marked. 
With few exceptions, the street has looked in an evening specifically so recently. 
A rat through the rear part of the street, not far from the door, who led to the CBGB earlier, ran where a teureres clothing-business is today. 
Graffiti was to be looked at the walls and an empty beer-bottle didn't lie on the ground far from a fresh bundle of discarded newspapers. 
Some passer-bys said, they would rarely have thought Place about extra, proposed however, that the street could be polished something. 
Fields, added that according to his/its opinion, some people the attraction of the street in her/its/their current condition underestimates. 
He/it said the best years of my life were in the places, that were dark, moist and disgusting. 
Debate about bilingual education: Formation in English-language surroundings 
In this edition of the " Education Watch ", Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates to the bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, leading scientific co-worker in Kalifonischen studies and leading director in the school educational-sciences at the Pacific Research institute for Public Policy, a co-author of the book " is not as good as one thinks: Why the method-class needs " a varsity. 
A complicated task is to be gone down well with the hispanischen voters. 
Barrack Obamas suggestions to the topic formation are a typical example for it. 
Obamas election-campaign mentions, that " the likelihood to complete the school with afro-amerikanischen and hispanischen students successfully, lower is, as with white students " - what is correct. 
In order to close this performance-distance, Obamas educational-plan specifically recommends under others a bilingual transition-phase in the education for the ones, that learn English first. 
Nevertheless the question consists at Obama of it whether his/its use for the bilingual education, that puts the main focus on instruction in other languages as English, disagrees with his/its interest to reduce the distance in the school-performances. 
Let's take Sixth Street Prep ", a primary school in the eastern Los Angeles, as example ". 
Hispanisches are the majority of the students and come from families with low income. 
Learns English more than a third of the students, from which many are only since short in the country. 
Nevertheless, students of the fourth class have insisted the state-examination into 2008 astonishing 100 percent in Mathe on a good level. 
Also surprising became 93 percent of the children from the fourth school year in the English-examination as well assesses. 
This astonishing success was reached with other methods, as the ones, that are preferred by Obama. 
The school of Sixth Street puts her/its/their main focus on checkup and practice, on steady control of the knowledge and a stand, that tolerate no exceptions. 
The school practices the base, after which the education proceeds in an English-language surroundings, the further. Exactly that is the point, that Obama should heed, the headmistress Linda Mikels so. 
This base attaches value to the almost exclusive application of the English language in the compartment-instruction. 
Woman Mikels, who refuses the idea of bilingual education, said to me, the school would have a remarkable success with a student, who had come before it from Mexico first shortly. 12 months later they would enter the class-area and can recognize him/it no longer. 
Worked ", she/it remarked, " it works for us ". 
Would Obama take a school like the " Sixth Street Prep " as model for other schools with big share in Latin American and other English learning students? 
The performances of the school would do the answer on this question easy, however the educational-political positions within his/its own party, the national Bildunsgvereinigungens support the idea of bilingual education for a long time, and forecasts do his/its own consistent support of the bilingual education over Obamas answer doubtfully. 
While he/it agrees to the point, that Immigrant Englisch should learn, he/it has trivialized the topic recently in that he/it remarked that people should stop, have worries about the legislation aiming on " only English ". 
Stattdessen, he/it said: It should guarantee " her/it/them that your child Spanish can ". 
If Obama wants actually to close the performance-distance, he/it should take educational-models, who work, instead of despising her/it/them into account carefully and, to trivialize. 
The Ölpreis sinks because of renewed fears about the economy 
The petroleum-price is on Monday on the basis of the fears that even the American rescue-plan could not be enough for the finance-markets to enliven the economy again, strongly fallen. 
The crude oil-futureses at her/it New Yorker trade-stock exchange has fallen in the Vormittagssession about 7 percent on $99.80 per Barrel. 
Since last Monday, the price has sunk about more than $20. 
In the last two weeks, the goods-markets are as well as from the finance-turbulences at the embankment Street and also as from powerful tornados in the golf from Mexico been jarred. 
After the prices had reached her/its/their climax of $145.29 per Barrel in July, they have fallen in this month on almost $90 per Barrel, about then again, as consequence of the enormous uncertainty in him/it finance-markets to climb. 
On Monday, investors have procured themselves shown already again, although congress-representatives had announced, they would have agreed at the weekend on a rescue-plan, that should be the biggest in the history. 
This message was overshadowed from new worries that the finance-crisis is not still completed with wide. 
In the for the moment last chapter of the growing crisis, shall, according to a government-communication on Monday, that Citigroups buy up the bank-businesses of the Wachovia Corporation. 
Has Belgian, Dutch meanwhile and luxemburgische governments the European finance-concern Fortis partial nationalisiert. 
After analysts with Barclays Capital, it has not succeeded despite the taut negotiations, that taken place at the weekend and has led to a rescue-plan, to enliven the mood on the markets. 
Since the economic situation gets worse further, is to be expected that the demand will sink after goods, among other things after oil, further. 
Analysts the German bank have written in a communication to investors, the prognoses for the global capital-markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely doubtfully. 
We believe, they write further that the goods-markets will be also concerned. 
" From the perspective of the goods-markets, we are procured over it the most whether American virus stretches the U.S. world-wide, especially to China ". 
The analysts of the bank have corrected her/its/their expectations for the Ölverbrauch on the basis of the weak economic growth for the coming year downward, and her/its/their prognoses for the oil - and Gaspreis for the year 2009 about 20% lowered. 
Team-record through series in the second quarter aufgestellr 
Inside-defender Shaun Ellis thought that he/it would have seen everything after he/it accumulated the Jets-Trikot in the last eight-and a half years more frequently than each other in. 
Then, he/it saw the second quarter, in which the Jets transformed a fruitless game into a triumph-train, on Sunday. 
I have never seen " " something similar, Ellis said. 
After a sloppy game between the Jets and him/it Arizona Cardinals, that corresponded to the bad weather, began the second quarter. 
As Quarterback board reached Favres Pass Lavernues Coles for one 12-Yard-Touchdown however, that marked the perfect start to an afternoon at him/it her/its/their itself developing cooperation a giant-step to the front did. 
Favre found Coles in this quarter for still two Touchdownses that one slipped as an Aussenverteidiger once and once the other 10 seconds before end of the half-time. 
" I have not exerted " myself particularly, Coles says them/her/it to Coles about the passports went. 
" He/it is a super-player. 
Our vote has been correct, think " something the people no matter. 
During Favre and Coles catch played, the defense dismantled Quarterback Kurt warners. 
Outside-defender Darrelle Revis intercepted an unsuccessful throw and transformed him/it into one 32-Yard-Touchdown. 
Libero Erik Smith came to another Pass and intercepted him/it. 
Line backer David Bowens provided a loss of warner then. 
The last ball-loss, forced with Bowens, the craziest was probably. 
The Cardinal had the ball conquered the ball as the Jets with still 10 seconds remaining in the game, Jay Feely recaptured and changed a 20 yard of shot into the 34 to 0 captaincies. 
Most points ever have achieve that that the Jets in one quarter. 
As he/it was asked to describe the craziness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets " Das second quarter or the third quarter ", answered? 
Both on the answers, because the Jetses admitted 21 points in the third quarter to achieve without a single, Mangini said: " Believe me, I have enjoyed the second quarter more than the third. 
A quantity points was achieved " in short time. 
Rested Gebrselassie beats his/its world-record 
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has shown again why some consider him/it the best long-stretch-runner of all times after he/it has broken his/its own record in the Berlin marathon on Sunday and has turned into the first human being, who has managed the route of 42,2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes. 
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has improved result of 2:04:26 its former about 27 seconds that he/it had reached last year in Berlin. 
Gebrselassie, 35, has his/its 26 with it. World-record in his/its versatile career, in which he/it reaches at least a world-championship-title on each route of one kilometer up to the marathon or has put a world-record, puts. 
Last month, Gebrselassie has omitted the Olympic marathon in Beijing, from fear, that was maybe exaggerated in retrospect, that the air pollution could exacerbate his/its asthma-problems. 
Stattdessen has registered he/it for the match in Berlin. 
In almost ideal conditions - with sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the goal - has won Gebrselassie with an average-speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile. 
Since track-runners like Gebrselassie and Paul have changed Tergat from Kenya to long-routes, the record-time be please for marathon in the last 10 years about more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo has won Costa from Brazil in the year 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05 there. 
After his/its victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie of the press has told, he/it would have had cramps in his/its calf two weeks ago and could not therefore train a week. 
He/it is obvious refreshed after pause and eingerostet come not back. 
" I am so happy ", he/it said to reporters. 
" Everything has perfectly run. 
I have lifted the training a week ago again and had some misgivings still today, however in the end something of all super ". 
He/it was criticized for it - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from Ostafrika - that he/it orchestrates his/its Rennläufe unduly, many world-best marathon-stars generally avoids, itself too much on the Rennanführer it leaves, as if that would be a track-race, and world-records over the match put. 
However this criticism hardly harms the size Gebrselassies as long-stretch-runners. 
Accompany had reached Gebrselassie the center of the route in 1:02:04 from four Kenianerns on Sunday. 
Two elite-runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi still has challenge Gebrselassie after the speed-makers had reduced. 
Something more than three miles before the finish has made Gebrselassie his/its last commencement in order to part with Kwambai, that have arrived as second in 2:05:36, and with it his/its best time about almost 5 minutes has improved. 
Kamathi became third in 2:07:48. 
With women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Germans, has completed a remarkable year in that she/it has shown the seventh-fastest result of all times with 2:19:19. 
The world-record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain. 
In the last spring, the 36 year old Mikitenko had won the London marathon in 2:24:14 surprising. 
She/it has missed the games in Beijing, because of problems, that became described as back-injury. However, she/it has recovered in order to win in Berlin and, to improve her/its/their best time in her/its/their third marathon about five minutes. 
She/it has sent her/its/their sprint planned, in that she/it a quartet from Ethiopian and Kenya-niches runners first had run away, but after 30 kilometers passed. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became second in 2:21:31 while Helena Kiprop arrived from Kenya as third in 2:25:01. 
The pride and the strains in the life of the black population, in a city of the quite particular type, 
Hide between the protuberances of the leisure time-parks in the vicinity of Orlando, few miles of the glittering, is and gigantic drift removes, a quiet city, in which the pride and the complications of the Afro-amerikanischen culture come to the light, lies. 
Eatonville, that first fully black city in the country and the home town Zora Neale Hurstons, it is to be described no longer as simply as Hurston in 1935 did: " the city with 5 seas, three Krocketplätzens, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison ". 
Nowadays, it is a pilgrim-place. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrisons and Ruby Dee are to the annual Zora! Lost festival in Eatonville the most famous author of that Harlem renaissance to remember. 
And is nevertheless and remains the city, that she/it describes? and that she/it to a Touristenausflugsziel it did in that she/it accepted her/it/them into him/it Florida guides, that were produced to the times of the depression of the Federal-author-project? in much sense a place of the quite particular kind. 
Eatonville is so independent, solid and private like in the 1930ern, as Hurston wrote, that rural black communities in Florida often refused to divide her/its/their true thoughts with the white man, that " so little knows about us, that he/it doesn't know something him/it escapes ". 
Even nowadays, in one year in him/it a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, senator Barack Obama, to an open conversation over race-circumstances calls, it is still sorry many here to be observed by outsiders. 
" We are been told 59, from birth at an inhabitant of the city and parishioner of the oldest church of the city, roofed on it like our history, according to Hortense Jones, very much. 
It must be correct ". 
Eatonville will define long time as paradox of the triumph and the fight. 
It is both a historic example of the black movement as well as a community of almost 2.400 inhabitants in which the poverty-quota is double so high as the Landesdurchschnitt. 
It is a stronghold of the literature and on the other hand an example of that on the one hand - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south, that has her/its/their roots in the American slavery. 
It is not surprising that inhabitants here as well as is with pride also as on the hat. 
And so right the misgivings actually began about Eatonville's image with Zora as all Hurstons name here. 
She/it introduced her/its/their home town to the world in books, that came from hearts and were written in dialect, just like " Mules and Men " (1953) and " Their Eyes were watching God " (1973) 
Five paragraphs in the Florida-guide changed the city, that quite close to the route 77 lies, a street that through the often-forgotten center of Florida leads, to the arenas of black history and human drama. 
Impudently like Oskar as well as in the real life also as in the literature, Hurston Leser led first mayor, Joe Clarke, to the store of Eatonvilles and turned to more private issues then. 
" Away from the street to the lefts ", she/it wrote, that is " brown -weiss painted modern school, with her/its/their groomed gardens and playgrounds, of which Howard Miller always takes care, although hardly reads he/it and can write. 
She/it mentioned also the new man of widow Dash and wrote that lee sells Glenn " beverages of each type and goes " was-auch-immer with hour-rooms. 
In only few hundred words therefore brought Hurston Eatonville with self-government in connection, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was no guide quite certainly. 
Indeed, this was not a portrait, that was estimated by all. 
" Zora described the things so, as they, according to the 90-year old Ella Dinkins, were " the Hurston one of the Johnson-Mädchen perpetuated in that she/it quoted the men, the songs over them/her/it her/its/their beauty sang that was more fully sexual insinuations. 
She/it added: " Some people didn't like this. 
One still remembers here Hurtson as an active eccentric, who came back regularly, after her/its/their family was drawn after Jacksonville, Florida. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that if raged Hurston into the city came, she/it this usually without warning did, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and with pants dresses, in a city that even today itself something on her/its/their venerable clothing-style imagines. 
Most inhabitants were fascinated loudly Mr. Franklin whereas much despised her/it/them. 
" The people were Zoras always to see " gladly, Mr Franklin said. 
But " she/it remained never too long ", he/it added during he/it in his/its chair teetered, on a terrace situated to the back, that looks at the Sabelia lake, in which was baptized according to Hurston of all likelihood. 
As Hurston in 1960 died she/it was poor and her/its/their books assaulted. 
Together with the bulk of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her/it/them. 
Although she/it was a famous author once, a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard college in the 1920ern, she/it became Pierce, Florida, in fort where she/it lived, in an anonymous grave buried. 
In Eatonville, there was no big commemoration, no public readings in the big style. 
" I don't think that she/it her/its/their contribution in the world or her/its/their heritage in the least, according to Valerie Boyd, has understood author of " Wrapped in Rainbows ", a biography over Hurston the 2003 was published. 
The change came in the 80er years. 
Orange county authorities wanted to put a five-track-y highway through the city in order to replace the Kennedy Boulevard the slow two-lane main street of the community. 
Orlandos suburbs had already pushed the highway 4 through the western outskirts. 
The suggestion was presented as Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in his/its history. 
Compulsory-integration, among other things, an end had put down the relatively idyllic isolation of the community. 
In the 50er years, the fight brought Hass into the community against race-mixture. 
Often came " in this time a pile of white boys and she/it oranges and stuff threw on them/her/it away from sedentary people ", Mr. Franklin said. 
There was a woman was killed that with it even once. 
You/they threw a watermelon out of the car ". 
In 1955 questioned Hurstons in a letter at the Orlando Sentinel the demand of the colonel of court of justice, to force integration, in that respects " her/it/them his decision in the case Brown against the inspector as " abusive instead of my race, marked. 
Inhabitants say nowadays that although the annulment of the racial segregation was positive in some sense, she/it that the group-cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of his/its teenager weakened. 
" Black children were it accustomed to be embraced - I reminds me at it - one they embraced his/its teacher in the morning and embraced his/its teacher in the evening ", according to N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and business-leading director of the nonprofit group to the protection of the Eatonville community. 
That could be gotten up for a very long time, she/it added until teachers and students came from the same place no longer. 
" They didn't embrace his/its white teacher, because he/it was a white teacher - I my there is existing " a cultural gap, woman Nathiri said. 
However the franchises have contributed to it that room was made for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists, who disregarded prejudices, just like she/it it did, with positive self-confidence and statements like: " As anybody can refuse itself the joy of my society! 
I don't understand it. 
In the year 1975, the author Alice Walker got going to Hurstons nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her/its/their fame. 
Five years later was a much praised Hurston-Biographie of Robert E. to find Hemenway in the bookshelves, and made her/it/them renewed to a part of the American literature-canon. 
The highway-project came exactly to a time, in which Eatonvilles stood most famous daughter in the light of the public once again. 
And Hurstonses saw this time old neighbors she/it as savior. 
The community began in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston festival in order to show something the district with the construction of the highway could destroy. 
Thousands of fans came to the Eröffnungsevent two years later, and every January, many come back for the celebration. 
Some years later, the district of his/its street-building plans turned away. 
" The plans of a five-track-y highway enlivened the city, the totals accelerated with top-speed, awakened real citizen-pride ", woman Nathiri said. 
Woman Boyd somewhat more simply expressed it: " Zora rescued Eatonville ". 
The victory against the highway-project has contributed to a change of the self-picture of the city. 
Newcomers came more and more, just like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer, that goes since 1993 here into the church, and natives began to estimate the past again. 
Eatonville was accepted 1998 into the nationwide historic register. 
A new one-story library, named of course after Hurston, opened in 2006 on the neugepflasterten and beautified Kennedy Boulevard. 
Nowadays, Eatonville is still a peculiarity in Florida: she/it sometimes can only 6 miles of the downtown of Orlandos itself feels like a behind-alley in summer-moving, as small as at that time as she/it from only 27 black families in the 1880ern was established. 
, She/it is black to 90% nowadays, 
Outsider on the search after the history Eatonvilles and his/its meaning is often treated with caution still. 
For most interviews, an authorization is necessarily in the advance and certain things - just like the wall-painting of Eatonvilles eldest church, that was painted whitening by one and represents black men with the field work, - cannot be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, assertive teacher with a preference for Dunkelrot, still fears, that her/its/their shielded community is misunderstood. 
And nevertheless, at the same time to her/it the Hurston-Festival bigger became, also an elevated degree was born at home-pride. 
Above all young people are inclined to it to see Eatonville so like Hurston her/its/their entire race saw: very beautifully, with all his/its problems, neither bad even better and just as proud, creative and hard-working, foolishly and durchmischt like each other races - and Völkergruppe in America. 
It can hear the sincere love to this city that one in the voice from Mr. Franklins Neffen, the 18-year old Edwin Harvey, that intends to come back after the college after Eatonville in order to work in the administration or with the police, that could use some help according to him/it. 
And even the younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, elfjährige twins from winter park, to have, to describe Eatonville right, learned. 
" Most people, that drive through only here, will think: " Oh, this city is nothing in the comparison to all the other ", Alondra Kenon said on a Sunday after the church recently. 
" But if one actually stops and looks at a moment his/its history long, it is a very beautiful city ". 
Here with us in New York, one speaks finance-Latin flowing. 
Nothing has changed on the first gaze. 
If tourists kept away themselves in Manhattan of the newsstands and the huge television-umbrellas in the Times Square, they would not at all notice that they are in the middle of a debacle. 
You/they would never believe that over her/its/their heads, in the shoe-box-good offices with the glass-facades, bankers and Hedgefondverwalter, that have the monopoly in New York, daily the worst horror-working day since the stock exchange-fall of 1929 has. 
The suppliers still push sidewalks with pure rattles along the metallenen Teewägen and transport trays them/her/it with Muffins for the breakfast-sessions laden is. 
Latinoses still shuffle between apartments around, like human pack-animals loads with approximately 50 ironed T-shirt, that hang at a yoke-similar pole lying on her/its/their shoulders. 
Office workers still wait actually on the sidewalks deciding meal-stands on her/its/their Frühstücksbagel and it, a yellow taxi is still to be received impossible at a weekday between 16 and 19 o'clock. 
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until I decided Thursday on the basis of all of the world-downfall-talk afternoon to open a new savings account. 
Although I had decided to put my duty-walk trunk-branch on the quiet late-afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase timewise, already approximately 20 people stood snake. 
To take not off at the money-counters about money or to deposit but at the Kundenservice-Schalter where patrons order checkbooks, tourists after the way to the department store of Macy's ask and where new customers open accounts. 
Most before me, so I learned from stiff, my " personal bank employee with license ", later stood for the same reason like I snake. 
in contrast to me however, they had already lifted up her/its/their spared of smaller banks, at places from where commuted from she/it, just like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Iceland. 
You/they had money of so named Thrifts resembling a little of a Bausparkasse, cooperative-banks and those local savings banks, that have branches only in one state, lifted up and says that they treat her/its/their customers like family. 
In the last year, 15 of these banks have gone quiet and quiet bankruptcy. 
In the last few days, Washington Mutual went, a bank with installations in height of $327 billions, in receivership over and as letzen Friday New Yorker over the weekend home drove, was Wachovia, another bank, the savings-installations in the value of $440 billions possesses, on the search according to a rescuing buyer. 
In the fear before another collapse, that brought office - and store-employees that before me queued her/its/their pure is looked at to a bank that as sure harbor, a bank that for most Rettungsaufkäufes at the embankment Street responsible is. 
Angeeignets have quite normal New Yorker itself in the last weeks flowing finance-Latin. 
A woman, who telephoned in my Chinese trunk-supermarket, took reference on Lehman Brothers with so much familiarity, the bankruptcy gone bank and their it gotten thinner looking Vorstandsvorsitzenden Dick Fuld as she/it would make malicious remarks about a lazy colleague. 
And strayed Lyn, that is about the 50-year old uniformed Concierge of my block of flats, of our usual conversation-topics over Brad and Angelina and my food-delivery. 
" I now have all my savings in money-market-funds ", she/it told me after my visit at the bank. 
" I have changed, I enter no Risko more.

`Ich receives the master behind the stage, about his/its character festzuhalten', Günter Brauer, photographer. 
No paragraphs, no frill, no outfits for the appearance. 
The nature of the big flamenco-dancers, that abstains on the concentration and devotes itself the interpretation, to receive about a relaxed look as woman or as man. 
On the one hand artists 
On the other hand personality 
I look in private life in, into these moments, that are foreign for the public, I knows, when I for the personality typical gesture, the depth of a stolen gaze or Ausdrückstärke of the hands, that is concerned, because is not entered her/it/them the stage, can find. 
In his/its project `Flamenco-people ' represents builders' abwechselungsreiche theatrics of some productions the German photographer Günter on the stage with singers, dancer and guitarists. From this side, he/it was even little known for the artists. 
With this suggestion, the photographer manages a special Ikonografie of the flamenco-representation on different levels. 
The showing, that belongs to the program of the month of the photography of the flamenco, `spiegelt the international importance of flamenco, that becomes ever bigger from the day to day, wider', the artist explains and clearly does that `Flamenco-people ' `jeder any human being can be, but if one looks at the photos, so the observer notices that it is no typical pictures of artist on the stage. 
Quite normal people on the portraits are artists, who are in the situation, passion, sorrow, joy to mediate on the stage and to move the public with it. 
In order to be able to hold on the personality of these artists, one must do no photos on the stage. 
Her/its/their personality and her/its/their character is in her/its/their hearts. 
What interested me to manage a personal atmosphere, that would enable me, was the characters of the biggest flamenco-masters festzuhalten' with the photo-camera. 
Farmers, inspires from the festival of `Cante de Minas' read, did itself in the year 1997 on a long trip in order to photograph singers, Gitaristen or dancers with a Digitalkamera. 
Thanks to the picture-sorting-function of the camera and the existing material, pictures, that remind of classic photography, originated. 
The application of different stylistic methods destroyed the classic basis of the picture, through which the picture the modernity and the idea, like the farmer flamenco understands, is lent: `Musik with traditional roots that changes and every day überrascht'. 
That is not only the dance, the chant or the instrumental-game at itself but the personality of the artist, his/its character, that tempts the public with his/its art. 
The search after the essential, after a certain something, which in form of the harks, the being visible becomes, is and was the solid goal of this work, that in the near future in the gallery of that El Fotómata is presented. 
Friend personalities in flamenco under them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belongs to the narrow selection of the almost seventy artists, that was photographed. 
The project turned into an anthology of the flamenco and will appear as book, with all portraits from the showing, soon. 
Builder's passion to the portraits led him/it to it to take up this idea two years ago again and to realize as `Porträts of the veterans of the Sports', `SportARTproject '. 
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people ' different is, so the photographer gives to `es pleases me to photograph the people to know her/it/them very much to learn and to put me into their life-condition, be it for a short moment or a longer time. 
I think that the portrait is the most difficult type in the area of the photography. 
You meet or run into persons, personalities, whom you don't know sometimes at all, or they leave you alone for one pair of minutes in order to be able to do a photo. 
Apart from these circumstances, as photographer, I try always to realize my ideas. ' 
The collection of the portraits of the flamenco from today with the title `Flamenco-people ' is in the gallery the El Fotómata, that is in the street with the name la calle de la Mata and gets lost la Alameda de Hércules to the street parallel, displayed. You can the showing up to the 16. Octobers view.

The hispanoamerikanische novelist arranged that there are `keine type and Weise', by which one judge, and from where one can know whether books change the life, `aber I, to believe me in it, it denies that the literature emphasized pure conversation, a fleeting experience ist', Vargas Llosa whoever claims that apart she/it `Effekte hervorruft' and `die people even more bringt', therefore I didn't ask the author `sich of the ease überlassen' and `die Verantwortung' for his/its appeal `übernehmen '.

`Sangre de mayo': Heldenbuch of Garci 
Inspire from `Episodios Nacionales' of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci represents the revised version of the famous rebellion of the Spaniards against the French in `Sangre de mayo'. That is an admirable film in the Filmografie, with approximately 15 millions Euro investment for the trick-works. 
This way the cineast has tried `eine quantity of personalities and social analysis darzustellen', what he/it has always admired at the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained with the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the start of a long table of the actors today. 
`Sangre de mayo' with a film-length of more than two-and a half hours, is presented this Friday in cinemas and is shown on the station Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries later. 
José Luis Garci, big fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that thanks to this trick-work his/its `Kindheitstraum ' in fulfillment went. He/it has this to owe Esperanza Aguirre, that engaged him/it before three years of the autonomous community Madrid, a memorial-film to the second century-celebration at the 2. , To turn November in Madrid. Above all, because the history is based on the basis of `Episodios Nacionales', that assumed the job. 
The total-contribution of 15 millions, that was put by the autonomous community Madrid for trick-works, offers Garci as he/it inflicted, that `einmalige Möglichkeit' with help of decorations and corresponding clothings the picture from the `verwirrten Spain, which picked out the wrong leader for the fight, because brought the people had become darzustellen' through the fight for the independence and under the reign of the Ferdinands of the VII in remains. 
However, the cineast regrets that one with the funding like with `Alatriste ' or `Los fantasmas de Goya', twice so high as with `Sangre de mayo', could not calculate, therefore some scenes could not be turned from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci almost worked together his/its whole career. 
For this reason, Garci, that was also film-director in `Volver at empezar', has participated through his/its usual operation: he/it placed himself/itself on the stage in regard to the actors, with whom one must first rehearse, before one starts to turn and he/it appeared to `demütigend for the ones, that had done no Casting, ' and respect procures, `ein part of the occupation of the film-director consists to achieve help in the theater and in the cinema in order to know what of the cinema-industry, in which one works, happens. ' 
Many actors, into whom he/it runs in `Sangre de mayo', must repeat before his/its camera, like in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. 
Garci, Oscar-candidate in four nominations, from which he/it has won one, is of the opinion and assured that no one of the three candidates, that defends in this year of Spain in front of the Academy of Hollywood, represents a young generation of the Spanish Filmographie. Neither `Sangre de mayo', nor `Siete mesas de Bill-ary francés' and also finally not the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'. 
For this film, Garci expects no awards. 
You believe `Am start, that you work for the posterity, later you notice, that it is only for thriving, and now you are content, if one produces another film hat', Garci explains employment after more than 30 years.

Her/its/their dance-bases have helped me in flamenco much. 
`Der dance of the Schmetterlings' felt to me like Guajira for example, or `der dance of the Schlange' like tango. 
You dancing was sensually and me has been said that my dancing also in this aesthetic area liegt', she/it claims. 
The production reckons with two exceptional cooperations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel with one of her/its/their ideas again, as he/it has done it also in `La puerta abierta'; and with flamenco-master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work as an exception together with one of her/its/their ex-schoolgirls.

'

`Ich wanted to call back her/it/them in memory, because I think, she/it is one of the women that has an enormous influence on a certain epoch and today their work no more and, therefore to estimate her/it/them even less, weiß', Bayón claims. 
The idea takes place about 20:30 in the theater Lope de Vega today.

So, `das Triennium of Zenobia and Juan is finished Ramón' with the new edition of this work, with the international congress, that takes place in New York, with the restoration of the house-museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the traveling-showing `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', that was opened in May and after which was she/it in different places in Andalusia, now New York reached and is presented in the course of the international congress. 
The andalusische advice for culture has also eight-hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', that published from Pedro Tabernero and was illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso, gets. The goal is to be made the person and the work of the andalusischen world-poets knowner. 
The USA can introduce themselves without Paul Newman badly 
`Manchmal manages God perfect personalities. 
Paul Newman was one of it. ' 
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, that with him/it in `Sensationsreporterin ' worked together, and from the at that time ruling idea of the US-American cinema which became calm in the sting, from whole America until Newman with his/its exciting idea came and her followed. 
Look simply what it cost her/it/them him/it to lend the Oscar. 
And as he/it retreated 2007. 
And he/it knew that he/it was very sick. 
Nevertheless, that was for finished a big hit. 
`Was one sometimes feels, is essentially more than an expression, and now I have a big friend verloren', Robert Redford said crying, `mein lives and my country were the biggest oddness of his/its life. ' 
No one had neither to make fear for itself ridiculously still to exaggerate. 
As `Vater ' the cinema and the fatherland has died he/it in a sad moment, in which fear prevails before terrorists and before the market-breakdown, in which the dejected self-esteem of the US-Americans is on the hopeless search after reasons in order to get back dignity. 
If only few people, that one can admire, remain in this hard time without virtue, so one must not necessarily be Luis Cernuda, about Paul Newman too dear. 
For all, he/it embodied a platonic ideal of the beauty and the truth quasi. 
He/it was official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered like different losses as well as also profits: from the foundation, that has prescribed itself to the fight against the drugs and was established in honor of his/its son from the first marriage, that died of overdose, until to the own brand of house-done and organic products. 
That of everything is a gift for the country, in which it cost him/it much effort, to become generally accepted against a deadly nutritional-culture. 
A wide wave of the amazement beats to take towering over Hollywood regardless of nationalities and citizenship. 
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that is dead not only one human being but the whole era. 
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film-director and Oscar-prizewinners, said, that the work with Newman was less than the top of his/its career no longer or not. 
Russell Crowe, the evil boy, who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his/its biggest inspiration. 
`Uns has all verlassen' the biggest of us, George Clooney, maybe one of few, who dares today, confirmed to live tries like Paul Newman lived: high requests at the righteousness get, a responsible private life, far from which cameras remove, leads. 
That possibly is not in the present-day media-jungle simply or not once always. 
But there is somebody, that tries it, and Paul Newman was an example for it. 
He/it had a time parted and was fifty years married after it to Joanne Woodward, that was loyal he/it, although there were surely many possibilities not to be it. 
`Wozu should eat a Hamburg I on the street if I have fillet at home? ', did he/it often joke even. 
In the heaven, he/it will be on it with pride that his/its daughters have the same opinion as his/its fans on the earth which is not absolutely usual in America. 
`Von all big roles, that he/it played, on no one was as proud as on them/her/it of the loyal spouse he/it, the loved father, the aware grandpa and that of the Philanthropen', they say. 
For the Olympic games, the streets are defective in Madrid. 
Yes, the dream of many of us is to be organized some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it can be 2016 however maybe. 
But I wonder: `Sind we for it prepares? ' 
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not correct! 
She/it was called perfect street, and according to my judgment, she/it was the worst street with all, that there was, therefore and at it. 
Nonsense is natural the one bulk, if they heeded the evaluation and I could test it, something similar would not have come through unequivocally. 
But, we go through everything from the beginning. 
The nonsense starts with the Ticketholen, that licenses you to go as first. 
It seems to me not to be bad either, but if they let you already proceed, they should give you also everything, including chip, in order to avoid the jams on the street. 
Therefore however not. 
Here, they leave you get only the ticket, that first nonsense, that consists of it, only therefore to go there, and, after an infinite line, the surprise is there! There was the T-shirt only in the size `S ', a second nonsense, because I need the size XL, 
Where do we actually live then? 
Oder is it so that was adjudicated after the crisis to buy only small, much cheaper shirts from less material? 
Therefore good, matters like these are a small thing in the comparison to the days on the street. 
Apart from it, that one must go very early in order to get the chip, a line of at least 15 minutes is already there and, furthermore, one must let the backpack lie. 
The attendant has lasted more than 35 minutes, what in the case of a street, where 11 000 people are expected, is incomprehensible. 
Finally, as also expecting it was, the street started and we had not let our return-sacks lie before it, even if it was successful once, but getting back her/it/them would already be more difficult. 
Furthermore, it saw, in these 40 minutes wait after rain from, sodass it to the temptation, to organize a people-rebellion and to attack the little house, came. 
I believe, mornings will have some 500 people pneumonia surely and some like I will appear because of this chip, that I have received, with the Klassifikation not once in time, I can already think that the exit was stamped incorrectly. 
Of course, if they asked me about a perfect street, I would never think of this street. 
So I believe, we will still dream of a city, that is well prepared for the Olympic games, long 
Microsoft on the search after a virtual Rezeptionistin 
On the `Emerging Technology Conference', organizes from WITH, Microsoft has introduced the advance of the new picture-recognition-system and the human being-interaction, a nature of the artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is however capable, to take care of some primitive tasks, like for example a taxi orders or in the case of Microsoft, that is a route-planner in order to move on the campus of the business. The system heeds that, which it hears during the conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a form - and face-recognition-system, this `Rezeptionistin can ' how many persons are in the area recognizes, whoever are she/it and remember, as they were dressed, it can listen and the key-words of her/its/their conversation understand. 
It can classify also the present after the conversations into the groups. 
In the presentation-video, `die Rezeptionistin' notices a third person, but she/it understands that this person is not affiliated to the group, that leads with her/its/their conversation, and that also no Firmenangestellter is. 
She/it asks whether the person wants to visit somebody here and answers that she/it will listen soon. 
Everything without the blue Screenshot 
Impressive 
That is the future surely. 
Now, the business has better matters, on which it can concentrate, on the next version of her/its/their operating system Windows for example. 
They talked this week about the strategy-change of Microsoft very shallowly. 
Windows 7 will be faster and won't have so many tied in programs. 
Steve Ballmer determined that if the computers with the most necessary equiped, instead of to fill her/it/them with the commercial garbage, become work she/it so. Human being, Steven, that will be only for the few. 
Everything is only one observation if one considers that Microsoft in Windows versions one or other function and `Extras ' inflicted. 
The directional-change is worthwhile 
That Microsoft has right, the operating system loses meaning, exactly like the software, gradually. 
As Google chrome appeared in the network, that was a part of the theory that it is the first step of Google in order to compete with Windows. 
Skillfully many pointed out that the Browser is no operating system. 
The operating system, as an indisputable part, will always be necessary, so that hardware and software can work simultaneously. 
The operating system fills the function, that can be compared with the function of his/its wife or his/its husband, if it goes therefore to inform his/its mother-in-law of something. 
That is correct. 
The system will never vanish, but one must at his/its `Tod ', not as an absolute but as relative truth, thinks. 
What Ballmer said this week, the confirmation of this idea is. 
The people give each time of less attention to the operating system, for it more the Web-Browser. 
The computer is only started, about which Firefox, that to execute Explorer or chrome and every day, we spend more time at surfing, as in the surroundings of the `Fenster '. 
For what does the half serve in the computer of existing applications? 
Fewer is more 
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista. 
More easily, not so exaggerated, less complicated. 
The interest of Microsoft is more to integrate his/its on-line-services, that the alternative can finally turn into Google then. 
In the reality, they need that, without doubts. I bring a small example for it. 
I have the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recuperation-areas for Microsoft Angestellte at the beginning of the month done. 
On him/it refreshment-beverage-vending machine is fortified a sign: `Deine search. Our Zukunft'. It prints out a request to use own tool for on-line-search. 
In the year 2006, an independent study came to the end that the 66% of the employee with Microsoft, Google for the investigations in the network used. 
Incidentally, last week was also confirmed that the new version of the Windows has turned out for mobile 7 in the retardation. 
She/it doesn't become start but end of 2009 appears, sooner even 2010. 
Microsoft looks for the possibility to bring 7 and Windows to Windows mobile 7 on the mark simultaneously. 
Every day, the telephone changes in a computer. 
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other postponement will cost money. 
Le Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso has had on it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had on this brand in `Blood Diamond' of Edward Zwick, exactly just like Al Pacino in `Der Pate' of Francis Ford Coppola. Simultaneously, it belongs to clothing of a well built priest. 
If we start to list the innumerable Stars-Auftrittes, so we are able to go back on the picture of a very powerful man, with a pointed beard, that had hoisted heavyweights in a traveling-circus, falls back. 
Essentially taken, that is a typically male T-shirt from cotton, sleeveless and fits. 
The English-language name it `tank '. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands however. 
Firstly, because of his/its wonderful name, although she/it in the narrow circle `Marcel ' is named. The legend tells that the Namensentstehung is interconnected with sport and comes from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf. 
`La Marcel' towers above all because of his/its outstanding cotton, because of his/its different unisex-cut and draws itself through a small Belgian flag, hardly recognizably, from that these T-shirt have as detail at the neck-excerpt. 
And respect, the Belgian company concentrates not only on the production of `tanks '. 
You/they have also college Sweatshirts, boxers Retro, Cardigans and cashmeres, pants from cotton, T-shirt with strips, Babies, mini shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear. 
Although, it is very unfortunate to use her/it/them as sub-clothing. 
You/they are very appealing. 
`Ich wants to be a young mother; about him/it candidate makes me no Sorgen' I 
Her/its/their big appearance with her/its/their sister, she/it didn't prevent from it to develop her/its/their own personality. 
Mónica Cruz is dainty, but full of zest for life. 
Zurzeits take the siblings Gruz her/its/their new activity in the fashion very seriously. 
That means for Mónica essentially more, than for some pretty and is enough girl, who protects her/its/their reputation. 
She/it was in Paris with the promotion of the company mango, transfers her/its/their residence there and furthermore does the presentation of the most important prizes in the fashion, that sponsors the Spanish fashion-house. 
Mercifully and shy, winner on the short routes. 
Narrative us, what you do in Paris. 
I have come, about the new collection for this Herbst/Winter season, that my sister Penélope and I have drafted for mango, to present, furthermore I have visited the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and have taken at the Dinner to Valentinos honors part. 
A very intensive working time, that is simultaneously exciting. 
You/they work for the Spanish house which is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for mango? 
My sister, as well as also I is fascinated from the cinema of the 50-er and 60-er years; there finds many ideas we. 
I like to go through a city and observe women, as they are dressed, as they combine her/its/their garments, I often do that. 
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you are a very versatile woman, not true? 
I believe yes, but finally, everything meets in one and these areas have many mutualities. 
Since him/it I small was, I was filled from the clothing with enthusiasm; I wanted always to go to my grandmother in order to dig around in the clothing-wardrobes of my aunt and, to see her/its/their clothing. 
That was super, nearly better than into a leisure time-park to go. 
Already late, than dancer, I tried always to keep an eye on the clothing. 
You whiten yes, we dancers like so very much to have our own style in instruction and with the tests in order to look in the level and, to feel us with it well. 
As actress, if one receives the outfit, one puts itself into the real actor-role. 
Finally, everything is connected together, it is so, much respect before the outfit-designer and her/its/their Professionalität. 
Recently you have become 30, have you fallen into no crisis? 
Oh something. 
I feel better than ever, I feel good as thirty year old. 
I find, the woman becomes ripe, has experience and can enjoy the life with less mistakes. 
I have no fear because of my biological clock. 
I have done the matters that I was already small I since him/it, wanted to do and that has me much inner joy given. 
Therefore, do you think of it to become mother, or not? 
I already know for a long time time that I become mother because my body wants to require that and I want to be a young mother furthermore; that doesn't want to let escape me I. 
What involves him/it candidate, there I have no worries. 
I become, my child big lucky-feelings arranges and it with much love educates. 
What the film-art involves, so you keep the works, at which you have participated and were turned them/her/it last year, in the eye. 
Is that and I exactly so it would like very much that they are presented the public. 
I, as woman, that come from the theater, am very anxiously and restlessly and what cannot immediately be of course wants to have everything all at once. 
I wish very much that `La última hora's and `En will present de Cristo' de la tumba for the first time bus-about. 
Once it sees as they pleased you
Before one pair of days, you have appeared on the Laufstieg with Naomi Campbell, is that correct? 
Is good, something similar doesn't say. 
It is not so that I was on the Laufstieg in order to model. 
Naomi Campbell, that I since knows some time, has simply called me and to London has invited, about at a parade for the charity-event of her/its/their organization `Frauen for a better Welt' and the clothing, that we show, to participate. I know that two garments were auctioned from our collection for mango in order to collect the money for Naomis NGO. 
The people don't know Naomis good heart. 
Many matters are told about her/it/them. I, as the one, that she/it knows, would tell you, that they are not correct. 
Nevertheless, I will support this good matter, at which she/it is involved. 
She/it asked me to take part in the parade for this generous matter, but if she/it comes and asks me to do a handstand, I will do also that. 
, In order to support the women world in the third, whatever necessary is. 
The motorists, who can become relapsed because of the alcohol-mirror, become the `Alcolocks ' must install. 
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties because of the alcohol-mirror, in his/its car installs this system, which prohibits him/it, to start the car in the drunk condition. If he/it is inebriated, the car doesn't start. 
The initiative was already announced in the last month in June and a part of the report of that is already now general-prosecuting attorney-sheep. According to her/its/their statements, it is about a Piloten-Projekt, which will last one year long. 
The purpose is the Resozialisierung of the driver, why receives this one value for the Umerziehung of the Verkehrsverhaltens. 
Besides the general-public prosecutor's office, experience-in accordance with, also the traffic-ministry and the foundation of the technical institute will take part in it for security of the automobiles. 
Loudly statistics, between 30-75% of the motorists, that were shown the sails under alcohol-influence more than a time because of, itself again at taxes put down. 
The `alcolock ' would prevent that, because it is interconnected a system by car, it measures the percentage of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents car-start if the driver has done alcohol-test; or if an alcohol-concentration, that is higher than allowed, is determined. 
It costs more than 1 000 Euro, the expenses are carried by the one, that covers the sanction. 
In this context, a study, that was enforced in the USA in 2007, has shown that equiped cars already prevent with these appliances in the first year after his/its introduction until 65% of the infringements. 
In Spain, one reckons with it that 115 human-lives could be rescued annually. 
The measure restricts itself to the administration-sanctions for two reasons: , to take this holding back in attack, before it turns into an offense. 
And, to relieve about her/its/their implementation, a legal reform can be realized in the usual way, and nevertheless a reform of the Constitution is demanded, that for the prosecution-process necessary is. 
Still, the appliance is on the Spanish markets, in no business available, although it was already installed into some usefulness-vehicles and vehicles of the public traffic. 
Especially tomorrow, the deputy-house becomes because of the initiative of the Spanish socialistic worker-party, that proposes, to install this system in school buses, votes. This was already done in France. 
In Mexico and without `peep-toes ' 
With British punctuality, at 17:40 o'clock, about the time, that was intended by the program, beside which presidential-hangars of the airport landed Benito Juárez de México DF, the airplane of the Spanish air force, with which prince and princess of Asturien traveled. 
The sun went down, but her/its/their rays have still forced to use the hand as parasol, about the royal pair, which got out of the airplane, to see. 
Directly at the ramp: the more Spanish messenger and other authorities 
One pair of hours before it, I had asked a taxi-driver on the street whether he/it knew that the prince and the princess of Asturien visited the city in order to formalize the official trip. 
- Ah, very good, therefore, there one can be no people of mitnehmenSie at the airport about this time from hieroder
No, she/it is the Spaniard, but she/it has lived one pair of year here. 
-Ach so, very well
But the Mexican press knows quite exactly whoever are the prince and the princess of Asturien and know the importance of the trip. 
It is also military-protection of 27 soldiers of the navy, that honorary-volley hands over, many, that wait in the hangar of the airport and at the red carpet. 
The prince appears smiling, dresses in navy blue, and she/it, the princess, with long from the wind blown hair, without usual `peep-toes ', was communicated her/it/them maybe, that a thunderstorm is expected in DF. 
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official retinue waits. 
At the door of the hotel in which they are accommodated, one of the four biggest in the city, a reporter of the Mexican television, who likes to do jokes, waits for her/it/them. 
The best Premium of the fashion 
Probably there was no more suitable place for the world as Paris in order to present a Premium of the fashion and there was probably no essentially outstanding fashion designer and Bonvivanten as Valentino. 
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion-competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' to the support and international increase of young fashion-talents. 
This becomes with money-price in height of 300 000 Euro marked. 
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, has her/its/their drawings in the display window of the mango branch on boulevard house-man number 54 yesterday in Paris seen and almost cried because of the emotional excitement. 
Incidentally, that is the second-biggest business of the company in Europe and was opened recently. It offers a sale-surface of 1 335 m²s. 
The biggest business is in London. 
So many events, that are interconnected with it, have happened that they would like to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his/its jury-leadership with the competition. Everything finished de Paris with a Luxus-Dinner in opuses nationally. 
Into the surroundings of many famous people, the executive-table, that was organized by mango, seemed to be spectacular. 
Nati, with which heavy heart, which was shattered by the pain, because his/its brother died recently, is keen together. He/it has put on the suit of the fashion-house and has had on some jewelries of ELAH, that were breathtaking. He/it stuck to the arm of his/its son Luis, that is big almost two meters and has, Valentino with the Dinner, to his/its honors accompanies. 
Andik, the owner and man of the house mango, such a cavalier greeted the guests and was, sodass he/it together with the baron of Rotschild without suit jackets finished, because suit jackets have lent her/it/them to the ladies. 
Mónica Cruz, has hastened to the business and which she/it itself modeled had on a pair of pants and a shirt, and to the Dinner, she/it carried a long, black sexy dress. With a night-walk through the opera, accompanies from Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet-tests, so she/it has gotten in excitement, remembered at the old times, grasped a pole and did a type `grand plie'. 
Inés Sastre, didn't affiliate the walk through the premises of the palace, but she/it had shown us the photos of her/its/their son before it on the Handy. 
In the next morning, we could be pleased about the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality, that always evokes a blustery enthusiasm, and on Jon Travolta, that after his/its arrival, with own bed-lacquers and towels, in the hotel Internacional in Paris, in advance, to have a room without smells, has asked. 
The stars under the star-full heaven of Paris. 
Ah la la, the life is so. 
1001 councils against Stress 
There is not 1000 but one occasions more, about chaotic us rapid everyday life too forgotten. 
And if it is also few, all are collected in a book, in which it says, as one comes to the relaxation. The book comes into the bookstores to the 30. September. 
The alarm clock is a penalty, if he/it rings at 7 o'clock in the morning, but even more badly the idea, again in the hectic rhythm, which requires the current life, appears pure-comes. 
The office is called the tension and the computer, that lead to the backaches. 
The Stress is the evil of the 21. Century. 
But there is not one and not two methods, about the daily exhaustion and the problems, as one relaxes from the working world to fight. 
The number climbs however, no longer and not less than until 1001 at. 
Beside Yoga-Stellungen, the classic massage or Spa-Behandlungen, Susannah Marriott represents the whole list of the possibilities, that is tried on at the taste and the time of each individual, in the book. 
The work against the Stress is called `1001 possibilities itself to entspannen' and so the silence, which arranges the book, comes Pearson Alhambra and DK into the bookstores of the publishing house. 
Whoever thinks, that it is impossible to reach the silence in the areas like job with help of personal contacts, so this handbook refutes beliefs such. 
Furthermore the methods are offered how one remains in the contact with the nature or proposed the 100% natural recipe, that leads to the relaxation. 
If the adrenaline high-climbs in your veins no longer in order to produce balance of the body again and the Stress has turned into a problem, so the moment has come to sit down on the sofa to switch off the brain and to concentrate harvests on that. 
Speak in the sleep 
Some children speak at night 
I my not the ones, that wake up and tell us something, which has happened on the day before it, with it, but the children, who speak during the sleep. 
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case, you will be terrified, but in the reality, that has no meaning. 
That is a positive insomnia, that is named speaking in the sleep. 
She/it is rather dispersed, above all with the children and teenagers. 
Surely, was told by you more than one, that you have spoken at night. 
This phenomenon can appear occasionally, a time in the life, for example, as while the up temperature, or regular, every day, a time per week, a time in the month, on the next day, the child can remember at nothing. 
There is no single reason, that causes this appearance. 
Often, for contexts are looked with other appearances in the sleep, like nightmares, panic-stricken fear at night, Enuresis noctura, bedwetting at night, speaking in the sleep sought, but there is no reason for it. 
As we have mentioned it already earlier, fiber, Stresssituationen or overstrain can care about very high. 
In any case, that is a little explored phenomenon. 
The frequency, with which it appears, is very variable. 
It can be, that one speaks quietly in individual words, whispers or it can an opposite completely his/its, screams, wines, long discussions. 
In the cases, if the remark is very intensive, is recommended to observe the child and to let discuss itself with a specialist in order to check whether a problem, which fear causes and comes this way about, is available. 
We have said, that it is a positive disturbance, therefore it is not treated, be it, she/it is connected with another insomnia, that can be treated, for example, with which Schlaf-Apnoe or with the Stress. 
What one can do is, a string of simple prevention-measures enforces: 
Attempts, to excite the child before not sleeping. 
Therefore, stressful television-programs pick out quiet game for the child and avoid, that awfully and something too wild is. 
With the nervous children, whom relaxations are recommended, relaxation-methods can be applied in order to help them to receive a certain inner silence. 
That helps the child to sleep quietly. 
If speaking occurs in the sleep once, tries to protect the silence. 
Think of it that it is harmless for the child and will be able to remind it itself on the next day at nothing, which has happened. 
Useful advices 
Don't wake it. 
That is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will wake up it rudely. 
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, therefore it rests. 
Think of it, if it turns out verängstigt after one pair of appearances, so it is recommended, which reason the child has for the fear discusses to leave or to find out. 
If they understand, what it says, what is not so usual, the child doesn't put down under pressure in order to enforce an interrogation and, to work out more piece of information. 
You will be able to so reach nothing with it, because if the child sleeps, it is unconsciously and cannot think about it. 
Furthermore, you will hear, what it says, but you won't know, what it dreams and why it says that, therefore they are ends, that you pull out of it, with the interpretation of the piece of information and him/it carefully. 
Maybe, it doesn't tell the child that hears her/it/them that at night and knows his/its secrets. 
Not once as joke. 
That causes much fear. 
Therefore, makes you no worries, it is nothing bad, that is a moment, that lasts only few minutes. 
Illhäusern... final 
After a long thirst-route, Illhäusern is finally on the game field on success-course again. 
Without big effort erspielten itself the yellow-black numerous Torchancen and managed to move one of those, and, to win the game so. 
The speed of this meeting, with which the aggressors had effort, to show her/its/their proficiency was not very high. 
After a first attack of the Gastkapitäns Kauffmann, his long-distance-shot passed the angle barely, Illhäusern should dominate the game with ease, and it succeeded alternate first Fonderflick with a long-distance-shot, then brain with a Hochpass, and Romain with a shot with the foot-top, to challenge the defense of Denmark. 
The opposing team blocked in the field-middle and let pass only the active Riahi at the top of the storm. 
The beginning of the second half-time should decisively is with first two through Riahi and Temporale of secured Torchancen, and immediately after it with the first gate for the Illhäuser through Marais, that stood exactly right, in order to assume a ball again, that in a first attempt of Diebold had been repulsed. 
His/its luck should be able to enjoy not however the illhäusische scorer long and is sent approximately twelve minutes to the bank, through which his/its teammates put underneath numerically, later had to further-play. 
Denmark knew not to take advantage of this however and opposed no big problems an illhaeusischen goblin, that itself only a little withdrew, about her/its/their defense to `verdichten ', besides in the up-to-the-minute seconds of the game, in which the ball passed after a big chaos very near the slat. 
Sarkozy meets furious fishers 
Before he/it flies to the united states, Nicolas Sarkozy will do another excursion into the Brittany. 
In view of the resolved stand of the fishers, that blockaded the Zufahrten to several bretonischens and Norman harbors on Monday, the French president decided to appear Tuesday morning in the harbor of Guilvinec in the Finistère, about itself there, to meet with their representative. 
Latter promised, him/it `mit a constructive Geist', to receive, and hopes, that he/it comes with `konkreten Vorschlägen'. 
The visit of the president takes place at the same time like a general-meeting of the crisis-committee that was established by the bretonischen fishers, in order to push through measures in view of the extreme increase of the diesel-price, that a record-value on average of over 1,14 Euro per liter has reached. 
According to the press-speaker of the Elyséepalasts David Martinon `wird the president with them possible solutions, in order to help her/its/their businesses, discusses to become competitive again, and the job-conditions and the payment of the sailors to sichern'. 
Sarkozy is expected by the fishers with determination. 
They quoted Tuesday morning in the Morbihan and Calvados protest-marches, the jams of almost ten kilometers of length caused.

Like expects the QGs announced her/its/their own victory in this television-duel, that should be pursued by one third of the American families, to the election as well as the Republican and the Democrats. 
The political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCains performance, although absolutely considerable, not `brillant ' enough, in order to enable him/it, was still to be stopped his/its decline five weeks before the presidency-elections in the election-surveys. 
The Gallup-Institut, from which was published an opinion poll, that lies according to Obama with five points in the front, on Saturday, 49% to 44% for McCain, is of the opinion that the Democrat does the better figure unequivocally. 
With the still undecided voters, therefore those, on which it now depends, Obama followed with 39% as winners from the surveys while 25% of them see McCain as winners according to a CBS-Umfrage. 
Obama should his/its start on Thursday with the good performance, that from his/its competitor Joseph Biden with first and single public debate with his/its Rivalin Sarah Palin, is expected, can confirm 
`Es would be a mistake to underestimate her/it/them. 
She/it has good Instinkte', this weekend warned Bill Clinton however. 
The Siebzigjährige McCain didn't stop to move his/its indisputable experience in the area of the foreign politics into the foreground, and with it quite clearly the `Naivität ' his/its opponent's to underscore respecting these questions, that formed the center of this first television-duel. 
`Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that... ', he/it emphasized several times. 
`Ich doesn't believe that senator Obama owns the necessary experience and the necessary knowledge, about president to werden', he/it assured furthermore. 
An attack-point, that since yesterday in him/it republican election-commercials is preached. 
Obama itself emphasized that he/it represents the future. 
He/it expressed himself/itself shortly and precise, without to have brought itself from the setting. 
He/it moved his/its ability into the foreground to make good decisions and the picture, that has the world of the united states, to renew. 
`McCain has not still understood, Obama however schon', a democratic election-commercial put down this weekend against it, in which Republican was accused, to have not grasped the complete size of the crisis, that weigh on the `Amerikaner of the Straße'. 
`Während the 90 minutes of the debate had to tell things over me to John McCain a quantity, but nothing over Sie', Obama denounced before 20.000 people, who had gathered on the occasion of an election operation in North-Carolina in streaming moving, yesterday. 
He/it mentioned not even the words `Mittelstand ' or `Arbeiter '. ' The finance-crisis procures Obama, that that Americans for at the geeignetsten, even still to rescue the economy at the edge of the abyss, holds, a clear advantage. 
`Die coming week could a crucial turning point darstellen', the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday. 
The democratic representative cream Emanuel, a former member of the government Clinton, compared the `guten of economic Instinkte' Obamas with those of Bill Clinton during the finance-crisis of 1998. 
For the democratic candidate, the momentary crisis is ist' `das Abschlussurteil of an eight-year old bad economic policy, that moved from George Bush and been supported by senator McCain.

`Haben you it notices that an election took place in Minsk? ' 
Teenagers and opposition demonstrated Sunday evening on the main-place of the weißrussischen capital, in order to refuse already in advance the results of the parliament-elections. 
Some hundred Weißrussens gathered Sunday evening since shutdown of the election-pubs on the market place of Minsk in order to protest against the fraudulent character of the parliament-elections. 
Although no result had still been announced, numerous teenagers had lost to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: `Der dictator shall zurücktreten'. 
Some admit that they have not at all chosen first: `Was is of use that, if however she/it hey with my voice does, what she/it wollen', a teenager says. 
You/they don't believe that the regime, that has appeared the foreign observers in the best light, is ready in order to lift the negotiations with the European union again to it to carry out a democratic change. 
The sanctions, under it the Nichterteilen of visas for 40 leading weißrussische personalities and the Aufeislegen of certain fortunes, could become lift, if these elections of the observers were considered clean. 
According to the opposition, they were not it. 
`Wirs were excluded by the election-commissions and our observers were not allowed to teilnehmen' at the count, heterogeneous union of twelve parties regretted Juri Potemkin, press-speaker of the union of democratic strengths, one. 
This is a cosmetic change, Alexander Milinkiewitsch emphasizes, former opposition-candidate for the presidency-election 2006 and leaders of the Pro-Europa-Bewegung, because it is of importance, whoever counts the votes, and that is the executive with us. 
If deputies of the opposition move into the parliament, then because was nominated her/it/them, and chosen not. 
But her/its/their move into the parliament can Sendezeit in the television, meetings in the regions and Gesetzesvorschläge mean. ' 
The opposition is therefore guilty it itself to interfere with the political game, because `der dialogue with the European union must become open. 
Because if our economy, that is opposite strongly indebted Russia, gets into a crisis and we don't reform ourselves, we are at risk to become a protectorate of Russia. 
Now, we want sein' independently. 
The opposition is afraid that the organization for security and cooperation in Europe, that have pursued the election-course of events, doesn't acknowledge the election as valid. 
She/it emphasizes that the election-participation-numbers appear too high, and that in advance the expansion of the poll, 26% of the voters of Minsk, that way has smoothed for each type of manipulation. 
`Haben you it notices that an election has taken place?, does the leader of the socially-Democrat Alexander Kozulin, one of the two last political prisoner, who was freed these of year in August, ask. 
Nobody was in the election-pubs. 
And it will be at most five deputies of the opposition in the parliament, in fact the ones, who correspond to the ideas of the government the best. ' 
The silence of the night lowers itself over the October-place again. 
In the television, president Lukachenko and the members of the central election-commission congratulate themselves on her/its/their success. 
Discussion - from the blood that became sure again 
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10 yesterday. Anniversary her/its/their foundation, and her/its/their president, Dr. Francine Décary, had to be happy all reason, because Hema-Quebec has turned into one of the surest and most efficient blood-banks of the world. 
And in particular she/it has regained the trust of the public, that had become badly shaken through the scandal of the infested blood in the 1980er and 1990er years. 
As one knows, the national blood-reserves administered by the blood-donate-service of the Canadian red cross were hepatitis contaminated during the 1980er years with the HI-Virus and him/it C-Virus. 
In view of this drama and the dissatisfaction of the public, the government Canada led a public in February 1994, through the judge Horace Krever led examination one, that had to the goal, to bring light into the circumstances, that had led to a such tragedy, and, to work out guidelines, to prevent about a renewed catastrophe of this type. 
While judge Krever still hesitated to hand over his/its report, several provinces put a committee on the legs, his goal was it, at that time to develop a new system into the administration of blood-cans in Canada. 
In Quebec, the committee filled Gélineau this job. 
After the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood-banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, that is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood-society, to look after around the other provinces and the two territories. 
`1998, as Hema-Quebec has lifted her/its/their work, 38% of the people hardly had trust into the blood-can-system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary. 
The situation was discouraging. 
Through the enormous efforts, to improve about the security of the blood-cans, and through the work in this area during the following years, we have the trust of the public zurückgewonnen', she/it says before she/it emphasizes with pride that almost 94% of the population of Quebec had trust in Hema-Quebec start of 2008 in the meantime. 
Dr. Décary keeps in the consciousness however that `Vertrauen somewhat extremely fragile ist'. 
Since her/its/their foundation at the 28. September 1998 trades Hema-Quebec after the principle of the caution. 
At this time, we experienced the appearance of numerous cases of the human form of the beef-craziness in Europe with, a new type of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Krankheit, this woman, who occupies the management since the foundation 1998, tells. 
`Und we it didn't have the lowest idea whether this illness could be transferred over the blood. 
Therefore we referred to one of the main-guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, that according to one applies Ausschlussmaßnahmen, if one doesn't know this and if an illness progresses only slowly as it is the case, that expresses itself through a degeneration of the brain, with the Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Krankheit obviously what leads invariably to the death. 
Therefore, they assumed no blood of persons that had been since 1980 longer than one month in the united kingdom in April 1999. 
Now, before some years was proven without each doubt, that this illness is transferred over the blood. 
So this event has shown us that the principle of the caution, that we would apply, absolutely has a sense. 
1999, a much more exact technology appeared on the market to the recognition of HIV: The nucleic acid-tests (NST), that make possible it to prove the occurrence of the virus itself in the blood of the donor directly, and not that of the antibodies against that virus, as it was the case with the tests used until now. 
The NST made possible it to shorten the incubation period, that between the time to which the person was infected and that, if the first viruses can be proven by our technologies in the blood, takes place, the specialist explains. 
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week. 
The risk became so that certain donors could be infected without knowing it and could not recognize this one, essentially reduces. 
These improvements made possible it, the risk, AIDS over a blood-transfusion too figurative to lower in considerable measurement. 
Nowadays, one of 12 million persons is at risk to get infected blood with HIV. 
`Mit other words is called that that one had to would distribute 12 million blood-cans before somebody would be infected with HIV. 
Since Hema-Quebec distributes every year between 400.000 and 500.000 blood-cans, it would last more than 24 years before a case, with which HIV was transferred over a blood-can, appears. 
I believe that one can feel well with it nowadays if one receives a blood-transfusion or prescribes, about the health wiederherzustellen', the management-boss of Hema-Quebec thinks. 
`Unsere challenge for the next ten years is it to get the security of our products. 
One never knows which pathogene can reach into the system. 
Only in the last year, Réunion has appeared on the island the Chikungunya-Virus, that, equally like that west-Nile-virus, through insects over the blood is transferred. 
We must überwachen' continuously, continues Dr. Décary, before she/it emphasizes, that Hema-Quebec beside a certain care must make available a sufficient care furthermore. 
`Der demand climbs because the population ages. 
Since the treatments are more aggressive to the cancer-fight, the patients often need new red blood corpuscles or blood-little tiles. 
The Überalterung of the population has an effect also on the blood-donor-network, to which belongs in the average only 3% the resident of Quebec suitable to the blood-contribution. ' 
Each healthy human being can with it, that 18 years or older is and the suitability-criterions fills, all 56 days, therefore six marks in the year, blood donate. 
In the average, 14% of the persons, that make available her/its/their blood, are not assumed, because has sickened she/it at AIDS or malaria for example, and whoever has traveled is excluded for one year of the blood-contribution into a country, in which malaria is dispersed. 
`Mit these 3% manages we to get an inventory, that correspond to the needs of the hospitals. 
Lacking supplies are very rare. 
But one must renew the members of this donor-network if they become older and can donate no blood more. 
It is heavy to convince the people of it to donate blood, above all however, to hold her/it/them and to bring her/it/them to it, to become regular donors. 
The life is so hectic nowadays that one rarely finds the time, a hour with the blood-contribution to verbringen', Francine Décary regrets. 
With a year-It-budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood-cans but also human tissues, under it bone-transplants, heart-tabs, eyeballs and skin, that use almost exclusively with heavy fire-injuries, becomes. 
These tissues are examined, processes and freezes up, before they are between-stored with Hema-Quebec, that administers also the only public umbilical cord-blood-bank of Quebec. 
In the umbilical cord, at which was looked earlier than biomedical waste, rich blood, that can be used for it, is at trunk-cells to treat heavy illnesses, like for example leukemia. 
`Vors some weeks celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord-blood sample we, and we plan to decrease annually more than thousand. 
`Wirs should probably begin beginning of next year with it, it for transplants to the disposal to stellen', explains Dr. Décary further, that this program of that umbilical cord-blood - decrease as very popular describes. 
`Viele mothers are convinced of it, no access to it to haben', because Hema-Quebecs are missing the methods to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals of Quebec. 
Soccer - Impact in the semifinal 
Montreals Impact has itself yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1-triumph, 4 to 3 with all gates, against which Sounders from Seattle with the second and adjudicates game of the quarter-final-series qualified in the Saputo-Stadion, for which the total-score counted, for the half-final-round of the excretory-games of the first league of the USL.

Yesterday evening, that drove from Alex Kovalev, Tom-ace Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn educated unit the attack on the panthers from Florida with a storm-fire in front, what to one 3 to 2-wins led. 
Kostitsyn, the star of the meeting, shot a gate, Plekanec delivered two presentations and Kovalev transformed a Pass in this Siegesspiel, that fourth of the Tricolore in six preparation-games. 
Kovalev achieved the victory in that he/it shot the only gate of the whole shooting. 
Is not yet ready `Ich, the Russian warned. 
I need another game so that I feel well. '

But I believe, the end of the game has pleased him/it. 
He/it got blustery applause. ' 
Charest favors the north 
The premier doesn't exclude still to introduce before end of the year of elections. 
As soon as the general-meeting of the liberal party had finished, Jean Charest went after Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday where the new health-minister Yves Bolduc (left) tries to be chosen in the present-day part-election. 
`Den course our last big border in the north verschieben': This is the long-term goal, that Jean Charest introduced with visual methods with the general-meeting of the liberal party of Quebec in Levis, with which he/it followed the broad outlines completely, yesterday,.. 
During his/its lecture, a type Bildermühle was projected behind him/it. 
On three gigantic screens, spectacular pictures of hydraulic power-works, mines, rotated viewed from Quebec in `Google Maps', maps, etc 
Big methods like during the election-period. 
The premier refused incidentally opposite the press to exclude that he/it will keep away the elections this autumn even if he/it let transpire that his/its appointment book is very full. 
The `Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a `Vision ' that the premier has for Quebec supposedly, namely that of a `neuen Wirtschaftsraumes', that an unification with France respecting manpower, an agreement between Canada and Europe and unifications with Ontario intends. 
Although she/it was mentioned in the speeches of the premier recently frequently, the opening of the north was - the northern area on the 49sten degree of latitude - never topic of a presentation been. 
The premier limited to state on it however, why the north is `ein jewel with enormous Potential', named no date, no investment-sums or exact priorities for the coming projects however. 
At most some outlooks on that, at which could be worked more,: Above all at the water-energy, at the forest, but particularly at the mining-sector, favors through the growth of the newly industrializing countries and the renewal of the public infrastructures. 
The north possesses the enumeration according to Mr. Charests `Nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even Diamanten'. 
This `Gebiet twice so big as Frankreich' `ist in our proximity, is in Quebec. 
It is not only in our proximity, it is in uns', he/it emphasized as in order clearly to show that he/it seeks to realize a national originator-dream. 
Quebec has grown through his/its connection with the north very much, he/it emphasized: the street to the gold into Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, the James-bay. 
`Es hears us, it is our Zukunft', he/it added after he/it had put in a theatrical pause in order to look at the gigantic card behind itself. 
The north, 70% of the area of Quebec, closes a part of Labrador with one, that Quebec always called in, the premier of the press explained opposite. 
`Dies is a traditional stand, that all governments pursued. 
There is a borderline, that there is no unification since very long time, if the opportunity presents itself, I become this stand in the name of the government einnehmen' again, he/it explained. 
Furthermore, `mits the climate-change must our vision of the north überdenken' we again, he/it explained and talked about the northwest-passage, that will be passable the whole year on the basis of the thaw. 
Before this new geopolitical background, the premier thinks that it is virtually a duty to occupy this area. 
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit? 
The premier said that the government Quebec would interact very cautiously with them, and that they would profit from this project, above all the boys. 
Two former ministers of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau, former pekistischer deputy of Ungava, advices have already introduced with approximately thirty communities. 
A minister-committee escorted by Benoît Pelletier, in Julie Boulet (transportation and mineral resources) an important place earns, has lifted the works. 
The premier doesn't exclude a big meeting, `nicht necessarily a Gipfel', but an opportunity, with which `men manage themselves a common vision, wird'. 
The development of the north will go in agreement with the principles of the lasting development off besides. 
the plan North becomes `besprochen, regulated and umweltschonend' is, he/it promised. 
Jean Charest described this `Vision ', as if she/it is derer of the liberal premiers, that was before him/it in the office, a continuation. 
`Wies the Liberals, that were before us in the office, have rethought we in order to transform the challenges into new growth - and Entwicklungschanchen. 
This was one of the topics piled up again and again of the weekend incidentally, that on Friday with a big cocktail-party to the celebration of the 50. Jubilee's the takeover of the party-leadership through Jean Lesage was opened. 
One of the assumed decisions intends to rename the power plant of Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm. 
`Von Godbout, that has created hydro-Quebec, over Lesage, that has reached the quiet revolution and the nationalization of the water-electricity, to Bourassa, that has done the James-bay, always knew our party, the future to bestimmen', declared Jean Charest. 
With respect to the press, he/it took on another, this time conservative intent reference, on the program `Roads to the North' of John Diefenbaker, premiers from 1957 to 1963, in fact. 
With reference to the project hydraulic power-barrage Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest, who is intended his Inbetriebnahme for 2012, emphasizes. 
`Das stops, but I intend, with it to sein', he/it entrusted his/its party members what evoked applause-storms with those. 
The premier, who has said in April, that there would be no elections 2008, and surely also 2009, the possibility has indeed, this autumn, to keep away an election, what is possible him/it from the law, not yet excluded. 
He/it emphasizes that his/its appointment book is however full, above all because of a mission of the community-advice in China and a summit between Quebec and New York. 
The general-meeting of the weekend procured the liberal party-boss a platform from nationalistic plans, above all from `die constitution relevant Zielen', that were assumed without further,: The PLQ demands especially the acknowledgment of the `Besonderheit Quebecs' in the constitution. 
She/it would also like that Quebec nominates members of the council of the Canadian broadcasting and telecommunications, and that these possess a veto respecting the pronouncement fallen in Quebec. 
From sides of the opposition, the broad outlines of the plan became North with skepticism lifted. 
The boss of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has forth-gotten the politics to the development of the Nord-du-Quebec, that the government has introduced Landry 2001, again. 
Be her/it/them, the liberal government has, as she/it came 2003 to power, gives up it to apply these. 
If she/it had done it, `wären we today already many weiter's, woman Marois judged at the side of her/its/their candidate in Jean-Talon where the election takes place today, Françoise Mercure. 
The ADQ has voiced agreement with it, the assumption of a plan North, to support through the government. 
`Aber something we wants, is that this not only a big idea wird', the party leader Sébastien Proulx declared in agency Mario Dumont, that comes back from the vacation today. 
Letters - in dishonored country 
Mr. Vic Toews, ex - ' Justiz'-Minister, which irony, in the cabinet of Harper, it, that afforded itself to say about Louise Arbour last summers, be she/it a `Schande ' for Canada. 
This woman, who doesn't finish one, wanting fight for the justice has led and all our admiration deserves to cover with humiliation so, just as much says about the persons about the premier around, as over Stephen parkers themselves. 
We have to do with a government, that have not gotten their countryman caught in the concentration-camp Guantanamo as single from all the concerned countries home, here. 
A government, that takes into account not once, that Omar Khadr was another teenager, as the things, that are accused him/it, happened. 
The only government, that despite the fact, that Canada has signed the Genevan convention, her/its/their word breaks and lets a Kindersoldat waste away under inhuman conditions. 
The single, that condescends to a justice-parody in order to assess the blame of the defendant. 
Let's call us in memory that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the union of the Canadian lawyers plead for it above all to get Omar Khadr home so that he/it receives a just process in Canada. 
Exactly this government locks also the eyes before the torture: It interests her/it/them little that surely a young grown-up after so many years of the pain for always emotionally broken will be. 
We are ourselves his not yet consciously, but we experience exactly a malignant trimming our right, our freedom and our `Demokratie here ', this word, that carries Harper like a flag before itself constantly, and that from his/its mouth so meaningless sounds. 
The time, that there is no morals more, has therefore come: One can abuse a Canadian citizen arbitrarily, tortures and locks up, completely after discretion of a government head that is supported until today only from the minority, he/it likes after the 14. Octobers completely to the minority belongs...). 
Many voters believe to find her/its/their salvation with a party, the virtue, law and order preaches. But they don't see that this government has dissociated herself/itself from that, which amounted the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
The disgrace, Mr. Toews, lies in this renunciation, and nowhere different. 
Outside opinion - the orwellsche speech of Barrick gold 
In her/its/their edition of the 17. September published Le Devoir a letter dated Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-general director of the Canadian gold-mine Barrick gold. 
This confirms, and pursues an orwellsche logic with it that the biggest gold-extraction-society of the world a slander-complaint over six millions against three authors and a young impecunious publishing house-home strove for, with the goal, a `öffentliche, to open transparent Debatte'. 
If it is correct, that the judges are independent and impartial, then they don't pass a judgment on the truth, above all not in the case of slander-complaints but over the law. 
As expect, this basic difference became completely discreet from Mr. Garver. 
Because for Barrick gold, the best type is one to lead a public debate to drive everyone into the ruin, that it dares, that its reverse notion to represent. 
Quite same, as the process goes out, the authors and the editor of the book of Noir Canada will have to pass out considerable sums in order to prepare her/its/their defense and to fight with very unequal arms against an army of lawyers, that are paid from the nearly inexhaustible bags of the gold-mine. 
The tactic with these unequal fights is often besides to be ruined the defenders in order to force an einvernehmliche regulation, that the other side makes silent, and furthermore everyone, that dares it, to deal with the question again, deters. 
If Barrick gold really wanted a public debate, she/it would have had to present her/its/their view of the things before the public opinion. 
In contrast to it, what in many that countries, in which Barrick gold works, walk and would give is, normally becomes debates in Canada through the exchange of ideas and delivered not through stick-blows. 
It would therefore have sufficed if the gold-mine had disclosed her/its/their books and files and a real debate would have opened, through the newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent Prüfteams that would have been able to bring light into this question. 
But Barrick gold seems no trust to have into the public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters to the support of the authors of Noir Canada with a sweep of the hand aside. 
Could Mr. Garver explain maybe, as simultaneously he/it about a `öffentliche ' debate can ask and with it however the opinions just this public disregards? 
Seemingly, this word includes only the generously paid lawyers in the world of the vice-president, and not the community of all Canadians; a quite beautifully restricted view-manner of the concept. 
In a democracy, slanderers even have to speak the right. 
What Barrick gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is, that the public, that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada, therefore toots this above all, because she/it refuses the brutal stand of the gold-mine. 
This public is ready to it to listen to Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework, that many perceive as gag-complaint, in the course of the `öffentlichen Debatte', Barrick gold has directed exactly a demand at the authors of Noir Canada, in which she/it demands from them, to use this concept no longer...). 
Apart from the surreal speech of Mr. Garver, the complaint of Barrick gold is a direct attack on the freedom to the academic research and the truth-finding that is fundamentally for each democratic society. 
She/it denies the right completely to quote believable sources and to discuss facts and interpretations, that the basis of the intellectual work forms. 
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore topics and to discuss, that pleased not the rich businesses of this world, whoever can do that then otherwise? 
If Barrick gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she/it could lead these in that she/it follows the scientific norms, that use from the authors of Noir Canada, became. 
She/it has a right to answer. 
The universitäre surroundings, to which we belong, knows for a long time to get the grip on debates and incongruities and to solve conflicts. 
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick gold clearly shows that she/it, in contrast to him/it, which she/it pretends, has no desire on a transparent debate. 
This is a loss for the university-world, equally like for the public debate, and it becomes time that the governments take measures, that restrict this type of unjustified complaints. 
Rescue-action for them/her/it embankment Street - Democrats and Republican understands itself 
The administration Bush and the leading congresspersons, Republican and Democrats likewise, finally came to an unification over the most extensive economic-rescue-plan since the big depression of the 30er years yesterday. 
The new version of the plan over 700 billion U.S. dollars that should stop the finance-crisis, that jars them/her/it embankment Street already for months, must still be assumed from the two congress-chambers. 
The main-contents are: , To secure a better control of the deputy over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms, about the repayment of the started public moneys, new disposals, to dam about the number of that on the basis of houses impounded by payment-remains, just as the right to oversee the salaries, that are paid at the leading employees of the backed businesses. 
The American finance-secretary Henry Paulson, the president of the deputy-chamber Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republican, present with the negotiations, senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, some minutes after midnight, the good piece of news, after a two-day negotiation-marathon. 
`Wirs have made big advances in direction of an unification, that market-effectively his/its wird', the representative of the administration Bush, Henry Paulson, explained. 
`Es happened to everything, about the real economy and the American people before the course-crisis at the embankment Street to schützen', the Democrat explained. 
`Dies is the basic point: If we the doesn't do, the trauma, the chaos and the unrests become sein's in the daily life of the Americans enormously, the Republican Judd Gregg explained. 
The negotiations had accelerated during the last both hours, from fear before the effect, that would have had a renewed failure on the mood of the investors. 
The period, that had been arranged, was morning the market-opening today. 
The two American presidency-candidates, who took part in the negotiations first late, appeared the unification sooner than advocates without missing however to express her/its/their dissatisfaction over it that one must be met her/it/them with this extreme way. 
The democratic senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain disposals to the unification, above all such, that it should enable the owners to keep her/its/their houses, and such that the salaries of the leading employee involve the establishment escaped by the state. 
`Wenn one the taxpayers therefore, to take extraordinary measures on the basis of the irresponsibility of certain persons, asks, that is nothing, on which they could congratulate itself. 
But these measures are notwendig's, he/it explained on the American television-stations. 
As he/it was asked on another station, whether he/it will vote for the proposed plan, his/its republican opponent John McCain answered: `Ich would like to know the details first, but I hope it. 
`Die guiding principle, that I have read, [shows], that this is a matter, that we all will have to digest, and we will be able to make progress with her/it. 
The option to do nothing at all quite simply is not akzeptabel', he/it said. 
The 700 billion dollar-arrangement is organized on it, with the money of the taxpayers 
He/it comes 14 months after a crisis, through bursting of a real estate-blister caused that first led the high-risk hypo-bar-credit (Subprime) to the breakdown, before she/it widened on further forms of more dispersed bonds, PCAA, and led finally into a freezing up the finance-strength and into the ruin of the banks and money-institutes. 
A group republican deputy was it, let the last week fail the first attempt to the unification. 
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain `giftige ' assets of the societies in distress only of the government secured and should not be bought, one believes itself from the dead end escaped. 
In order to round off the viewpoints for finished in the congress, one has added also a disposal, that means, that, if the government should do with this program within five years of losses, could raise her/it/them new taxes then, all the her/its/their started capital, to get back. 
The new plan intends the payment of a first sum of 250 billions, to which can 100 billions further to arrive, if the president looks at it for necessary. 
The payment further 350 billions must be given a farewell in a renewed vote of the congress. 
As a countermove for his/its help Washington gets shares in the backed businesses, that bring in to him/it in the case of profits dividends, and that can sell it again if the storm is past drawn. 
The Federal government will have the possibility, the seizure-procedures respecting the apartments, that are tied at the real estate-credits concerned by this plan, to detain, and to fix periods for the repayment and the settlements furthermore, that are paid at the leading employees of the concerned businesses. 
The developers of the plan would have gladly that the deputy-chamber votes on him/it already today, and the senate then on Wednesday. 
Despite all of her/its/their efforts, it is not yet sure that her/its/their plan will receive green light. 
Actually, further votes began against this intent, as well as from sides of the Republican also as the Democrats, yesterday. 
`Ganz obviously understands Washington us nicht', the Republican Scott Garett, member of the finance-commission of the chamber, explained his/its voters. 
`Ja, we have a big financial problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not that, that consist of it, the taxpayers to the cash register to bitten'. 
The democratic Abgeordnete Brad Sherman, leaders of a group in the congress, who is named `der Kaukus of the Skeptiker', puts the things differently there, comes to the same conclusion however. 
`Vierhunderts excellent economic-professors, under it three Nobel laureates, have written us in order to communicate us: We ask the congress to have put not down itself under pressure, and careful too superior, which way to become a hit ist', he/it explained yesterday. 
At the same time, we received renewed the proof in Europe that it is about a world-wide crisis. 
With an emergency-meeting, the three Benelux-countries quit the partial nationalization of the Bankengruppe Fortis for 11,2 billions Euro, 16,3 billion U.S. dollars, at. 
Intervening of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP gave Paribas known that she/it would give up it to buy up her/its/their rival, that are in big difficulties, since she/it 2 billions Euro, 2,9 billion U.S. dollars, in the crisis through the high-risk real estate-credits in the united states has lost. 
Fortis employs 85.000 persons and belongs to the twenty biggest European banks and the ten biggest insurers. 
' That is no lost money, the Dutch finance-minister Wouter Bos explained yesterday. 
To the balance, we get a right to vote and influence in the bank. 
Exactly that, which the savers and households estimate, is now there this itself uncertain times announces. ' 
During this time, the British government was on the other side of the sleeve-canal exactly with it, another of the finance-crisis, to nationalize brought bank in distress. 
According to the English press, the government would adopt all current credits at the bank Brad-Ford and Bringley, from it over 41 billions (75,5 billion U.S. dollars) from real estate-credits. 
The Spanish bank of Santander gave yesterday known that she/it would buy up the branches and the tidings-accounts of the British bank. 
Brad-Ford and Bringley would be the second bank, that the British government must nationalize since beginning of this finance-crisis, after Northern skirt. 
Paul Newman (19252008) - death of an engaged icon 
His/its beauty with the azure eyes was long time his/its trump, nobody would say, his/its weakness. 
Had the American actor freed himself/itself with the charming smile of the narzisstischen mirror? 
Yes and no. 
His/its tact, his/its sensitivity and an obvious talent have probably kept away him/it from a predominance, that brings the truly terrifying monsters to the world, as well. 
But something for a big jogger! 
The Paul Newman deceased on Friday in the age of 83 years at the consequences of lung-cancer on his/its ranch in Connecticut remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of that he/it golden year. 
He/it was less monumental as more carefully Brando, that he/it resembled and for which was he/it long time a manner rival on the canvas, in his/its drama, with it certainly also fragile, but equally an apostle of the freedom and the sprinkles of dramatic conventions. 
Miscellaneous blood often yields wonderful children. 
He/it was born 1925 in Ohio as son of a German Jew and a Hungarian-stocky mother. 
One of the glorious faces of the American dream should originate from his/its European roots. 
Without excessive ego, most outer quality-characteristic. 
Because a whole country, that was in love with the Self-made-man, mirrored itself in him/it into the fighter, who was injured in the Pacific-war in the skirmish, the beginning of the 50er years of histrionics in Yale again, the Actor's studio in New York studied and then visited, before he/it success at the theater, in the television and had soon also in the cinema. 
Just this man, who fought for the franchises, was also the driver, who became 1979 with the 24-Stunden-Rennen of Mans Zweiter, and furthermore a Sexsymbol, although he/it lived together with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958 in a token-relationship. 
Also the unknown facets of this mysterious, restrained vanish with him/it, engaged and opposite the Glamour of the show business oversensitive stars, his puzzles one will never solve completely. 
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word. 
The death Paul Newmans put the cinema-lovers this weekend into giddiness while all his/its big roles were played on the dark screen of the memories. 
Passes by more than a half century of American film-art in continuous change with him/it. 
There, the charming cowboy crowds from " Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid " (1969), who rejects his/its sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) into the cat on the hot sheet metal-roof, who was filmed 1958 of Tennessee of William, into the memory, and the young man, again. 
A much more shortly behind memory (1990) is evoked, that at his/its sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is disturbed in his/its high age of a wedding, that all her/its/their promises didn't fill. 
So much other Paul Newmans gave it in the sprint of the history. 
This criminal, blustery, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me, in hand fully dirt, from Robert Wise, a role, that was thought for James Dean, after his death was lifted again and made really known the Newman 1956. 
This nice crook in the outstanding The Sting (the highlight), that was marked 1973 with the Oskar for the best film. 
As embittered and revengeful billiard-player in the wonderful The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), 
This face through the times through, that was he/it. 
Still he/it. 
In his/its resume, epoches unite themselves. 
The youth knows him/it above all from the cult-film Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, that little orthodox trainers of an Eishockeyteams. 
His/its fans recovered him/it 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers Coen. 
With a last role 2003 as Pate of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes closed itself the circle. 
In contrast to several cinema-legends, that have retreated from the movie world sufficiently early, Newman should remain in the saddle long, and with it Hollywood, his/its fortune, his/its splendor and his/its concessions betrays. 
The French film-maker of Bertrand Tavernier saw him/it, not without humor, as living challenge at the `Underplaying ', as he/it judged his/its all too oratorical performances. 
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, whom the roles flew long time only so. 
He/it played however rare Sunnyboys as outsiders: Neurotics, alcoholics, Fieslinge or despaired, with their perfect representation he/it is slipping off and his/its rebellion reflected. 
As director of revealed Newman unknown sides of his/its true delicate sensitivity. 
His/its Rachel, Rachel of 1968, after the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence, with his/its Mrs. Joanne Woodward in the leading role, drew a subtle Frauenporträt full of melancholy. 
He/it, that lost his/its son Scott through an overdose, dedicated his/its film Harry and Son, a work full of tact and sorrow, this 1984. 
With the flood of honors, that poured forth over Newman yesterday, explained his/its narrow friend and former arms-companion Robert Redford, they had played the Sundance kid in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and together, extremely seized: `Seine present has improved my life and this country. ' 
Generosity and zest for life were essential qualities of the deceased actor. 
Apart from his/its legendary career, also a big proponent of the franchises, the environmental protection and the independent cinema, an opponent of the leeways of Hollywood, now indicates. 
We probably have him/it with the foot in peels Vinaigrette fully often, sees stand in sauces, pastries or other foods, and this for rather tasteless held, although we initially still found it merrily. 
The profits from his/its turnovers nevertheless flowed into his/its foundation for children in need. 
Instead of resting on his/its myth, Newman committed itself up to the shot. 
He/it left his/its five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Immer and until completely to the end, your father was incredibly gratefully for his/its good star. 
It was a honor, here, to be able to be. ' 
And it was a honor to be able to pursue the life of a so intelligent and generous American actor for us. 
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and in the widest sense. 
What became produced &amp into the bill-factory of surcharge; Co.? 
At the 8. Octobers begin the negotiations in the criminal-process against János surcharge and his/its accomplices. 
The participation especially becomes the defendants at the organized crime, just as roughly negligent damage and business-deceit, and other punishable actions - among other things Dokumentenfälschung - accused. 
That were used loudly public prosecutor's office from the announcements lukrierten methods for own purposes, during the produced performances often with phony bills was covered. 
State moneys and subsidies of the self-administration - altogether HOOF 65 million - partly shall Fiatal Baloldal into the cash registers of the organization, partly into the private-cash registers individual has flowed. 
How the investigation-authorities gave known, fictitious bills were submitted when covering the announcement-moneys, and the clubs should not have complied with her/its/their duties either. 
A bulk of the bills should have been falsified loudly indictment. 
The bill-blocks were bought at the market of Józsefváros, they had the round-seals prepared in Kiskunhalas. 
The decision over it, on which companies the bills should be displayed, was adjudicated on that tour from the flatten-lake north on which István Lados of János surcharge was sent. 
In the course of this " reconnaissance-tour " should do Lados pensions and restaurants available. 
He/it demanded bills over the Konsumationen, about later on these presentations based bills for the youth - and sport-ministry, the socially - and department of labor, just as to be able to display the self-administration of Budapest. 
These bills shall of the majority from István Lados and his/its accomplice, András ?ri, with which should have been responsible more final after our information for the constitution of the corresponding reports, has been manipulated. 
A beer-pub was one of the goals of Lados' " reconnaissance-tour ". 
How is to be taken displayed bills in the year 2003 two of surcharge and Co, the gastronomy-business should have entertained the ninety-headed group of the club Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
Now the boss of the business declares however, a so big group was not open in-fited into the pub. 
Another bill, displayed in the summer 2002 on the foundation work Jöv?ért, later known as Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért, also serious form - and content-mistake showed. 
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, that decrees over three rooms merely and can lodge simultaneously no longer than ten persons, 130 guests should have been according to bill. 
Within no limits were kept the make-believe of the bill-forgers apparently as well, as it about the Pigal Kft. went, a gastronomy-business, in his bookkeeping records of the customers not at all appear work Jöv?ért and Hoppá according to prosecution first. 
How manager Gy?z? Farkas of the hvg.hu told, was immediately clear to him/it that it was about phony documents as records were submitted him/it by the public prosecutor's office during an examination. 
" Our company name and the tax-number were incorrectly installed " on the stamp. 
And further: Apart from irregularities also the fact was wrong that the business should have lodged einhundert persons after they have altogether eleven rooms, that so many persons offer place impossibly. 
Also food has been quoted on the bill, the restaurant is time with it in business no longer for a long time. 
The industrious bill-forgers have also neglected to check, that the Budapester travel agency taken by them into the visor offers exclusively trips into the foreign countries, and so they have declared Hungary-trips on the cash payment-bill what of the Rechnungslegungspraxis of the company also contradicted. 
Like in the course of the investigations known became, they have quoted also the value added tax on the bills in addition although travel agency-performances, that refer to a country outside the EC, are value added tax-free. 
The height of the value added tax was altogether on four of the hotel Révfülöp Kft. at the foundation work Jöv?ért displayed bills wrong, since the business settles only 15 percent VAT instead of 25, furthermore exclusively mechanical bills are displayed by the co-workers, the phony documents were handwritten however. 
Another mistake, that the " Rechnungslegerns " were suffused, was that, that they had declared in a case " merchandise-transportation " as produced performance, although this of the company specialized on investment-advice is not offered, the public prosecutor's office told. 
Further irregularities - wrong bill-format, wrong stamp - was to be owed that that at Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, just as at XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont displayed bills as forgeries could be exposed. 
As well in the case of the Ravenna Bt. and the sport-camp Kunfehértó, whose managers declared, never to have displayed the bills. 
Another " mistake " is the forgers with the HIB Kft. happen from Nyíregyháza: This society was at the time (2001) namely exactly in dissolution, as the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület there should have eaten - the mass-administrator declared consequently even to have not displayed the bills. 
Falsified consciously 
Persons are the other group of the Rechnungsleger that was absolutely conscious, that they had to would put fictitious bills. 
On requests of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták has the foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány bills for the foundation Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért, in a height of approximately HOOF 4 million displayed. 
Loudly indictment became the manager of the Collab Kft. from one of the defendant, Ludovic Györfi, to the showing of the fictitious bills persuaded. 
That momentarily also in liquidation situated Biogate Kft. shall also with surcharge and Co. has worked together: In the year 2003, that shall Ltd. the foundation work Jöv?ért Alapítvány, just as the clubs Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny? Egyesület with phony bills in the total-value of HOOF 5 million, that referred to produced not performances, has looked after. 
There was just as little payment however since the bills were canceled directly after her/its/their showing what the concerned forget in her/its/their records however to note has. 
The third group of the Rechnungsleger includes persons, who are brought directly with the defendants in connection. 
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the mailcarrier of the Ukrainian manager of that delta Trió Kft., one in Budapest resident, there however not findable fuel - and vehicle-commercial firm. 
This company should have displayed in the time period of October until December 2005 several bills over the sale of EDP-components in the total-value of HOOF approximately 18 million. 
Loudly investigation-authority shall them/her/it since the 14. September 2005 in liquidation situated Cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas as buyers of these bills has functioned. 
Manager this company was a Romanian, whom the Firmendokumentes should also be delivered by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005. 
After our information, Kubatov has confessed during the investigations, bills in the name of that Ltd. at the clubs Atlasz and Hoppá, just as displayed at Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their value itself. 
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. just as the Jos-Investment Bt. should have been established by Romanian masons on Iván Kubatovs express wish. 
In truth, no one of these companies was active however, something loud defendant about lacking jobs lay. 
Nevertheless, he/it could profit from the businesses: On requests of his/its accomplice, the lawyer's Zsolt Szente, that was engaged with the preparation of the Firmengründungsunterlagen, he/it has displayed bills at the clubs brought with surcharge in connection in the name of the companies, like approximately at Atlasz and Y-Generáció. 
Altogether, Kubatov shall 15 bills in the total-value of HOOF 14,2 million in the name of the companies Cash Investment, delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos investment and Linaxtrade at the organizations has displayed. 
The public prosecutor's office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the bill-sum as well as the value added tax in each case. 
Kubatov shall even the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the showing of fictitious bills has abused - in this case was enclosed the bills the applications of Biztos Pont. 
The company Y-Generáció and Szövetség at Modern Magyarországért have her/its/their applications with the nonprofit organization of the socialistic party in January 2006, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA ") handed over. 
Both got per 500.000 Forints, these amounts have misused been of use. 
In order to hush up this, they have the TMA five fictitious bills the Works team Kft. submitted. 
These bills were guaranteed incidentally with the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the instruction-ministry. 
With the negotiations, it now becomes from some defendants with a confession over the procedure of the bill-forgery as they were already set aside before the public prosecutor's office, calculated. 
A sensation could be if the main-defendant decides János surcharge on an extensive confession. 
His/its previous statements were namely less elaborate, and although he/it had already promised several times to report inclusively on everything, his/its confession still endures. 
The question remains therefore open whether this lies in his/its interest whether the socialists have finished a pact with him/it respecting the recompense of the bulk of the originated damage of HOOF 50 million, and whether surcharge is as a countermove ready to adopt the responsibility. 
It is however absolutely possible that surcharge now plays the " offended " after his/its pleas had come upon mitigation of the imprisonment and house-arrest on numb ears. 
While other criminals that prepared much bigger damage with economic-offenses and this has not reimbursed, on free foot, or stands at least under house-arrest, surcharge remains denied this possibility. 
The psychology of the vies - or why we are ready to pay more 
With auctions, the buyers are inclined to it to spend more and to overestimate the sold consequently. 
Neurologists and economic-researchers of the university of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior. 
According to one in the " Science " magazine of published study, the people want fight in a competition, like approximately one auction on eBay, gives and is therefore ready to pay even raised prices. 
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this " game " with experimental auctions. 
A group of the volunteer should play lottery, during the other at a playful action participated - in both cases became the active brain-regions of the probationers by means of more functionally more magnetically resonance (fMRI) examines. 
With both games, the participants could win money, however an elevated activity of the Striatum, a complex below the brain-bark, with losers of the auction, with which outbidding of the opponent plays an essential role, was measured. 
Beside many other functions, this brain-region is responsible for the " self-reward " of the nervous system. 
The researchers therefore thought, the price-increase could be explained through the avoidance of a Überreaktion of the Striatums. 
In order to substantiate her/its/their thesis, the economists have employed examinations to the Nachverfolgung of the money in the researcher-group additionally. 
In this case, three groups should mitbieten against a partner under different conditions. 
Of the true value of the product was informed the control-group, they have done her/its/their uses after it. 
15 dollars of reward were promised another group in addition, for the case, that they emerge as winners from the game. 
The third group got 15 dollars before the auction, that was also lost in the case of a lost game. 
The difference between both groups consisted therefore merely of it that the emphasis with the one on the gain, while lay with the other on losing. 
As the members of the " group playing against the loses " were ready proof for the hypothesis expressed by neurologists to higher uses however, as those in her/it control - as well as the " Gewinn"-Gruppe. 
" These results can be derived from no former economic-theory. 
These have the behaviors observed with auctions only with the joy over the gain up to now namely, as well as the risk-avoidance justifies. 
The contradiction between these two theories was dissolved thanks to the picture-giving neurological procedures, sodass we now a third explanation ready has " - meant Andrew gravels, professor of the economic-faculty of the university of New York. 
Hepatitis: When is the doctor to be visited? 
Suffers approximately one half billion individual under chronic hepatitis B or C world-wide, and in Hungary, this chronic liver-illness is listed under the leading causes of death. 
The number the infected is estimated on hundred thousand in these parts, however only seven thousand are treated what is because of it that the patients don't often know that they are infected. 
Hepatitis is the collective-concept for through different viruses caused, infectious liver-illnesses. 
The symptoms are often like - hepatitis and jaundice is frequent, however the viruses and the illnesses differ of each other. 
According to viruses, the hepatitis-viruses spread on two different types: with hepatitis AT and E through the digestive-section, for example through impure foods or water, with hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transferred by blood and other body-liquids (like approximately sperm, divorce-secretion or saliva). 
Travelers become a vaccination against the viruses AT and B anyway recommended, against the virus C, there is no vaccine. 
The symptoms with hepatitis AT appears approximately two-three weeks after consumption of the impure food and is accompanied by Unwohlbefinden, weakness, stomach aches and nausea in general. 
The jaundice appears on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes light, the urine dark, and the convalescence can up to two-three weeks long lasts. 
World-wide, people die annually approximately 1 million of the by hepatitis B caused, much heavier illnesses like liver-cancer and liver-cirrhosis. 
Main-reason for this it is that is estimations according to only each tenth infected in medikamentöser treatment. 
Also hepatitis C can have serious consequences: unbehandelt can lead it to liver-cirrhosis and liver-cancer. 
Most infected know about her/its/their illness not once since the virus destroys the liver-cells insidiously - in many cases appears the first symptoms after 20-30 years. 
Timely preventing is therefore, as approximately regular control-examinations, imperative. 
There are three groups, in which this illness occurs more frequently,: those, that have undergone before 1991 of a blood-transfusion, Drogenabhängige, and tattooed. 
At present, the number of that is estimated sickened on 200 million at chronic hepatitis C world-wide. 
Since the illness is already verifiable with a routine laboratory-examination, it is advisable to visit the house-doctor with the first indications of unknown origin. 
Recognized in time, the illness is curable, the virus can become exterminate by what the infection-danger is entranced and is leaned forward the formation of cancer. 
The 30. September is the world-day of hepatitis, 2004 for the first time from Patientenvertretungen world-wide organizes. 
Aim the action to strengthen it, the consciousness for this chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, her/its/their formation and the meaning of the early-signal is. 
Has few pains believer? 
How newest research-results cover that the religious belief acts as a type " analgesic " that should already have relieved the death of Catholic martyrs. 
Scientists of the Oxford University have enforced an interesting experiment: It was examined, in what way the belief at God influences the Schmerzempfinden of the human being, the British leaf " telegraph " reported. 
In the course of the rather bizarre examination, it got per 12 believers and Atheist Elektroschocks while they studied a painting of God's mother. 
As the results showed, the believers could turn off the bulk of the pains. 
By means of a Hirn-Scan technology, one could even prove that the Catholics could activate the part of her/its/their brain, that for the pain-regulation responsible is. 
The examination was the first in a research-project, at which participates also philosophers and theologians of different departments of the university beside scientists. 
With the attempt, a glistening appliance was tied up the probationers to the left hand which handed over the electro-shocks. 
The participants were asked to concentrate strongly on two paintings: To the one a picture of God's mother, painted from Sassoferrato in the 17. Century, and to the other Leonardo there Vincis " lady with the ermine ". 
The researchers hoped that the sight of the virgin Maria under the believer would evoke a type religious trance while they selected Vincis picture there because it hardly differed from the other painting and as calms was felt. 
The test persons spent per a half hour in a MRI scanner, and got altogether 20 electro-shocks in this time in four stages, while either she/it the religious, or the other painting should look at. 
The Catholics reported, they would have felt with the sight of God's " mother in security ", as if they " would be umsorgts ", and they would have felt silence and peace ". 
During the considers of the religious painting, they have reported over 12% few pains, as if they had Leonardos work before eyes. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the attempt, thought, they could evoke similar effects also with other, strongly working pictures also with the atheists, one had to would find the corresponding photo merely. 
" We had to would find a picture, that causes very positive sensations, as approximately one mother or a father ", according to the psychologist. 
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright greeted the results of the research. 
" Practicing of the belief should change our personality, and toots it also in many cases ", according to Wright. 
After these outstanding results, the question only remains which effect a Madonna-picture of Leonardos or another comparable painter would have on the pain-regulation of the believer. 
Achieve the issue even better qualitatively high-quality virgin Maria? 
You are which you communicate over you 
On the occasion of her/its/their tenth birthday, Google can claim with justification and right: she/it is to be found equally in the bags of the people, as over her/its/their heads at the heaven: She/it knows where the people have spent her/its/their vacation to which specialists they go, and something she/it moves. 
And with it still not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the managers of Google. 
In direction skeptics, that are troubled by Orwellschen horror-visions, has organized he/it: These would overlook the essential of the Web 2.0 precisely. 
Schmidt thought in an interview with the Financial Time lately, the main goal of Google is it to collect personal data over the users even more and according to the original objective of the company, to come near, according to what she/it " wants to sort " all information of this world. 
Schmidt explained, Google is still world-changing work after ten years at the beginning of the Informations-Sammelns only. 
Asked Quo after the status in five years Schmidt thought: he/it wished, Google would be in the situation, I should do " questions like " what tomorrow? or " which job really goes with me "? , to answer, however software-programs are not yet in the situation to it since they would not know sufficiently about the users. 
Not all Internet-Users are in the clear to itself over it that the Suchbegriffes would be registered in the course of her/its/their Internet-Recherchen, as well as also the IP-Adressen, from which from was sought, and the visited sides. 
For example the Personalized Search " introduced " two years ago licenses the visitor to store his/its own Suchverlauf and to fall back on it later, sodass the hits later much more precisely can be generated, and also the so named " Recommendationses ", with which the system recommends custom products and services on the basis of the former preferences, are based on the same logic. 
The User wonder however - " if one, which I do ", looks - appears some procured whether the Google-Datenmonopols. 
In most cases, it is however rather that of the company represented, potenzielle power, that works fear exhilarating, and less the compunction or the fear before punishment, the quest after freedom or rebelling against the power that pushes with many Internet-Userns on refusal. 
It is a proven fact however, that the Suchbegriffes are stored not only but are relayed in the Anlassfall also at third, and in this Gesetzesfällen, there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet-Users. 
A parade-example for this was the action against Pädophilie in Brazil, in the course of his Google of the Brazilian government gave information, that was collected by the Gemeinschaftssite by the name of " Orkut " and enabled also an identification of the Pädophilien, lately. 
User concerned about personal rights could however still breathe a sigh of relief in May as Google pulled successfully with the franchise-organization EFF against the FBI before court together: therefore, Google can be forced also in future with no point of the constitution into it, information the FBI, to publish on secret inquiry. 
, However the Federal government has obtained the publication of 50.000 Web-addresses and 1.000 Suchbegriffens under reference on the youth-protection-law given a farewell years ago successfully, however the list of the individual User became her/it/them, respectively their Web - and Suchbegriffsliste on two months retroactively withholds.) 
Googles image therefore remains controversial: Those, that publish her/its/their personal data unwillingly, because she/it through the application of the Google-Dienste the loss her/its/their private - and private life fears, conservatively representing companies of proper revolt chastise the business with her/it him/it itself. 
Meanwhile, the American " Geek-Kultur " sees that is present in many countries and enthusiastic computer-fans, activists and User eint, the next generation of the " cool entrepreneurs " in them, in contrast to Microsoft, that is thanks to Windows Marktführer, even if fights both around the same goal. 
A possible reason for this it is that Google demands his/its Usern in contrast to Microsoft no identification-codes, and his/its services gratuitously to the disposal puts, sodass an open, constantly updated source code and Programm-Package much attractive, youthful and cool, to be, seems, as the official methods of the software-giant. 
On the other hand, the Geekses understand the problematic relationship of the personal right and the Internet razor-sharp - a relationship, that has especially moved in the last years thanks to the concept " Web 2.0 " into the center. 
With the " Web 2.0 " goes it about nothing other namely, than about collaboration, speaks that User leave on purpose tracks and is of use the available communication-canals, and even if the sizes are individually different, the most important thing remains the same to appear namely publicly. 
An average teenager can administer his/its profile on several Gemeinschaftsportalen simultaneously - from Facebook over Xanga, this can by means of other services, like approximately Twitter, or music-services connect like last.fm together, and can finally tie in all this into a Nachverfolgungssystem like approximately FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead Blogs, that represents the newest photo-galleries, that are geostets on Flickr or Picasa, automatically. 
And a row of further exemplary cases proves: The friend finds out with the respect of the party-photos of the bygone night soon, with whom her/its/their disloyal friend has had a good time, or the co-worker is released because he/it makes his/its anger in his/its Blog over the management air only all too honestly - an is sure: The concept " privacy " was interpreted fully again in the meantime. 
Whoever leads an on-line-life is that, which he/it announces from itself, - so in for example could formulate the reason-idea behind the behavior of the present-day youth one. 
And whoever tries to hold somewhat secretly, or cooks to handle the Google-Monopol, that can like to do - like approximately with Scroogle, a Tool, that admittedly accesses the Suchmaschine of Google, however on purpose no tracks leaves. 
Not few people don't register on community-sides on purpose so that they are not findable, but also the on-line-applications of Google, as approximately Textverarbeitungs - and graphic Tools and RSS-Feeds, has handled itself alternative versions, that are tied at no gigantic server-parks and don't generate the best possible profile of the User therefore either. 
The public opinion waits entranced on it meanwhile until Google shows her/its/their true face. 
With her/its/their present value of USD 156 bil. lie the business before IBM even, USD 140 bil.), Intel, USD 124 bil.) or Coca-Cola, USD 110 bil.), the advertising-surfaces of AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenues of the advertising-agencies, and the services more quickly introduced always make ready not only Microsoft but also other software-developers head-breakup. 
Critical observers find however also the worrying counterpoles: So the concern-management has fully rejected a protest of the co-workers approximately, after the dues of the company kindergarten were doubled, furthermore the management, that is mehrmalige food of the co-workers, thought too costly. That of everything appears however virtually mildly against it that Google even went in the year 2006 before the Chinese government into the knees and agreed with an agreement after what all regime-critical hits, or those, that offend against the good taste, would be out-filtered. 
The internal regulation of the concern is that no new service is applied in advance but only when this is also already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and year could roll up some powerfully again: While some thinks, Googles book - and Magazinscan - as well as Archivierungsprojekt assumes sizes in the meantime that the business had to have it out with the colonel court of justice soon, is rather others worried because of the system " Health " so, that the preparation of a complete health-profile on the basis of from results, doctors and problems enables. 
And the fact, that Google builds a genetic data base, already delivers the material to the next generation of the Sci-Fi authors - approximately " Scroogled ", the famous novel of Cory Doctorow describes a future, in which a human being becomes nahbar thanks to data referential by Google startling, in best orwellschen manner. 
Two teenagers help the duplicate-murderer of Ózd with the obey-elimination 
In the context with the duplicate-murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two teenagers, that are under the suspicion, to have helped with the elimination of the tracks, the speaker of the police-commissioner's department communicated Borsod on Tuesday. 
The teenagers were confessed, at present they are accused the allowance. 
After information of the news agency MTI, it is about two girls, who defend itself on free foot. 
Allowance becomes with a freedom-penalty from up to five years threatens. 
The suspect of the duplicate-murder of Ózd, a 23-year old local man, was taken on Sunday in detention. 
The man stands under urgent suspicion to have murdered several persons from greed purposely. 
In the course of the investigations, it has turned out that the 23-year old had owed a 53-year old a bigger money-amount. 
The suspect didn't want to settle his/its debts, therefore he/it lured his/its creditor on the last Wednesday on a terrain in Ózd where he/it murdered him/it and his/its nine year old daughter. 
According to statements of the MTI, the man has planned the action of long hand - this it proves also the fact that he/it has committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the scene of the crime. 
Together with experts, the police now examine the weapon as well as the circumstances of her/its/their application. 
Warschauer stock exchange puts purchase-offer for Prager stock exchange 
Approximately 200 million Euro, or 5 bil. the Warschauer stock exchange has offered Czech crowns for the hundred percent purchase of the share-packages of the Prager stock exchange. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warschauer stock exchange, confirmed the offer, that had put the Poland despite the fact, that they were excluded by the Czechs as possible owners of her/its/their stock exchange earlier. 
Reason for it is that the Warschauer stock exchange fully belongs to the state. 
is 99% of the shares in the hands of the Polish state that wants veräußern the papers in the coming months however more than 60%. 
Comprises the offer of the Poland the until now highest purchase-price, that was ever offered for the Prager stock exchange, after news of the Czech daily " E15 ". 
As the newspaper reports, has the Viennese stock exchange so far, that Nasdaq Transatlantic, that New York put stick Exchange, the London stock exchange and the German stock exchange offers. 
Petr Koblic, boss of the Prager stock exchange said last week, that the Warschauer stock exchange would probably be the worst new owner from all the prospect, and he/it didn't exclude either that that could even lead in future to the shutdown of the Prager stock exchange. 
Market-experts estimate the value of the Prager stock exchange on 5-10 bil. Crowns. 
Loudly agreements of the stockholders could be sold to 90% of the shares. 
Biggest owner the Prager stock exchange is the Patria Finance investment-bank with a 25 percent interest, followed from the Ceská Sporitelna bank with 14,7 and the tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13,5 percent. 
The finance-crisis from the view of European newspapers 
In her/its/their that itself international finance-crisis sharpening on and on dedicated commentaries already spoke some leading European leaves on Tuesday from the " second 11. September ". 
We have the global finance-catastrophe the American president to owe, La Repubblica " thought approximately " - the president has been in the situation not once, his/its own party for the bill behind itself to one, that should bring some relief into the alarming situation,... 
Instead of a " new Pearl Harbor ", like the billion-heavy investor Warren Buffett it named, it would be more appropriate, from a " second 11. , To speak September ". 
Parts the press in Madrid also locates the scapegoat in Washington. 
In the opinion of the " El Mundo " it is to blame the lacking political leadership for it that the world economy is now at the edge of the breakdown. 
The American financial system threatens to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer. 
Bush's plan admittedly was not perfect, now the danger threatens after the vote in the congress however that Washington has no political method to the crisis-management ready. 
The world economy hangs in the air, in fact precisely to a time, since one of the biggest transformations of the history of the capitalism takes place. 
One can disregard the threat no longer, the Genevan " day-It-indicator " thinks approximately. 
Still some states could admittedly make available rescue-packages for their money-institutes gotten into the unsteadiness, and the banks with the money of the taxpayers before the bankruptcy rescue. 
A domino-effect is caused however and even more banks go bust, then neither further finance-splashes, still other urgent measures, help. 
The EU-Mitgliedsstaatens had to long-term would jump over her/its/their shadow and had to would centralize the control over the money-markets. 
On the Monday alone became 100 bil more than EUR. at schwächelnde money-institutes pays off, the standard " reminds the Viennese ". Furthermore, according to the newspaper further, the misgivings are more and more realistically that also the European taxpayers had now to would reach somewhat more deeply after the Americans into her/its/their bags in order to get out of the crisis. 
Up to now, the EC has not given serious thought to the crisis, that now sweeps like a Tsunami over the old continents. 
The " saviors " would not immediately have to hundred billions with several admittedly Euro " waves ", it would be however advisable to hold on in which case it would be sensible to touch the money of the taxpayers in order to turn away an even bigger damage. 
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumble-bee 
What would be the best method to the development of new technologies to the accident-avoidance if to imitate not the obstacle-sensors from the nature? 
For example that of the bees. 
An astonishing project, with which the Nissan-Ingenieures of bumble-bees were inspired new accident of avoiding systems with the creation, was introduced with the CEATEC in Japan. 
In cooperation with the Tokioter university, Nissan has built the biomimetic system of the type BR23C controlled by car-robots, a mini-car, equipped with the qualities of the bees, with the goal to support the development of a system, that each collisions avoid. 
In the flight, each bee forms her/its/their own, oval " privacy ", that our own " shield " is very similar, Kazuhhiro Doi said, product-managers for Technologie-PR and research-development, at the showing. 
The composite eye of the bee, that can see into each direction and in an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role with it. 
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance-knife. 
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a visual field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates her/its/their distances and sends signals at the microprocessor at board, that immediately introduces the collision-avoiding process. 
The obstacle is registered in second-fractions, and the car-robot immediately alters the course, like the movement of the bees, in that he/it turns the tires about the corresponding angle. 
This maneuver takes place purely instinctively in contrast to previous systems. 
" If it was not so, the car-robot could not react declared Toshiyuki Andoh, leaders of the " Mobility Laboratory " and the car-robot-project, sufficiently quickly in order to avoid " the obstacles. 
The system must respond instinctively and immediately since this technology corresponds to the most inner and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer, within the accidents at present still as unvermeidbar is valid. 
The entire process must reflect holding back of the bees if they avoid other bees. 
And that must run out in the fraction of a second. 
However, the evasion, in contrast to the bees, doesn't can up, down, or takes place even diagonally - it can be only two-dimensional, in fact only in direction of the Wendbarkeit of the tires. 
While infinitely many possibilities stand the bees here frankly in order to avoid other bees, the researchers could themselves with the car-robot of only the rotation, respectively the accelerates and brake serves. 
The BR23C contains Lithium-Polymerbatterien, that is easier and energy-more efficient, and a longer lifespan therefore has, as conventional Lithium-Ionenbatterien. 
Andoh explained, it depends on the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less, to store these on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability. 
This appliance must process some inputs per second merely and accordingly on her/it/them must respond. 
It must this doesn't store, or on the basis of former maneuvers an intuitive, logical reaction produces, sodass it continuously merely one handful KB of memory in claim takes. 
It needs no gigabytes - and megabyte-heavy Memories. 
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision-avoidance-technology, that will be after assessment of Nissan within the next ten years in production in series. 
Another application could find the technology with the GPS-Satellitennavigation in that it steers the motorist about obstacles around consciously and leads him/it at the goal so. 
A name for the sündteure child 
The written version of the 700-bil-dollar of heavy Rettungspaket-Gesetzes, that will be to be applied in several stages and aims on the purchase of the bad credits of the banks, is now available. 
In the first passageway, half of the money should be passed out. 
In a session, that came local time East coast on Saturday after midnight to an end, the congresspersons have themselves after several days' debates to an unification over the 700-Milliarden-Dollar severe rescue-packet durchgerungen, Reuters reported. 
" We have achieved " essential advances, Nancy Pelosi said, democratic president in the American deputy-house, and thought, one must only write down the unification. 
The achieved compromise over the rescue-package backed both presidency-candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Finance-minister Henry Paulson thought to the result: The program will show effect and it becomes efficient, one must do even more however. Loudly Pelosi was not it here about the rescue the embankment Street but about it, the rudder of the economy rumzureißen. 
The written setting of the package still became before the opening of the Asian markets, therefore, Washingtoner time Sunday evening 8 o'clock, Central European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning, publishes, has caused no height-flight on the stock exchanges however. 
On Monday, the deputy-house first votes on the bill to the stabilization of the economy of 2008, the senate is next then. 
President George W. Bush spoke on the Saturday evening with Pelosi, and also that white house greeted the news over the unification. 
We are content with the advances achieved in the night and estimate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and to protect our economy, Tony Fratto said, speakers of the white house. 
The program deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush-administration however, after which the 700 bil. Dollar all at once for the purchase lazy, with credits of incriminated investments should be spent. 
In a first tranche, half of the 700-Milliarden-Betrages should be passed out at most, with what 250 bil. it is immediately available after the congress will vote on Monday on the Causa as expected. This sum should be used for the purchase of credit-incriminated, bad investments, and over the further 100 bil. USD should adjudicate the president. 
The program is checked by an individual commission, that also the president of the Federal reserve belongs. 
The other half the 700 bil. depend on another decision of the congress. 
In the sense of the law, the department of Finance can apply also a combined tactic: It can bad credits, mortgages, simultaneously and incriminated investments buy with mortgages, or also other " poisonous " credits. 
How responsible persons of the ministry reported, the purchase can as well as in an auction, as also takes place directly. 
The law makes possible it for the concerned companies to take part in an insurance-program, with which the department of Finance guarantees the worrying methods, and pays the businesses to the too expectant damages corresponding dues. 
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary methods so that up to 700 bil. Dollar as immediately-help for the American financial system to the disposal can be put, be it for the big aimed purchase of bad methods, her/its/their insurance, or the avoidance of a system-risk, that is caused by the collapse of a bigger money-institute. 
We put down the necessary steps so that we are ready to the introduction of the law as soon as it was signed, according to Paulson. 
The bosses of that in difficulties gotten and now on state help dependent banks can calculate with it however that her/its/their dispatches, that are named Golden Handshake ", from which government is shortened, in the overseas-slang careless ". 
There will be a shortening of the salaries only in certain cases, and these shortenings will depend on it as the department of Finance helps out in each case. 
The shortening essentially means that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, according to the " Golden Handshake " is taxed, unless, the finished Bankenchef is pushed into the pension. 
The government will intervene aggressively in the case of a direct purchase of the lazy credits in order to guarantee that the manager-salaries are not exaggerated. 
To the picture, it also belongs that the existing Golden Handshake-Verträges are not altered - the restrictions it refers only to new agreements so that umsos take part more people in the program. 
That is the first case in the American history, that shortenings are regulated with manager-salaries per law, the Democrat Barney wrote a commentary on Frank, chairperson of the finance-committee, the measure. 
The state gains participation-rights the participating banks, sodass the risk for the taxpayers it sinks since they can also participate, as soon as it the economy and with it also the rescued bank again better goes. 
The bill intends that the president must present a suggestion to the congress in the next five years as the taxpayers should get back her/its/their lost money from the finance-sector again. 
There were skeptics, that have expressed her/its/their doubts in reference to the plan, for both sides however. 
That is not that, which the American citizens of us expect, the plan the money of the taxpayers protects on no account, according to the Californian Republican Darrell Issa. 
His/its colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur thought: The measures were advanced by the same persons, who are responsible the embankment also for the collapse Street.

Barack Obamas and John McCain, the two presidency-candidates of the big American parties, have her/its/their support for the 700 bil on Sunday. Dollar heavy rescue-package for banks promised. There are however also politicians, who demand the resignation of the finance-minister. 
The congress and representatives of the government have announced after days-long marathon-advices on Sunday tomorrow that they have come to an unification over the Banken-Rettungspaket. 
The crisis the embankment Street, just as became the unfreezing of the frozen up credit-market to the central questions of the presidency-campaign. 
Obama and McCain - both claims to be been suitable better than the respective opponent in order to lead the country from the depression. 
After youngest surveys, Obama could develop his/its start thanks to the economic-topics further while McCains high, that the presentation of Vice-presidency-candidate Sarah Palin has given him/it after the republican convention, is at the same time there-molten. 
With an election campaign-event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his/its hope that the congress the law over the 700 bil. Dollar heavy package quickly will assume. 
He/it emphasized that comprises also those passages of consumption-duck-protection the plan, that he/it with has supported.

Press-show of the German-language area 
The right camp is intact, only the voters became more self-confidently within the camp - so writes a commentary on " the weak performance of the CSU the mirror " in Bavaria. 
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to the, in order to prevent a red-black coalition, reigns. 
The mirror (spiegel.de) 
In the on-line-edition of the German news-magazine settled left, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons of the dramatic defeat of the CSU exterminated her/its/their fathers " in his/its article " of Bavaria revolution. 
The erosion of the CSU began in the opinion of the renowned political scientist for a long time before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took on his/its offices. 
The Christsozialens have renewed Bavaria over decades - now turns away exactly the modern citizens of them. 
The epoch-break is a problem of the Christian-democracy simultaneously, like also for Angela Merkel. 
Completely surprising didn't come the disaster of the CSU, but on Sunday, something has come to an end which however already began to emerge rather precisely ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state-party 
Because already before ten years, 1998, the CSU lands with 47,7 percent and fell with it since the fifties under the fifty-percent-brand for the first time 
The repeated itself three years ago with the Bundestag-elections 2005, therefore still in her/it many quoted Stoiber-Äras. 
The modernization logically driven by the CSU in the state has exterminated too good last her/its/their own mothers and fathers. 
Sociologists had already predicted that 40 years ago, itself with it however in the speed considerably verschätzt. Could the secularization however without effects, that educational-success, the popularity of east - and North German into the prosperierenden regions of Bavaria on the fidelity of the CSU-voters don't remain. 
Modernization always walks around with option-increase. And that has political consequences. 
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and more headstrong. 
It is showy that the classic citizen-groups virtually expressed the biggest distance to the CSU in the last weeks: the free occupations, the industrial bourgeoisie and voters with high school diploma like college degree. 
Here, the support of the CSU sank on even under 40 percent. 
The press (diepresse.com) 
The conservative Viennese daily reports in her/its/their " who with whom? Party-bosses reservedly in coalition-questions " titled articles over the chaotic domestically situation in Austria after the reelections. 
The SPÖ would like to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The ÖVP prohibits itself the interference of the SPÖ into internal issues. 
The BZÖ points frankly in all directions for conversations while the members of the Greens Party want not yet to commit themselves in reference to a coalition. 
The reelections are past, and now everything rotates around the coalition; in the debates in the legal television let the party-bosses hardly look into her/its/their cards. 
SPÖ-Chef Werner Faymann confirmed his/its wish, with which to want to negotiate ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to show that a cooperation of both parties is possible very probably - in some states and in the socially-partnership is already this the case. 
The question, whether he/it could introduce himself/itself a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the present ÖVP-Chef as vice-chancellors, then, Faymann left frankly. 
As he/it said, the voters would have voted out the Schüssel-Molterer-Kurs. 
A repetition of this direction was not possible. 
Molterer has reacted carefully to red offers meanwhile. 
The cooperation could not be fertile, he/it thought if Faymann tries to interfere with internal concerns of the ÖVP. 
Whether his/its party in opposition, or into the coalition goes, is completely open at present, and these questions should be discussed ÖVP-intern. 
BZÖ-Chef Jörg Haider pointed frankly in all directions. 
" In order to prevent red-black, we are ready to adopt " government-responsibility, according to Haider. 
Járóka: The vicious circle of the poverty and the segregation must become perforated 
Today, the European summit has begun in Paris to the equal opportunity, that is organized from the EU-Ratspräsidentschaftsland France this year. 
In their speech directional at the plenum, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz-Abgeordnete of the European people-party, especially alerted to the educational-segregation, since this one of the most serious infringements, that happen to Roma-Kindern, is, furthermore this is the biggest obstacle for their validity-need. 
The high-ranking conference became from the French Beschäftigungs - and socially-minister Xavier Bertrand in the name of the French Ratspräsidentschaft, and Vladimir Spidla, EC-commissioner for activity, social issues and equal opportunity, opens. 
Among the participants, representatives of governments, the European socially-partners, were just as the most important European legal-protection - and citizen-organizations from the area equal opportunity. 
How the press-office of the EP-Abgeordneten of the Fidesz reports, Járóka has alerted to it that beside discrimination with the Jobsuche, that would primarily be ousted Roma because of her/its/their low educational-level of the labor market. 
" The predominant majority of the Roma-Jugendlichen has no method-education, and thanks to a bad reason-school-education, only a small part of them can reach " a college degree. 
Weiters emphasized Járóka, that formation is a basic human right, that to a key-role was entitled, with the assertion of other human rights. 
The economy of the EU-Mitgliedsstaaten could strengthen investments into the premature education of Roma-Kindern. 
It is important in the opinion of the deputy that itself these contexts an as wide as possible circle - therefore Roma and nicht-Roma - conscious becomes. 
Because ever earlier a Roma student the school begins, umso more strongly climbs his/its chances to turn into the productive member of the labor market; and through earning - and sales tax, they achieve her/its/their contribution to the national editions. 
" As union-citizens, the right must be secured the Romas on qualitatively high-quality formation - the bad and segregated instruction must become " put in - according to Lívia Járóka. 
As the deputy explained, a common is, aims - and action-oriented action of the European union necessary, about which to accelerate Desegregationsprozess on the educational-sector. The correct observance of the existing and planned anti-discrimination-directives is imperative to it. 
" We must break through the vicious circle from poverty, segregation, and unemployment and must give Roma-Kindern the democratic occasion to contribute " to the future of Europe as fully entitled citizens, Járóka demanded. 
Since the congress in Berlin in the last year, the summit is organized annually with the goal, an unique forum for the Voranbringung of the goals of the equal opportunity and discrimination-freedom in European, but also national level, to manage in the sense of the " European year of the equal opportunity ". 
CSU: Mercy on time 
End of Octobers is decided on the fate of the fallen duet of Huber-Beckstein 
No heads still roll despite the election-debacle in the meantime, the personnel-debates were adjourned at the top of the Bavarian CSU. 
Still remains party-boss Erwin Huber and prime minister Beckstein in her/its/their offices, the question is only how long this mercy lasts. 
On the fate of the tandem after the disastrous 17-percent Stimmverlust, one decides at the last October-weekend with the extraordinary convention. 
The much scolded duet let however already understand that it would not like to stick on her/its/their chairs. 
They want to calm down the displeased parliamentary party and the party-basis, that demanded personal consequences a day after the " Bavarian Tsunami " in view of the loss of the absolute majority, with it. 
Five years ago - admitted, under the leadership of the Edmund Stoiber standing at his/its career-climax - still reached the Christian-social union 60,7 percent. Now however, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, they could secure only 43,4 percent of the votes. 
The CSU was Alleinregierer " 46 years long " in Bavaria, that obtains 18 percent of the German BIP. 
The conservatives admittedly remain the decisive strength in the southern state important also for the Hungarian economy, will have to reign in a coalition however henceforth. 
As first sign of the internal party restructurings, Seehofer is tied in the potenzielle successor Hubers, vice-president and Federal-agrarian-minister Horst also into the reconnaissance-team, that with the liberal FDP, respectively the right-wing " wooing Voter " Sondierungsgespräche over a possible Munich coalition leads. 
It equals an irony of the fate that voter " comes in with the list " outside that Gabriele Pauli into the legislature whose Anti-Stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein duet first has ausgenützt, about then the purposeful politician unmerciful to abservieren. 
The CSU-leadership now concentrates all her/its/their strengths on the stabilization Becksteins. 
In this transition-process, Stoiber, that pulled the threads out of the background up to now, will come an active role. Named the 28 the former prime minister and CSU-chairperson. September the " most bitter day of his/its political career ". 
On Monday, Huber made a few poisonous remarks in direction CDU - according to his/its opinion would have earned the CSU much more support of the sister-party. 
Other CSU-politician interpreted the defeat as a signal at the CDU and with it also at Angela Merkel. 
If the CSU, that has contributed much to the success 2005 also on national level, should not be put with a common strength-act on the legs again, Merkel cannot become a chancellor after the Bundestag-elections in September 2009 again. 
Merkel, that has done no secret from her/its/their disappointment over the fiasco, believes that the terrain-loss of the CSU won't have an effect negatively on the big coalition in Berlin. 
What is however relative: The injured CSU won't be easier to reign, and the crisis of the social democrats continues meanwhile. 
With 18,6 percent, the SPD reached her/it/them best result in Bavaria since 1946 up to now. 
Lukaschenko-Opposition: 110-0 
With the elections on Sunday, no deputy of the opposition has made it into the Ukrainian parliament. 
Thinks Russian observers, this is because of the affluence and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukaschenko that OECD suspects however illegalities with the count of the votes. 
The OECD, that has sent out 450 observers from 43 countries, has not acknowledged the elections. 
De legislature of the 10-Millionen-Einwohnerstaates admittedly makes do since decades without opposition. Nevertheless that has hoped itself them/her/it under the name " united democratic strengths " (ODS) of gathered opposing side before the previous elections seriously that Lukaschenko, that already renewed his/its presidency-mandate for the fourth time with the unclean elections and thanks to an amendment 2006, would admit " some deputy of the opposition in the parliament " this time. 
Therefore, the ODS has even taken distance from the boycotts planned before. 
The Ukraine becomes economically ever more dependent thanks to the climbing prices with the natural gas-import from Russia. For the relief of the price-increases, even credits were lifted, and the country has agreed also to the sale of the Beltransgas, the owner of the Gaspipeline leading through the country, at the Russians. In the background of the expectations of the opposition, the hope therefore stood, the Ukraine wants to improve her/its/their relationship with the EC, after Lukaschenko and other high-ranking politicians because of the as anti-democratically classified political system in the EC entry-prohibition has. 
The evaluation-report of the elections of the OECD provided a momentary relaxation, in which sooner the emphasis on the positive movements, instead of on the lacks - like approximately the exclusion one third of the opposition-candidates of the elections - lay. 
However, the quickly-report of the OECD already criticized the campaign on Monday - therefore should not occur opposition in the press - and especially the fact, that the opposition was allowed to be not present with the count of the votes. 
Despite all that, the opposition is able an improvement in the political system recognizes: Political prisoners became approximately sedate on free foot, and Minsk is even ready to smaller confrontations with Moscow in that it still refuses the acknowledgment of the independence of the apostate georgischen provinces South-Ossetia and Abchasien although Russia, with which the Ukraine forms a federal-state on the paper, has considered the two areas for one month independent. 
" We have two steps onward and done one backwards, but the most important is, that the dialogue has begun between Weißrussland and the EC, Alexander Milinkewitsch said to our leaf. 
In the opinion of the opposition-candidate of the presidency-elections of 2006, a continuation is desirable, although " has received the heroic anxiety to let " also only an opposition into the parliament. 
The opposition plans no protest-measures in view of the results but tries the necessity of an economic-reform the voters sooner clear-shuts. 
" We have to fight with many problems here - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us with the distribution stones into the way, but nevertheless I see that people support the change more and more, even the older " - said Milinkewitsch in allusion to it, that not once the most-backed layer of the pensioners agrees with the Lukaschenko-Regime, his single merit is the manufacture of social security. 
" Thanks to the indebtedness of the country and the increase of the trade deficit, it is a question of the time merely, until begins " to crumble the social security " reminding " at the silence of a graveyard, according to Milinkewitsch. 
In contrast to the opposition-politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratic. 
Sergej Lebedev, leader of the mission of the community of independent states explained Ria Novosti to the news agency: " The people believe the actions, and not the words ". The absence of the opposition is therefore a proof for the maturity of the weißrussischen voters. 
Brunetta: " From now is had breakfast " before the work 
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi, there are trick-pure doors for the in - and exits of the officials. 
From today will kick the measure against them/her/it that Schlaumeier in strength, that stamps first and goes Kaffeetrinken during the working time then. 
The new ?Anti-Faulpelz-Gesetz " was introduced to secretary-general of the presidency of the government by Renato Brunetta, the minister for public administration and from Mauro Masi, today. 
" 
" Now, a new era of the responsibility and transparency begins. 
This is reformism ", Brunetta underscores once again. 
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment finishes in all constructions of the presidency of the government. 
Masi thinks to this: " the election of the trick-pure doors is also from big value " symbolically. 
From sides of the officials, there was no resistance, the secretary-general assured: " This process became from all supports, the cooperation came from all sides ". 
It now gives everything in all no breakfast during the working time more therefore; end with Kaffe or croissant. 
Brunettas guesses with a smile relating to this: " A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works miracle ". 
During a convention of the waiter-committee of the public administration, Scuola superior della Pubblica Amministrazione, 
from Rome, the minister announces that the absences of the officials have reduced themselves " within three months to 50%, that is 60.000 persons per year more with the work present is ". 
He/it adds, it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration Italy 
" their wage-dynamics - according to the minister - was double so big in the latter 8-10 year as the privacy and far over the inflation-installment ". 
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have gotten together, about which to work against Brunetta-Dekret in the framework of the appeal backed by Codacons. 
" During the ministers for the public service itself with numbers over more inferior Absenzen with the work defines - so writes the consumer-headquarters - grows the people of that ' transacts Faulpelze' continuously. 
Indeed, thousands correct and valuable officials of the public service have gotten together in order to declare " the war on the false norms of the decree. 
Especially, one fights before the regional administration-court (TAR) for additional financial balances for work-related illness; so becomes also the planned expansion of the compulsory house-arrest of the sick worker-taker, can be done during which control-visits and disputed further aspects of the innovations of the minister. 
Napolitano: " Prevention against work-accidents is crucial " 
Every day, 2500 work-accidents happen in Italy, three persons die and invalids remain 27 for life. 
For the year 2007, the data of the Inail confirm, Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro, namely, that the deadly work-accidents lay with approximately 1200. 
These digits cover the seriousness of a phenomenon, which causes as many deaths as through murders almost doubly, originates. 
Today becomes the Anmil, Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi Del Lavoro, in all provinces of Italy the 58. national day for the victims of work-accidents commits, all the the attention of the social institutions and media, to steer on this dramatic situation. 
" The worrying, from Anmil dispersed data and the tragic news of these days it confirms how decisively the question of the Prävention is " at the job., the president of the republic confirms Giorgio Napolitano in his/its communication at him/it president of the Amil, Associazione nazionale mutilati Ed invalidi Del lavoro, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of state expresses his/its " big esteem for the constant commitment to the Prävention at the jobs, to the protection of the injured workers, to the allowance for the families of the victims and to the sensitization of the public opinion ". 
" An indignant " enough " has risen hereupon; clearly with tragedies, that, measured at her/its/their magnitude, some whirl in the media and sympathy of the public causes. However the everyday reality confronts us with dramatic events, that can even recur in her/its/their momentum, frequently. 
Napolitano doesn't hide that " there is in any case also a resource-problem: it must be invested in formation and piece of information decisively. 
A special meaning assumes the numerous enterprise for a more direct Bewusstwerdung in school-frameworks on the part of the teenager, that nurtures itself the working world. 
It is our duty to direct the attention toward this phenomenon and to distract not from his/its social seriousness. One must put down a legislative norm in strength and must improve. 
For his part, the president of the chamber of Gianfranco Fini has emphasized " an urgent social emergency like the phenomenon of the work-related deaths forms, which the conscience of us all offends and all institutions to it forces to to-work on decided rules, that the goal has, the problem to put down " an end. 
" The data of the work-accidents seem to signal an easy improvement, this doesn't exclude however, that the number of the work-related deaths is " too high much, president of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli, emphasizes. 
" We would not like that this " positive tendency " of less attention means. Exactly the causes the tragedy " in the end. 
" As believes, that one undertakes in reason too little in order to confront the phenomenon of the accidents. One can fight through different actions against it. 
Stronger controls and inspections are after necessary of our opinion? according to Mercandelli; however also stronger measures to the enlightenment of the workers, that already begins " in the school. 
" Another effort is necessarily - so adds he/it - what the communication and the sensitization of the public opinion concerns. 
But in particular a bigger responsibility-feeling of sides of the employers is a phenomenon, that represents a social emergency, opposite asked ". 
Mercandelli came to speak on it also on " the onward deterioration of the protection in behalf of the work-casualties " and denounced the " abolition of the social system, against which we battle " in the last years. 
" The goal is it consequently to return a guarantee on insurance to the worker-taker so that the fate of the victim of a work-accident doesn't become " dependent on voluntary or accidental donations, that are adjudicated by time by a legislator at the moment. 
Mp3-Player under accusation: Danger of hearing-damages 
, To hear pure music over a longer span with wearable music-appliances, like for example Mp3-Player, can lead to permanent hearing-damages. 
This reports the European commission, which quotes the opinion of the Csrseri, scientific committee over the current and recently identified Gesundheitsrisiken, the EC in a report dispersed today in Brussels. 
" From the report? so, it is called in a comment? it becomes clear that 5-10% of the one, that hear pure music with wearable music-appliances five years long weekly longer than a hour on the day at least, risk " the lasting loss of her/its/their hearing. 
" I have worries that damages " a so big number of teenagers, that usually wearable music-appliances and Handys put on a high volume, irretrievably to know her/its/their hearing without it, according to Meglena Kuneva. 
" From the scientific results? so, it is called on the part of the Eu? appear a clear risk, that pushes too fast action. 
What really counts, it is to be sensitized the consumers and to do these information to common property. 
We must check the already existing control-systems in view of these scientific realizations again so that they are completely effective and hold " step with the new technology. 
Brussels had engaged the independent scientific committee in view of the dispersed utilization of the wearable music-appliances under teenagers. 
" The scientists - so closes the communication of the EC - confirms, that one is to properly concerned and that the Eu commission with the other Eu-Mitgliederns and the concerned will now examine the necessary measures together, about children and teenager better before the noise, that comes from wearable music-appliances and similar appliances, to be able to protect. 
An European norm, that restricts the level of the noise of wearable music-appliances on 100 dBs, already exists in the moment. The apprehension over the damages, that could come from a too big sound-burden. 
One can limit these damages, into which one reaches to solutions like the reduction of the volume and the length of the sound-abandonment, very much. 
In her/its/their report, the scientific committee of the Eu points out it that, if the users of wearable music-appliances only five hours the week loud, louder than 89 decibels, music hears, so that the lawful borders, that are valid respecting the maximum sound-level at the job, are already overstepped. 
The ones, that overstep music this border, risk the complete loss of the hearing within from five years. 
That would therefore involve 5-10% of the users of such appliances, whose number on between 2,5 and 10 millions persons in the Eu can be estimated. 
Roma, Alemanno gives the start-shot to the " commission for the future of the capital " 
We start today, in March soll's past is, in June, things is summed up. 
That is the course fixed by the Capitol for the works of the " commission for the future of the capital Rome ". The commission has met morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla-Thermen today. 
In six months, the president Marzano and the further 49 members of the commission will work out the leadership-lines for Rome. 
As soon as the project will be completed, becomes the city - and the district council the analyses and projects, in order to be in June in the situation, assesses the strategic plan equipped to be able to introduce for Rome with the " official stamp " of the Capitol and the Mayor Gianni Alemanno. 
" The commission is absolutely independently and all political, social and cultural views are held " in her/it/them, - emphasizes Alemanno. " She/it will offer suggestions for a development plan for Rome, his politically responsible of the city - and the district council remains. 
No redistribution of responsibilities, only the will, exists to have a place, at which one can develop a big project for Rome. 
In March, her/its/their task will be finished and the commission will dissolve again since one such project must have a timewise certain final point. 
In June - so announces the Mayor - will introduce the strategic plan, in which we will use the work achieved by the commission, we. 
Whoever puts the area of authority of the commission in question, since their opinion lacks at obligingness, the replies Alemanno: " Everything hangs from the work which the commission will achieve and from the quality of her/its/their suggestions, from. 
If she/it, just like in France the Attali-Kommission, quality-full results delivers? and this will be the case in Rome surely? then, her/its/their contribution will be fundamental. 
Too often, the politics devotes time to the everyday problems and emergencies, that appear from time to time. 
We, against it, want to have a longer time period in the gaze, all the with in a deeper perspective seriously at the development of Rome and the future of the city works ". 
The Mayor Roms attaches much value to it to specify " following this commission, an useless equipment, another wreck, is neither: she/it is absolutely free, she/it will cost the Roman citizens no cent and she/it will bring us to the reflection. She/it will employ " the best heads of the capital. 
Loudly Alemanno " it is necessary to possess a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static, around our city a quality-jump - him/it she/it truly necessary has -, to enable, and, to do " such a common step into the future. 
A future, according to the Mayor Roms, that " limits itself not only in the current local-borders, but much further will look, not only regarding the role of Rome as metropolis and political capital of Italy but also as future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean ". 
Obama? the first anti-American president? Here an explanation 
A known American politician, whom much cares about it, than to be looked at independently, has written: " Barack Obama becomes the second anti-american president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, that through his/its decisions, the economy of the USA decimated and that looked after relationships with the hostile to Islam and this still today as private-man toots." 
The attacks against Obama become ever more vehement, exactly now, where the elections approach. 
A lady from Miami has written in an Internet side: " This person is full ambitions. 
Obama is very fresh: he/it thinks he/it is gotten the highest office of a nation, the altogether two black governor and five black senators has seen!. 
Actually, these attacks have not much to say however; it is about racist attacks and she/it doesn't answer the question of the voters: will he/it be a good president? And then there are also the surveys; all it says that Obama will win with a big start. 
Also in this case, people are there, that with him/it heart and speaks not with the head. 
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the united states, has in her/its/their in the Editorial written: we will probably know only in the voting booth to whom the real American patriot will give his/its voice. 
A mentality of the USA to the light, that hides up to last, comes become hold here. 
" Say, what you want, then we will adjudicate for whom we will do our Kreuchen, whether for Obama or for McCain ". 
People, that swear, are there: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America. 
Something, which they heard never before? only now, where the success of the black so certainly seems candidate. 
By all means, despite all of these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush. 
1500 persons were questioned: Which mistakes has Bush committed during his/its term of office? 89% have answered: the war in the Iraq. 
America changes. 
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent with a step into the rear end again home. 
In the Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost her/its/their life and the Americans were not forced to pack. 
Nevertheless, the Iraq remains the weak-point of Bush for the majority. 
The one, that will occupy his/its position, is faced with a gigantic task. 
USA. The financial breakdown leaves his/its tracks also with journalists: In the newspapers, one can already sense the shortenings. And many accuse the Internet, the " murderer " of the printing press. 
Five hundred American journalists became the future from the PEW Research Center over her/its/their situation and her/its/their mentale control concerning questions. 
Today is almost all journalists pessimistically something her/its/their future concerns. 
Nevertheless, they didn't explain the information opposite that concerning responsible because of the general credibility truly anxiously. 
You/they feel not as alone as early. 
The problem for the American journalists is the money. 
The crisis of 2008 is a crisis of an economic model, that was destroyed, for these journalists. 
To it, the big problems are caused by the shortenings apt the Newsroom, therefore the area, in which the editors work, in order to compose the newspaper. 
It is about a problem, that must be solved? according to the interviewed journalists? if one wants to prevent that the traditional journalism, not essentially how the big public understands him/it, shrinks. 
A clear, though complicated pessimism fills the American journalist today. 
Six of ten journalists and Executive of senior of the printing press are of the opinion that the journalism is on national level in the wrong way. 
In the local area, it is even with the Executiveses at the 65%. 
Printed vs. Broadcast. 
It is not difficult for the journalists to introduce itself/themselves into which direction the Web goes. 
The most important publishing house-groups clear themselves the way into the Internet, that is regarded by many as the " killer " of the printing press. 
The " economic pressure ", that the journalists sense, is about up to 79% climbed. 
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted, itself the new technology, to want to connect, in the hope " she/it brings something good for the journalism ". 
The biggest rip consists of the American journalism between the chief editors of the newsroom and the reporters, who work for her/it/them, today. 
56% of the chief editors on national level is sure itself, her/its/their reporters divide her/its/their values with them while it is only 23% on local level. 
Some think, it has to do with the " security in the work ". 
The managers, who are afraid, to lose her/its/their work within three years amount to 47% on national level. 
With the journalists, it is 30%. 
The topic of the " certain work " in the team, our " editors ", comment d. Speak.) a current topic is always in the USA. 
Only 13% of the journalists work under contract. 
In a gigantic nation, as it is the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio - and TV-stations and Internet-Betreibern, the employers offer them liked like it and so it becomes leave a question of take it or it. 
The chief editors very often receive very high wages, the editor against it can occasionally only 10000 Euro per month receives, to it pensions - and insurance-moneys. 
What concerns the vacation, so the matter is complicated: a certain quantity of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, in order finally to reach 15 vacation-days after a certain number of years. 
But the American journalists become as they themselves admit, in the course of the year frequently " sick ". 
It is a question of the climate. 
UNIPOL: COURT IN THE ROM: DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA 
The president of the second criminal-chamber of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to refuse the proposition of the real estate-broker. This had asked therefore to be transferred by Grottaferrata to Rome. 
It becomes against Coppola because of Bankrot in the framework of the examination over the counter-agreement in the case of the takeover of Unipol-Bnl. determine. 
In the course of the process against him/it during the letzen week, his/its dismissal was changed from the house-arrest into a stay-duty in Grottaferrata. 
His/its lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked therefore to license the real estate-broker to be transferred from the province-city into an apartment in the capital. 
According to the court, publishings could him/it that sort of thing against which had been pronounced the public prosecutor's office, that possibility gives, to influence his/its society and at him/it accused evidence to reach. 
The elite is in danger 
The phenomenon had already revealed itself before some days, as the deputy-chamber against the 700 Milliarden-Dollar-Sparpaket of the white house was correct: A deep slice of the Americans was and is interested at it more, that to punish Street embankment to rescue as the economy. 
This confirms the yesterday's edition the New York of Time, that tells about it, how the crisis in the trot divides the republican party, that forks more and more, into her/its/their old and moderate east Coast-Seele that always favored the state institutions and them/her/it business community and that neokonservative, that " faces those in Washington " and the finance-world adversely and wins V. A. in the south and the center of the states voters. 
This part of the party owes his/its ascent to V. A. of the voice his that I mentioned above. 
This example mentioned just is only a small part of the big changes, that the momentary economic earthquake announces or even already represents, meanwhile: not only in the USA, also in the entire west and maybe also over this will be concerned from these. 
As well as in the states also as in Europe seems the crisis to accelerate the events feared long, which finally assumes shape under these new conditions and comes at the light. 
The first of these phenomenons is the Neuentdeckung, the outrageous renaissance of the state in connection with a type Renationalisierung of the economy. 
Indeed the crisis means a decline of the bank - and finance-institutions which narrow connections possess to the foreign countries and administer an immense quantity of the fortunes of private house-holds, that lives in one single state, at the same time. 
This means an immediate political problem for the governments: namely like it itself opposite the concerned families too restrained which represent also a vast voter-mass is valid. 
The crisis appears therefore economically globally, politically against it she/it is almost purely national. 
The political internationalism seems gotten at itself into the offside so to be and to have lost his/its speech-right: The plausible proof for this has been given by the EC, which knows to find no common way on the basis of her/its/their division into different national and international conflicts. 
Therefore, all now reckon with the intervention of the own state; rescue-plans, new rules, and V. A. distribution of support-funds: Since the crisis became more and more seriously, the USA are to be escaped merely in the economic layer without foreign help. 
And beside the methods, they possess in addition also the legitimation to use these: consequently two not to überwertende prerequisites? under certain circumstances?, will be able to fall back no international organization and no market in similar manner on which normally probably. 
Besides, that new emphasis, that is put on the state-national element, is in perfect unison with the ever bigger meaning, that is brought sector in connection in the economy with one on the narrowest relation recently,: the Territorialität. 
It is exactly now paradoxical manner as we were so confident from it however to have entered a connected total-empire long ago, into an empire of the always varied technologies, the immaterial, that we must determine all at once, as our future will depend on the essentially material things however more and more: Water, harvest and oil. 
These can admittedly be transported all of a place at the other of the world certain, is however nevertheless connected on most outer with a narrowly altered piece of earth? a territory. 
Therefore, the one, that owns such a territory, is with respect to another, that in a harvest-unproductive, water-draws lots or from Ölvorkommen woos area lives, in the advantage. 
I now come to the second newness, that presupposes a short in-thrust however. 
Whoever says territory, who government, who politics says also Leadership with it. 
In this sense, the finance-crisis seems to generate two convergent phenomenons. 
On the one hand the knowledge is there respectable Leaderships, therefore the need after somebody, that knows, about the necessity as one regulates the things. 
On the other side, a wave of the indignation now insists over the existing leaderships, V. A. those of the economics, which have turned out as inadequate and full shadow-zones. 
To it, a deep enough finally comes and in certain sense even worrying aspect: A trust-loss, an intolerance, a picture of the inexpediency, a feeling of the distance, that turn altogether towards a whole class of managers of the western countries. 
It seems to itself the conviction so to clear the way under big sharings of the population that not it first the actions of the social elite but already her/its/their idea-world, her/its/their Way of Life, her/its/their culture in the widest sense of the word, is, whose salary itself the majority as more and more strangely and come over represents. 
The demand after Leadership nurtures one branched, however mighty movement of the Entmachtung of the leading class and the conventional political establishment therefore underground. This manifestiert itself in unforeseen " revolts " of the voters and in the sudden reversal of the collective nature-condition of the last time: beginning with the ascent of the conservative in Austria and Bavaria, over the breakdown of the Labour-Partei in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American deputy against Bush and maybe also the victory of the rights plays a role in Italy here. 
One wins the impression, as has the old elite, her/its/their parties, her/its/their programs, but also her/its/their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say her/its/their format, more and more understanding-problems and therefore less representative value respecting his, what goes on in the low social layers of the west nowadays and still reinforces from the finance-crisis and until is driven to the Überdimensionalität. 
Countenance's all his would simply be it exaggerated to speak of a " rebellion of the masses ". 
It certainly is not meanwhile to hold the eyes far however frankly. 
The super-glue, that lets rise at walls, 
, To defeat the strengths of the gravity thanks to a glue, and walls, to be able to high-climb, like Superman. 
This is the object of four American research-centers, from which a now seemingly almost at the goal has arrived. 
With a glue found on a surface of only 2,5 qcms, the researchers have succeeded with it, a 100 kg severe flesh, to fix on a vertical wall. 
That STUDIO? an American magazine has, institutes have the results of the researchers of the university of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia of Technology and Force Research Laboratory publishes the aura. 
The material fictional from the researcher-team is a development the glue used already, which a special carbon-structure, named Kohlenstoff-Nanoröhrchen, uses. 
One can imagine " " the principle of the glue like a row to a stack spaghetti angeordneter tubes, Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia explains of Technology to institute in Atlanta. 
The scientists could be inspired from that feet of the Geckos, which are covered from microscopic Härchen, that gives the animal a perfect hold. 
The tests enforced with different materials like glass of teflon and Schleifpapier have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger, as the hold-ability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time " easily from the wall, according to Liming Dai, has " removed researchers of the faculty for engineerings of the university of Dayton. 
AT WALLS ENTLANGWANDERN? " This material could be put in as transient glue, Liming Dai adds. 
, In order to upwards-go approximately like Spiderman at walls? Maybe already, however the researchers think of a less fascinating benefit, like approximately the connection of electric appliances, sooner because the Nanoröhrchens are leaders of heat and electricity as well. 
Wide application-areas could fall into the area of the space travel. 
The super-heroes must therefore still wait for the moment. 
THE OTHER TYPE OF THE RESEARCH? also the university of Berkeley, California, devotes itself to a new glue-type. 
In an article of the American Chemical high society, the Californian scientists present a glue from micro-fibers that itself like hair through movement on a surface itself of the dust cleans and always protects a perfect liability through it. 
Drugs: earn with fruit juice never 
Caution before grapefruit -, oranges - and apple-juice. 
These beverages, which are consumed on the basis of her/its/their cooling quality and her/its/their vitamin-rich-hood's V. A. in the summer, can evoke serious health-damages if they are occupied with certain vital medications at the same time since they can have an effect on the reception this through the body in extreme manner. 
David Bailey, professor of the University of western Ontario in London, reminds on the risk packed like also fresh fruit juices in connection with Medikamenteneinnahme repeatedly. In the framework of the 236. Meetings of the American Chemical high society in Philadelphia beat he/it renewed alarm: It suffices one glassful of apple -, oranges - or grapefruit-juice in order to reduce the capacity of certain vital medications generally that this practically is eliminated and the health of the patients was endangered so. 
Grapefruit-juice was already under suspicion to be responsibly for it, the effects of some medications like antibiotics, Antiasthmatika, heart-cycle-medications, anxiolytischer and neurological methods, until to increase to toxic levels. 
MEDICATIONS IN DANGER? The same agency of the drug had warned in a report of two years of doctors and patients before the dangers of this mix, and what is drunk in connection with methods like approximately Diazepan or Metadon emphasizes to keep an eye on it. 
IT IS NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT? According to the experts, also orange juice and apple-juice contain substances, which can hinder the drugs. 
The list the active substance self-conscious by the fruit juices is long. 
Therefore the appeal of Michele Carruba, the director of the Università Statale di Milano,: " Such results are usually immediately referred at the different international manufacturers, whom it free-stands so, to alter the consumer-information. 
Therefore, it recommends itself always to read the packet-supplement and, if obscurities still pass a pharmacist or doctor to have no fear to ask ", the expert of the Ansa-Agentur emphasizes. 
Economic-Nobel prize goes at Paul Krugman 
The economic-Nobel prize is at the American Paul Krugman for his/its analysis of trade-patterns and the settlement of economic activities. 
The 55 year old Krugman is a Neokeynesianer that teaches at the university of Princeton and known for his/its regular articles for them/her/it New York of Time. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of that economic - and foreign politics of the Bush-administration. 
Few months after the attacks of the 11. September 2001, during the days of the Enron-Zusammenbruchs, had claimed Krugman in an editorial the New York of Time, this second event has been more crucial than the assassinations for the history of the USA. 
A prognosis, that not little polemic got as answer and was still reproached years the economist later, itself today however as completely right proves. 
" I am surprised and also shocks over it, as quickly is " missing the memory at the scandals in the framework of the breakdowns of Enron or Worldcom from the public view, declared Krugman end of 2002. 
Loudly Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the executive-committee of the European central bank is Krugman a " economist of big value ", however also a Banalisierer with a " very aggressive style, who is aimed " particularly at the excessive liberalism of the Bush-government. 
Open Office, the third version of the " Anti-Microsoft"-Pakets appears 
The day of the publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source software wins an ever bigger number at Usern, as well as at home also as in the office, as well as under freelance also as in the public administration, as free substitute for Microsofts Office. 
After one year of intensive work through the voluntary developers which is overseen by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now appears with some newness the public: beside one revised and now Spartan shaped initially-menu, an entirely guaranteed compatibility is now reached with Apples operating system Mac OS x finally, just as the support for the new ODF (Open Document format) 1.2 qualities, therefore the newest Standard-ISO version, given. 
Watch against became 2007 on the compatibility with Microsofts Office furthermore, his new formats, .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, through OpenOffice can be read. 
Also some new features, approximately that, that it allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, are interesting which sending relieves via enamel for example. Counts to this to import also the possibility PDF files in chart-treatment-modules and to protect the original appearance of the side at the same time. 
So, also " hybrid " PDF-Dateiens, which widen the typical chart of the Adobe-Formats about the elements of a table and a word processor, can now be generated. 
The cooperation is her/it one at the most strongly improved element of the applications: Tables now can more-hand is processed from different Usern, through which conflicts are avoided with changes,; in the Fall des word processor is assigned a Frabe to each adapter in order to guarantee such a better correction-method. 
Some companies are exactly at the moment publishing different functions of OpenOffice in the Internet, on the cloud, while the definitive result should be done in the coming weeks public. 
The Italian version stands on following link by the download to the disposal: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Consequently, she/it follows the English version, that is since Friday on the mirrors. 
Besides for Windows and Mac OS is available the program also for the operating system Linux. 
On inquiry, one can itself the Installations-CD home or has sent into the office. 
If the free-ness can be an incentive for the spread of the Programmes in the private house-holds meanwhile, so it is also exactly in the area of the business where OpenOffice could succeed the big throw: finally, different facilities have already moved on the public administration and schools to OpenOffice. 
Actually there is a lack of a Trainings-Angebot not once which an optimal help means for small and middle businesses, and consequently even business-outlooks opens. 
OpenOffice consists from five main-components: Writer, that Word corresponding Texterstellungsprogram; Calc, that Tabellenprogram, which aims at a repression of Excel,; Impress, to the preparation of presentations like with Powerpoint; Dbase to driving data bases at position of the knowner Access; and finally Draw, a chart-module. 
The objective for the year 2008 is it to reach 5 million downloadses? a goal, that with already now also reached 3 million and 600 thousand can be exceeded easily. 
Also cabbage positively tested and with it the fourth Dopingfall 
It opens a new Dopingfall mi frameworks of the bygone tour de franc: it is cabbage of the team about the Austrian athlete Bernhard Gerolsteiner, that as Drittklassifizierter and winners of the jersey of the best climber. 
The message published the daily L'Equipe on her/its/their Webseite. 
The 26-year old cabbage of the team of Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver, that positively on Cera, that Epo of the third generation, was tested. Before, this already applied with the Italienern Riccardo Riccòs and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher. 
The analyses from the blood samples of cabbage belong to those, which were transacted lot-Anna and Chatenay-Malabry in the last weeks of the laboratories. 
If the crosschecks now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his/its third place and is excluded for two years of the races. 
The boss of the French Antidopingkommission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive Epotest, and informs also the Austrian responsible according to the Associated Press. 
The 26-year old Austrian climbed behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans on the stage and claimed furthermore also the jersey of the best climber for itself. 
TOPIC IMMIGRATION: THAT NEW YORK OF TIMES FRAGT: IS ITALIEN RASSISTISCH? 
Italy, " the former country of the emigrants has turned " one since short that to bevorgten countries for immigrants, which are lifted only with going against. 
Does this do a nation of racists from the Belpaese? This asks them/her/it New York of Time in a long article that is dedicated the topic of the racism in Italy completely and from the case of the young, from Burkina Faso of stocky Abdul William Guibre goes out that was murdered one month ago in Milan after he/it had stolen a packet cookie. 
The case testifies to that, which calls " them/her/it Time paradox of the north,: the northern regions are those, of which " integration and work-possibilities " consist the most, and are nevertheless " " the highest degree to record sentiments and the biggest support of the Lega Nord at anti-immigrationistischen. 
As confirmation of the growing tension refers them/her/it of Time between Italienern and immigrants to further episodes of the intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
And not only this. 
Also the new, through which Lega becomes brought in legislation against immigration and to the faster expulsion of the illegal immigrants, as signs of the climate-change in Italy quoted. 
A movement, which also the pope and the president underscore,: " Giorgio Napolitano asked the pope with a meeting on the Quirinal for a cooperation between church and state to the fight of the racism ". 
Students victims that up to 900-Euro per rooms of high Mietspreise 
The market for apartments for students knows no crises. 
According to the last examination of the Sunia, the tenant-union, a single room can a student up to 900 Euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome costs. 
" This phenomenon has already assumed very serious trains. Total flocks of students, so actually to study her/its/their right, it loses, since her/its/their families are not the responsible of the Sunia capable ? sos to support " her/it/them in this height, Laura Mariani ? "in these cities leads the big demand on the part of the students to a deformation of the market, that has damaged also the other inhabitants. 
Moreover, most Mietangebotes comprise a row of violations: free contracts, lacking registrations, without rent-border, forbidden subleases. 
For the Sunia, the necessity exists after exceptional measures, which lead through an overwork of the taxation to lower rents. 
With more exact contemplation of the examination turns out that approximately in Milan a roost in the quarter Brianza 450 Euro is required; a single room begins with 650 Euro, in the quarter of gangs Nere, and finishes with 800 Euro in the quarter Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or cooks 900 Euro in the quarter Vittoria. 
In Florence, a roost costs on average 350/400 Euro, a room 700. 
In Bologna, where the students concentrate in the quarters around the university, 250/280 are Euro for a roost of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room. 
In Rome, the prices lie in the quarters around the university with approximately 600 Euro for a single room, 450 for a roost in a double room. 
The rents are only little deeper in the quarters around the other universities of Rome: 550 Euro in Ostiense and Cinecittà. 
Only whoever avoids in outside-districts, money can save: 300 Euro for a roost and 450 Euro for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarterses. 
In Naples, one requires 300-450 Euro for a roost, for a room, the price lies between 400 and 600 Euro in the most expensive quarters, that Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei. 
In Bari, a roost costs 250-350 Euro, a single room at least 350. 
In the smallest cities, the prices are lower, however they have a bigger weight in the urban economy. 
In the cities, in which the phenomenon of the rental is more frequent at non-European students, as approximately in Perugia, even another anomaly exists: a lease, that lies about 25-30% over the average, is demanded by foreign students. 
Good-by to the old cinema Paradiso? the cities close her/its/their historic cinema-halls 
The historic cinemas close on the basis of the favored Multiplexkinos. 
" A city without cinema-halls is a blind city, like a face without eyes ". 
This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes something in the big urbane centers of Italy, and also in the provinces, with effect momentarily happens. 
The process of the Ausgrenzung of the cinemas, that began with the birth of the big multi-hall-complexes in the periphery, means the death for the in-hall-cinema in the center for the long term. A process, that appears not only inevitably and irrevocably, but also the trains of a cultural crime carries. 
Usually historic places are concerned full of memories, " it is to be lost like a friend, with which one has put back a piece of street full of emotions, according to the director of the film " Nuovo Cinema Paradiso ", that brought in him/it the Oskar and the big price of Cannes 20 years ago. It is about the history of a suburb-cinema and his nostalgia, which consist of it, probably to live in one for always lost cinema-world. 
The numbers, which the Anec, the central trade-association delivers, clearly speaks one language: has had to lock the immense quantity of 316 traditional cinemas into the last five years; this mine paid the cinemas to the biggest part in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
To that at the most strongly effected region, the Emilia-Romagnas belong with 82 lost cinemas, followed from the Tuscany with 44 and the Lombardei with 41. 
This testifies to it, that the Hauptschuldigens are the Multiplexkinos, because exactly these three regions, in which the biggest number of these modern cinemas was registered, are it: with 195 in the last 5 years, the Lombardei quotes the cunnings, 81 are it as well as in the Tuscany also as in the Emilia-Romagna. 
" The business has developed " in an irrational manner, according to Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, " it is admittedly useful, that also new structures emerge, however at first position the already existing the receipt stands, then a hall locks into the city, all his/its patrons are not ready instead of looking the old for a Multiplexkino in the periphery. 
And here, the lacking budget still remains outer eight for the back of the trade-association: the indebtedness charted by the state amounts to 10 millions approximately Euro. 
It is a disgrace of the ethical-moral point of view that the government doesn't heed the existing laws. 
In order to get the sector would be between 16 and 18 millions Euro in the year of needs ". 
The case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which has decided on the basis of the fears around the old cinema-halls, is interesting to protect these through an agreement between the community and the Anec; it is about the first agreement of this type in Italy, that aims at it, to protect the traditional cinemas and to support, and this as well as in the historic center, as also in the periphery. 
Under the foreseen measures, also fiscal Bevorteilungens are for the cinema-operators as well as advantages for the public respecting that of local traffic: it will be allowed to drive into the traffic-limited areas of the center and to park to more favorable park-dues furthermore. 
" It is a pleasant initiative ", according to Giuseppe Tornatore, " I hopes, that other cities will affiliate our example and draft in addition as well new concepts. 
Certain however requires also a better we audio - and video-production, to be able to organize about something against the superpower of the Multiplexsäle, because the public is finally from today selective. 
The defense of the traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the shutdown of the " Supercinema " of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point, that brought me to it, that " to establish Nuovo cinema Paradiso ", even if I had already toyed since 10 years with the idea. 
For 25 years, I have lived in Rome; if I pass by at the Rialto or at the Quirinale in the via of Nazionale, there, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I rotate to the side in order to have to see not the dust-covered posters. 
The connections between politics and ' Ndrangheta leads to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro 
" The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready, the decisions of the community the interests of the Mafia-group Piromalli, to adapt,.. 
The accusations of the bar of the anti-Mafia-authority Kalabriens against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his/its replacement Rosario Schiavone of the community Gioia Tauro, that was arrested morning because of entanglement in Mafia-businesses today, is serious. 
In handcuffs was taken also Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, just as his nephew: the lawyer, which carries the same name like the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced for entanglement into criminal unions of the Mafia, at that time to a compensation-sum of 10 millions Euro. 
So the lawyers write disregarding " " each type of moral and legal norm, the two local administrations had decided, the lawyer, to pay " Piromalli moneys for advice-activities. 
" Consequently, it had been made possible for the Mafia-group? according to the judges? in official way to penetrate into the town halls and to have a say " the politics of the public administration. 
The president of the regional committee of Kalabriens Agazio Loiero doesn't negate that it is all other in his/its region " than an exception to come " upon connections of local administrations and the organized crime. There are places, in which the concentration of the Mafia bigger than is in others, in which such connections are practically inevitable. 
But there are also pub-politicians, that the pressure of that ' Ndrangheta resists: Heroes, that a white vest gets " itself. 
The arrests of today morning follow those of the last July, with which was decapitated according to the police the clan Piromalli. 
Since end of the last April, the district council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, however already 1991? and also at that time on the basis of alleged connections between organized crime and the local administration? the local politicians of her/its/their community-offices had been relieved. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, at that time mayors of the Udc, has been chosen the middle-legal-coalition to the head after the deciding ballot of the May 2006. 
He/it yelled scandal as the prefecture the dissolution of the district council anordnete. 
He/it prosecuted on it into the vice-secretary of the Interior Marco Minniti, that he/it accused, to have invented everything for political-strategic reasons. The judges explain in the context with the warrant of today morning however that the Piromalli-Clan had even dared to apply for an alteration of the A3-Projektes. 
From an Abhöraktion in the context with the examinations to the case Dal Torrione, the willingness has appeared to come towards the wishes of an entrepreneur that a representative of the big group is about the Piromalli as is known ? wodurch the measures of the public administration identically with the interests this clan became ". 
If the energy originates from from the waves, the big accumulate suddenly 
It is a not drying up money-source which covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and only now seems this, to comprehend the big energy-companies of the world. 
Waves, currents and tideses are now the new renewable sources of energy on them/her/it all looks, and also to occupy seeks, approximately giants like Chevron. 
The possibility to win energy from the movements of the sea has already been moved for 70 years in consideration and has been examined; not by chance intensified itself these studies since the first petroleum-crisis considerably. 
As the price of the oil broke in about 1980, one gass the idea of the Meeresenergie, now however the environment-organizations and the climbed Ölpreis press for new impulses in this sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world-wide energy needs of the energies generated through the ocean-waves could be covered. 
This would equal the double of that through nuclear power plants of produced energy momentarily. 
To it, the currents and tideses would furthermore still come. 
Giants with the attack. 
The first company, that now favors the Meeresenergie, is Enersis, that has signed a contract in the year 2005 to the erection of a power plant in the north of Portugal. 
As this message was published it seemed to be about a revolutionary step. 
Two years later, it is now companies from the traditional energy-industry, that puts energy-extraction on the navy, more and more. 
" Chevron examines these technologies "? according to the speaker a the US-American giant of known business in the embankment Street journal? and weigh up the possibility to work together " with us. 
It is about the procurement of an admission of the American energy-commission, that is necessary, on this occasion in order to start a project before the coast of Alaska. 
This is a not too underestimating sign, V. A. if one considers, that oil is still promoted exactly in Alaska through the USA and President Bush put down the plans first for new Bohrungen in walk recently. 
Besides Chevron, also the companies Verdant power Inc. are power from New Jersey, that invests into the new industry, from New York and Ocean; is not known also the details, so observers speak of a climbing interest however. 
Still improvement-worthy technologies. 
Experts still speak themselves of one in the departure deciding technology, this not finally, since the last doubts of sides of the environmentalists are not yet clarified. 
Until now, projects are like that in Portugal and also Scotland of rather small dimension and seems no to cause seriously to taking ecological problems. 
In order to produce however energy in big standard, it needs technologies with much bigger influence on the environment. 
There are different possibilities: Ocean power for example uses a system of together interconnected buoys. 
The thrust of the waves, which the buoys on and moves down, is changed within the swimmers over pistons and cylinders in hydraulic pressure. 
This drives a turbine, which drives a generator on the other hand. 
The stream is sent to it over underwater-managements to the coast. 
So far, there is four schemed enclosures of this type, which only wait for the state authorization. A part of the won energy could serve also for military facilities. 
Verdant power already produces energy for a merchandise-department store and a park-bib with the help of submarine turbines in the east River of New York meanwhile. 
The water-movements during the tideses drives the turbines, which eat the generator through the emerging rotation. 
Loudly Verdant waits already to use a long snake of possible clients on the necessary Autorisierungens about these sources of energy. 
First the waves, then the tideses. 
A particular interest deserved according to the institute for stream-extraction-research momentarily the Potenzial, which is in the tideses. 
Albeit it is also about an irregular phenomenon, the tideses are vorhersagbars as wind-currents, the sun-no-radiation and also the waves, however better and therefore a more trustworthy stream-source. 
Exactly the tides-energy is it, which federal states like New York, Maine and Alaska as well as wide coastal-states to it already to invest 7,5 million dollars in the year 2008 brought? is already planned for 2009 up to 35 millions.
