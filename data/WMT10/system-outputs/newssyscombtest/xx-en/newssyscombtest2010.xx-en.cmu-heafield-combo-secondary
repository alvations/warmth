The lack of snow in the mountains the hotel
Scneelose runways Sorgenn not only The giant mountains residents.
The lack of snow discourages people to book their stays in hotels and pensions.
It is always possible to find free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year.
We have many visitors in our pages.
The People go through the offers, asking prices, but dare not commit to reserve for the moment.
And if they call, they ask immediately if there will be snow or mud at Christmas he mentioned the operator of the information portal Spindl. Info, Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend the New Year of his dreams to Špindlerův Mlýn, should not hesitate more in reserve stay.
Those who prefer to save money and that the quality of accommodation in second place, which can try to wait a few more days.
The hotel of Špindler offer for the moment that stays a week for the New Year.
I think that they will seek to sell them for a while, but they also and accept shorter periods.
And then the free rooms will be quickly, estimated Jandura.
Ingotours, a travel agency in Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all periods of winter.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
In our offer is about half of the seats are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some Christmas stays at the last moment, " said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The travel agency of Vrchlabí can also offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free seats.
Sold very well The first 14 days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in the winter has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
The People are waiting to see whether there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the runways overlap during the week, Christmas will be complete, " think Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to fill the rooms in the hotel higher than last year.
We are about five percent better.
For Christmas We have the New Year's Eve and Christmas.
There is great interest during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well, " said the director of the best hotel in SGP, Karel Rada.
Eighty per cent of the New Year's Eve visits is also the hotel Omnia near the in the period.
On the contrary, in the latest hotel Janské Lázně at Christmas half the beds is still free.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already sixty percent of the capacity of occupation.
February is a bit weaker at the moment, but as soon as the snow, is the interest in the placements in Giant, the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The hotel of Krkonoše should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be fresher and if there is, they should be the snow in the mountains.
But then again the time should warm, informed Jiří Jakubský of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of wise, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, which he considered himself as simple.
When he finally revealed its Afghan approach, eagerly awaited, it showed that he is a copy of the script used in Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not content to use in the text several times the expression " as in Iraq ", but do not hesitate to use the title of Bush's statement of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: " a new way forward "
At the same time, he has personally criticized the idea of Bush to send new military reinforcements to Iraq, by the civil war as " irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences. "
The following month, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on the recommendations of captains, was the only possible and do not speak today in the news about Iraq.
This has not improved the reputation of Bush, however objectively left to his successor a initial situation much more favourable than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes to repeat the miracle.
In order to increase the contingent have asked the military It again, including the commander of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal, even despite the trench in the White House.
He called for 40,000 men in order to improve the situation.
The president has hesitated for three months, but in the absence of a better option, at least misled the general about 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, has the promise for a further 5,000, even though He himself.
The most problems throughout the strategy Obama seems to be its intention to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finish this process within three years. The doctrine of Obama raises more questions than answers.
Many doubt that the increase in the same fruit that the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, the society of Iraq is relatively well organised, their leaders to respect the agreements.
The Afghan situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to rely on anyone and no agreement is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to change the head every day.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain just a Potemkin smokescreen behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
Balancing the interests of various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the even more complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a " state quick to act ", which is the aim of the operation, does not appear to be very real.
The time horizon of the Obama strategy perplexed by his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has worsened and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a romantic soul, to believe that the small soldiers in the war cry about the " reality can be sent soon return home " will bring a miracle.
From a political point of view, set the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will see this as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, and do not want to explain to their constituents, what the security of Germany or Italy with the war with the Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to respond by example when, according to Obama, America will the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, every solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential election and therefore there is still enough time to working on a new strategy, if it is a total failure.

I suppose that Wall Street is well aware of the overall sense that we must take, mentioned the former investment banker of society's, Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after set aside almost $17 billion in premiums for the first three quarters of this year.

However, the Chamber of Deputies approved on Wednesday the proposals of the left for transfers of money and increased the money for the salaries of officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, that they increase the budget deficit.
Between the left Party, on the one hand, and the government Klaus and right on the other hand, disagreement which calls into question the future of the cabinet of Fischer, who had been trained by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green
Critics claim that the budget, as it was approved by Parliament, the package of austerity measures by the government of Fischer and imposed in the autumn of the public debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget; today declared during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that the politicians of " serious problem " that " disability " of public finances.
According to him today, there are no good solution.
Only a strong government could bring an improvement, which still on a broader consensus among the political parties, according to the president.
The leader of ODS Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is appalling and that the government should consider its future existence.
The Vice - President of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of ČTK the idea of bureaucratic cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.

Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new film by Clint Eastwood
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film " Invictus: the Ungeschlagene " shows the world much of the country, their fight and victories, although some critics say that the roles played by the American players.
The story speaks of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in his life history of the American actor Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91 years, asked him in the film.
Matt Damon plays an important role.
I said to him: " If I must embody, I should be able to see you.
The actor aged years who is awarded a prize for his role in the drama Milion dollar baby of boxing played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which ended slave, a fictional US president, and even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone still alive and, for many people is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was jailed for 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

Freeman worked for several years to bring the history of Mandela on the cinema screens.
He had no other goal than to play this role to bring the these as closely as possible to the reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world political were in the same area, he would have tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela's hand.
I realized that when I shake hands, I recover your energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling of how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh world of rugby.
It was a big surprise For him, when finally met For the first time with Pienaar at home.
I remember when I come to the door of the house, he opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar in my life was: ' in the film much higher ".

The secret of the splendour on Norway resolved: the Russians have tested a missile
Norway was a ray of effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of Defence has recognized that yesterday was tested near the Norwegian border an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch has been a failure and the type " Bulava " which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His presence repeated in the test of the missile has not had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in Most cases, it was not flying or there was damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers speak of " Bulava " as " a missile that did not fly. "
A missile that flies, but do not
This 13th test took place at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight that there was further damage to the apparatus.
This is clearly the engine of the third stage of the rocket that exploded.
This time, " Bulava " was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which plunged sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile launched from a boat that is moving and
That is why It is likely that the mysterious light caused by an unspecified fliegendes object on Northern ways the damaged " Bulava. "
The Norwegians have also since the first moment not doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot talk of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In the previous cases were damaged the engines in the first stage.
Although none of the test launches went smoothly, the direction of the Ministry of Defence only six out of thirteen have been failures.
The success rate of almost 50 per cent full of optimism to the generals and they claim that one day " Bulava " fly without problems and even will take up to ten nuclear, whose total weight of 1.15 tonnes.

Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The direction of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent extra work, the unions have declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesman confirmed the car factory Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
The management, however, wants for this year to agree with the unions on a Saturday.
We cannot abandon our production plan, it is essential, that is why We proposed voluntary overtime on Saturday, 19 December, knowing that there would be two teams, said Vaněk.
The site Sedmička. cz indicated that the company has offered a bonus of 400 CZK employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
The bonus will be paid for the last Saturday, 28 November.
According to The company decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for hours, or they can take a replacement leave on 28 December and extend the Christmas Vanek.
In addition, all employees of the sessions on Saturday will receive compensation for the costs of transport and for their lunch.
Given the fact that the extra work was the most urgent and the warmest in the comments and complaints of trade unionists and last week, the production has the management yesterday afternoon decided to cancel all overtime for the month of December, said.
The staff of the car factory were forced to work Until last week, practically every day two hours in addition to their eight hours.
The unions after signing of the agreement will revoke the emergence of strike.
The following negotiations between the management of the car factory and trade unionists must take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that if they are to meet the demands of some and can sign a joint document that they are prepared to lift the strike.
The situation in the car factory has deteriorated last week, on Wednesday, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of overtime.

Czech discovery: a substance that operates on the HIV virus
The team of Czech and German scientists test new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it is also on the viruses that are resistant to drugs.
In some cases This is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as well as some drugs already available.
The disease AIDS can be cured until now.
However, It can prolong the lives of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their use has a series of side effects.
If the replication of the virus were also has the development of so - called resistant viruses on which the medicines are no longer effective.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the Všcht Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that the substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way of all drugs used today, and so that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
In The work of researchers to discover new substances " improved ", on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanism of the virus.
The metalocarboranes have a single three - dimensional structure: two cages poliedros composed of atoms of boron and hydrogen and carbon are united by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A virus traitor and resilient
The HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus, which is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the proteasis of HIV, there is caused by the fragmentation of the HIV virus and not create mature and infectious particles of the virus.
If we stop the HIV protease, stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, the scientists in a press report published by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations in which two pairs of cages (see table) are united by a short organic link, which is then systematically amended.
A little weaker, but more reliable.
The evidence of The effect of this series of substances on the HIV protease was tested in test tubes and its variants resistant, obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of the Metalokarborane in the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as on the clinically used medicines, but they do not lose their effect on the Resistentvarianten, against which the medicines are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore interesting combinations to consider more towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the laboratory of structural biology of the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics Institute of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute around the budget. The ODS attacked Fischer, he defends
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolánek said that the approved budget for next year is " appalling " and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The statements of ODS, described the prime minister verdict.
It is time for the analysis.
The spokesman of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of cabinet officials with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party seems more.
According to the Prime Minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies wants to rely on the minority, which seeks to combat the growing deficit, or if it is to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach attitude of the ODS and the social Democrats over the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, but with the proposals by the left, by more than 12 billion kronor.
The House has increased the money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has the proposals of Social democracy, that they subtly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, obeying the wishes of the government, that the amended budget is a variant less bad than a budget.
Frustration and futility
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will assess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threaten the resignation in the event of approval of the proposed changes, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota took meeting Monday with the Prime Minister.
He has indicated that he thought to remain in office.
The reason is His disappointment at the Verhandugn of the budget.
If Fischer agree with another fight against the budget deficit, according to the government have nothing to do the Nominanten the ČSSD, which imposed changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make clear that he will resign if the House approves other laws increasing the deficit, for example those health insurance, pensions, or the amendment of the law on services.
Topolánek: ministers nominated by the ODS are not in question.
This is the subject of the Prime Minister Fischer and the government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have not done anything wrong, Topolanek said in a text message from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries in embraced top 09, to who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides the principle of the fight with the amount of the deficit in public finances, " it is completely logical and correct that it is based on the left - wing majority, which is currently in the House. "
That said, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of Democrats.
I have not thought about it, when the time comes, I will deal with this, said of the House to journalists, the Defence Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government by the Democrats.
The Prime Minister Fischer afternoon came to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS came at the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas stressed that the ODS probably would vote in Parliament on Wednesday against the amended budget, if the prime minister does not explicitly request to allow the the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, then he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not the absence of the head of the party in Parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would lack.
As I withdrew To the mandate, I knew that in the following months in particular would be a bolchévisation of the House and the destruction of everything positive, reacted Topolánek.

The ČD will introduce more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník move every two hours.
Travellers can no longer take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
The bill this year for regional railways: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so - called the railways next year in all four billion kronor the same amount as this year. Local trains are ordered by the regions, next year will pay eight billion kronor in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For The railways have newly signed a contract for ten years, until now the was always a year.
The railway the system, which also explains that they have not to the increase in the price of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will affect only tickets a day ČD net and cheap tickets on the Internet eLiška.

In The next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood US cinemas a Invictus (his official title in Czech: Neporažený) , which captures a part of the biography of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.

The second male role of the legendary champion South African rugby has been attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in cinemas, the critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
Its full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 July 1918 in South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for freedom of spirit, in 1993, alongside de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.

Jančura will file a complaint for slander against three prefects of ČSSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will file a complaint for libel against three prefects Social Democrats.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of southern Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura said in Dvacet of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is connected with the effort of the company, maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions have signed long - term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three hetmánes are attacking us and they talk about the fact that we are taking the has only made an offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways, which is not true because we know the price of Czech railways which were set last week.
So we have to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander on society Student Agency, said Jančura Radiožurnál.
At the same time have the evidence that no region has taken in accordance with European law.
That is why We are preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Consider this complaint by the continuation of the show medial of Mr Jančura, serving as free publicity for his company and for himself.
I am of course prepared to defend my good name and the name of my region and I call on others to do the same.
I assume that this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Mr Jančura manipulates the public on the issue of regional rail transport, and used false and untrue arguments, said Hasek.
Jančura has already informed last week that it will invest several million kroner in the advertisement, which will highlight the damaging step of districts.
To Radiožurnál He said that interrupiría the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue after the new year.
He clarified that the campaign will be carried out against the corupción as such.
Jančura began the campaign after the regions were agreed with České dráhy in maintaining regional rail links and for the an order of about 150 billion kronor, without bidding.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to Jančura threats of a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we do not, we will lose the licences of buses.
He was presented as a member of the ČSSD, I do not know who it is, I am not saying his name, said Jančura today to Radiožurnál.
The vaccine will be free and voluntary
The vaccine neumococal from January will put an end to the usual habits.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time voluntary.
The already, saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against neumococos.
The drug Institute is already the highest prices of vaccines, which will pay for health insurance.
The experts also clear in the process of vaccination.
The new vaccination
Free vaccines for children born in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated against pneumococcal free.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
Those who began with the vaccine last year or earlier, you have to cover other doses of the vaccine.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and the fifth month of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families left voluntarily vaccinate their children against.
The parents paid DKK 1600 and more for a dose.
The vaccination of younger requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year the health insurance spend 300 to 450 000 kroons in doses of vaccine.
They save but the treatment, which is needed for children are not vaccinated.
Until now, the state spent by the vaccination of children around 500 000 annually.
The vaccination repaid was introduced with the so - called Janota package.
The neumococo is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
According to surveys in hospitals, until 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, approximately 40 other countries have introduced vaccination repaid.
The vaccine will be mandatory?
At the same time, said that this vaccine duty could be in the future.
From January, it must be covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
The compulsory vaccination would be better, For example, the head of the civic association Nahlas.
His association has long promoted the pneumococcal vaccination.
The experts At an international conference, in which our association participated, were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to achieve at least this.
I believe that this is the path that we must now follow said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the procedure of vaccination against.
At the moment I do not think at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, say doctors.
The Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Society of paediatricians, acknowledges that a voluntary vaccine has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, it could consider a reduction of renewals of vaccinations " in the situation where the vaccine is such a sum I understand the decision making voluntary vaccination, " said Cabrnochová.
The experts expect that from next year, more than 80 percent of young parents will vaccinate their babies.
The Vaccination against Pneumokokken is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children which is funded by the health insurance and not the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money for the prevention, so that they save for further treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors have to buy the vaccine for themselves.
This is a concern of the practical paediatricians, the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, The vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, the same way as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some Members were, however, that the insurance companies, " take the money from the health insurance. "
The doctors will have to buy the products and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to the estimates, pediatricians individually will invest in vaccines 40 000 per month, which is a significant sum.
It will not be easy, said Cabrnochová.

Can the Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters for a ban on building minarets and is widespread concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a detailed report about whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most pronounced säkularisiertesten societies of Europe - and be integrated.
Some readers will this new book as admirers of the latest work the author: " why the French do not like the headscarf " (2006) , an elegant and has divided and concerned the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
The latest book by Mr Bowen has a broader perspective and more ambitious.
As a Good anthropologist, wants to know not only what the politicians and the media about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr Bowen calls " Islamic spaces ".
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should A Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both) ?
The evolution and the rights of homosexuals should be taught to young Muslims?
A Muslim woman can marry a non - Muslim?
Is it permissible for A Muslim can use a banking system based on interests to get a mortgage?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the daily life, rather than the political dramas concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, a Muslim Arab born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate until the end.
The Conservatives are suspicious about the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr Bowen interview tend to disagree with their counterparts from, supporters of Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, is a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that the Muslim values and the French secularism could be compatible.
But a compromise can be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wondered how the French politicians (and the intellectual elite who fiercely defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make their historic compromise with the secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, perceived an adjustment of values ".
Can the Islam be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say " yes, but not yet. "
The trostloseste outlook of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other place on the planet.
The ice is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that can survive elsewhere.
The oil, gas, shipping and fisheries have been approached in the newly open, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors in their wake.
In " on thin ice " (" on thin ice ") Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Aware of the complicated history and politics of the whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who were their evidence in the white bear.
The meeting of the Admiral Nelson as a courageous of 14 years, fighting only with the end of his, is certainly a myth, but others are true.
The young, captured while following the bodies of their mothers just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.

Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally a millionth part of the area of the scope of an adult wild. the climate is rarely mentioned: a polar bear living in Singapore was green with algae that grow in his fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often to the threat posed by hunters on the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and Indians Inuits in powerful assault rifles, to express their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two nations where the ice will last for longer.
In his new book, " after the ice " (the ice " Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and the science of the Arctic and a glimpse of what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmospheric scientists are still Ozeanografen can explain the speed of change.
It is not for lack of effort.

The satellite and the extensive series of probes into the icebergs are a great help, but most work is done by men, camping out in the cold.
Mr Anderson looks within the extraordinary, tiny world of supply system within the Arctic ice, formed by the nets of brackish water by freezing.
But since the bear in the area until the microscopic wonders of the ice, all will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.

Marines among the 6,000 people who have laid wreaths on the graves of Arlington
The Obergefreite De ' Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single wreath at the grave of a soldier who had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina at the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who were in their place.
In a few months, from where we are embarking, these could be us, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we, I would like to see someone do the same for me, so I try to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the event when he and others have decided to decorate several hundreds of graves in the cemetery in Arlington.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen, each year the trip, stopping in various cities along the way, to organize commemorations in honour of military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non - profit organization, Wreaths Across America (placed wreaths Across America) , which has extended the event to other states.
This year more than 16,000 placed wreaths on the graves of the Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville National Cemetery enArkansas, in Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial to the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said that she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a career soldier died.
While her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was a way to thank those who made sacrifices.
This is a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It is like visiting a family tomb.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked through the vast meadows and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers have chosen old graves dating from the First and second world war and the Vietnam War, because they are not as often as the new graves, the organisers.
The mood was optimistic, while the children played and couples were taken by the hand, while wearing the fresh pine to the sepulcrales.
Each table had a dark green, with a small red ribbon tied at the top.
Close, the Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations has given 1,000 kroner to decorate the section but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled the area.
People wept openly, others prayed and families and friends supported each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others were inclined to see small black and white, information in the wetland for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears on the grave of her son.
It is 8 hours of Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of the Marine. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should never forget why we are free ... my son has paid for it, she said.

A US citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor for the U. S. government, sold the cell phones and computers in the country, said the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U. S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U. S. Interest Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested under the pretext of being " dangerous ".
All the so - called counter - revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, the risk of arrest.
The anti - government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bloggers, led by the popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive awards, but the authorities have always been denied.
The arrest of an American citizen may increase tensions between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is a " slow " to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new American policy stresses that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and to create more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity of part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted to ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile Only this year; they are used mainly for text messages, since a 15 - minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
The use of the Internet is extremely limited in the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few U. S. prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berbena, S. Interests representation in Havana.
Berbena said that he could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that, in any other open society would be as mobile free, in Cuba is a crime said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas group Human Rights Watch, which recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called " new Castro, Cuba ", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country, to replace his older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in a day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when the two countries are beginning to have more dialogue.
The Pakistani authorities prevented a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities to the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five men of Northern Virginia to Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that this case could help an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, the Internet in search of young men radicalized.
Investigators said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the Internet video site YouTube.
Arrived in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them to reach the remote area in the tribal belt of Pakistan, which is home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince the commanders of Al Qaeda that the men were not part of a plot by the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist haven
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that the men were not inmutaron and even were trying to get the proper approval for access to the camps of Al Qaeda, when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and who are interviewed by the FBI underlines the critical role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in the determination of the people who trust.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U. S. secret services has made it a priority to try to infiltrate people within Al Qaeda.
The Recruiters of the organization play the role of firewalls, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who might be spies.
According to analysts, the American recruits are studied closely by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive for the group because of their potential access to American targets and their value propagandaire.
But, senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that the terrorist groups also have become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those who admit, because the American intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow the model of recruitment what so many have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen, demanding " action "
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday, demanding the negotiators who work in the Bella conference centre of the city kühneres action on climate change.
The demonstrators said that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On a day in which little happened in the climate talks sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists marched through the city, deploying banners in English saying there is no planet B " and one in Spanish, saying " the Earth said ' enough '.
Several celebrities joined the protest, including the Danish model and Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the country of his mother, Peru, made me aware of the issues with which the country must deal due to the impacts of climate changes that are already happening. "
This is part of the reasons why I decided to join the large demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world to take a fair, ambitious and binding, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way any longer.
The police prevented the demonstrators from approaching the Bella Centre and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the use of masks or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to Danish law, those activities are banned during the demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified because he is involved in the talks on climate, some activists who wore masks and black clothes several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which close to several ministries.
They were in the buildings, he said, adding that they firstly rockets, but then followed by " a few large explosions ".
Inside the Convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march, throughout the afternoon.
But the protest has the awareness of the main officials, such as Su Wei, China's chief negotiator on climate.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration was taking a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, " that is something of which I was not aware of. "
He then continued in Mandarin, saying " as the meeting venue is great, I can hear what is happening outside. "
He noted that the march could be harmful or helpful perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, " you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people.
The data from a test reveal persistent racial differences
The federal report last week on the results in mathematics has brought good news for public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the district is still far behind the schools in the country, the report shows that the Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1 - cm2) are much greater progress in the past two years in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York
But what in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Educational progress) is the persistent gap between African - American and white students, both at local and national level.
The average scores of white students in fourth Grade of D. C. over the past two years, grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) , but their peers African - Americans rose by only three points, 209 to 212.
The achievement gap has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African - Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remained essentially fixed, falling just one point from 245 to 244.
The average score of whites were not included in the results of the test, because the sample size was not large enough.
The overview over a period of six years is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 () , when the first Enpe in the district, was 60 points (262 to 202) .
Although the results achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has been reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District have expressed concern that the rising celebrated by the Director of education institutions Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were powered by white students, who are already good elements.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, director of D. C. Voice, a non - profit group that advocates for equality in education in the District.
I do not move for a span of two or three points, said the Council member of the D. C., Kwame R. Brown (accumulation) , who has a daughter in the fourth class of Eaton primary school) .
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said that the message of the results is that the middle schools (colleges) of the city desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But the concern is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This autumn, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new curriculum of reading, the Wilson reading system, aimed at pupils in the upper classes of the elementary school and middle school, which dominated the fundamentals of reading earlier in their school career and the significantly behind their peers.
The mathematics of every day, a mathematics curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes games and experiences in real life, which was introduced in the district under the former superintendent Clifford Janey, which by the some of the progress reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to offer the best speeches to students who are below the level of degree, said Rhee.
Others say that the results of the NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system and will provide the extra money and resources for schools with less success in order to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, tests of cities.
The conventional political solution is to spend your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Then the objective can Also have political repercussions that this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other schools, it is clinging to the middle class white and black.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the essential element to reduce the difference in performance is the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with charter schools.
We must reach nearly 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of their teachers last year for 185 days, which it considers a " starting point " to increase in the next contract.
Make higher education a promise of future
The bus was arrested in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years, fell and cligne a moment of eyes at the sight of the white columns, brick facades and smaragdgrünen lawn.
The parents of Graciela had only been able to complete high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, when she and the other students in eighth Grade of the group explored Gettysburg, where the tuition costs $38,690 per year, his attitude was less that of a new student impressed that enthusiastic students.
This is where I will study! exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the building of Sciences.
" wow, really? " she said, when the guide spoke of the low ratio of school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that visited the children during their journey of discovery of three days, and now they have fully integrated the message: the question is not whether you go to university.
The question is where.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who have left the high school or are pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands to university education they need to enter the middle class.
In fact, one In five of these " second generation " at the University, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico and Central America, entered the United States without the high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country.
Those who study the higher yield say that often have a natural affinity for the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But the mentoring programmes also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to go to university, especially if its efforts are regular and long - term.
If you look at low - income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time will not, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program, which funded the visit universities of Graciela is a useful example.
Known as gear up, provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems, to implement programmes of preparation, starting when students from low incomes are in middle school and continue until the end of school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent of the university, according to the U. S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi oil ministry of agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auction that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of oil with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in the restoration of the oil industry, of Iraq, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are left with an interest in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only presented an offer lost.
Two American companies have won contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The weak representation of the American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, are Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the forum Iraq Oil Forum, a site of information on the Internet.
It will be a long time before another offer in Iraq.
Concerns about security, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and The political instability while the U. S. military withdraws, probably prevented the American oil companies risk more strongly in Iraq, which has the third largest crude oil reserves in the world, said analysts.
American companies were, in some cases at a disadvantage, because of their rivals, especially the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by the government, have significantly lower labor costs and are more prone to take risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon - Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the ministry.
The main American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years, are empty - handed.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the state, in more contracts than any other companies and achieved major investments in contracts for two major fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman of the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on an equal footing with its competitors and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
For The companies to submit proposals made offers which were then compared with the subsidy per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of Al Qaeda was killed in Pakistan
It seems that a US missile, which hit along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of the operations this week, said on Friday, representatives of the counter - intelligence.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leader this autumn.
Saleh was one of the two Arab men suspected to have been killed by a pair of missiles in their car, Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to U. S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities said that the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA in the lawless tribal area of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, in the direction of the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of the secret services Pakistani civilian intelligence agency of Pakistan, speaking by telephone from Miran Shah.
The official said that local militants suspected rushed to the site and quickly seized what was left of the " completely destroyed ".
The local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two representatives of the counter - terrorism cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a military planner of Al Qaeda, who led the operations of the terrorist group outside the region of Afghanistan - Pakistan.
He was involved in plots around the world, said a senior official, who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the American air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from the Topführern of Al Qaeda and translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second US official said that Somali had risen rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a household name for some Americans, but this does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of Al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other operators.
The pace of attacks carried out by the CIA drones has declined since the summer, about six operations per month to two, according to a count by the Long War Journal, a Web site run by a non - profit group.
The decline is perhaps due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while ruthlessly to informants, said the site.
The UN special envoy in Kabul withdrew
The UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the presidential election supported by the UN.
The departure of Eide happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional U. S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supports the increase, but is concerned that the US timetable for military withdrawal that begins in 18 months to other NATO governments to withdraw its forces.
We need to accelerate the development of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can rely on the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international staff assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase in the military must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said that he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, only two years in Kabul.
He said that he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
Secretary - General Ban Ki - moon, so now knows that he had time to find a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better to start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun to search for a replacement, According to UN officials.
The representatives say that the name of Staffan di Mistura was quoted; it is a citizen who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean - Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who has previously led the peacekeeping missions.
Eide position in Afghanistan has been put to The test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential elections and to hide evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the charges, but said that the allegations of Galbraith, who was fired the - " have damaged the mission, because there was already a good dose of scepticism regarding the international interference " in the election.
Eide said that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of American forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the leadership of the UN to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that it is attributed to the Afghan mission, saying that this would their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy hiring regulations of the UN hindered its ability to bring new talent.
The rules of the UN are such that I could not recruit only one person since May, he said.
It is catastrophic and it cannot continue.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers would soon impose " significant additional sanctions " on Iran because of its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 American troops in northern Iraq, during a trip to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that I regret is that, if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has said that some sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the street.
He said that a " package of incentives and " be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would they would be less safe with nuclear weapons ", because " his people will suffer greatly " sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders in warning that Iran will face consequences " credible " if its nuclear programme in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, he indicated that he would resume the talks on the reduction of its nuclear programme, and a substantial part of its enriched uranium in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build confidence between the two parties and to win time for negotiations.
But Since then, Iran appears to be distant attempts - in part, say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided on the possibility of engaging with the United States.
Frankly, I think the international community in relation to some of the proposals, which they had agreed in early October, has joined the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before he other options, including the continuation of what the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called " devastating sanctions. "
In a statement Thursday in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations has denounced what it called " baseless allegations " of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and said to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, " in order to achieve an appropriate solution in the long term. "
Gates, who was to return to Washington late last Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the oil rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with troops in Kirkuk and the Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, in particular with regard to the borders, property rights and the sharing of revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to avoid any delay in the U. S. plans to reduce the number of American troops 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to ease the Kurdish anxiety about the imminent withdrawal of troops. the American authorities have quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government: " We will your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
In China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters of preaching the Mother Earth is too tired to sustain more children " and " a baby means one more tomb. "
Learned the lesson so well that, when government officials in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and the ageing population of their city, have radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their response was instant and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
There is nothing for a second, said Wang, 31, a director of human resources with a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one - child policy in China, creating two generations of children notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed " little emperors ", a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared to the six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 years and over, 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is well above the global average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in the rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 percent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission population and has said that fertile couples must have babies to help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and to prevent a shortage of labor in the future ".
Shanghai is about to be " as old - but not so rich, however - that the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden, " she said.
A gradual relief
Enshrined in the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one - child policy is perhaps the most controversial requirement introduced by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and job discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoid a critical pressure on the country's natural resources, while human rights activists have denounced abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced women pregnant with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions, leading to a ratio of women.
In recent years, the authorities of the population have gradually softened their position on the one - child policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are children, and in 2007, many of their hard - line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that the central government recently even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
In no time, the posters encouraging families to have only one child, have been replaced by copies of regulations detailing who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent to family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their home and slipping leaflets under doors.
He has also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
The head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban districts reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five requests per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010 only slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the municipality Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give the best to their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would love to have two children and are legally permitted.
But like many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West assess the one child policy ' as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
Yes, we are stealing the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
Is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, the manager of human resources, said that he wants a single child because she was: " We were the centre of the family and We were accustomed to all of us.
We are not accustomed to care for others and we do not really want to take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a translation company said more bluntly.
For parents with two careers, middle class, reducing the birth rate, he said, is to be successful and we must be selfish.
The people of 20 or 30 years grew up watching their parents struggle in during the early days of the Chinese capitalism and do not want to have this kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time of his parents, he said.
A mother must abandon at least two years of their social life.
Then there are the problems of space, " You must change your apartment " - and the " if the child is 9 months old, we have a CV for the best nursery. "
Most of his friends are ready to face this once, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
A group of the UN outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The climate conference sponsored by the UN, characterised so far by offensive positions and mutual recriminations, a renewed focus on Friday with the publication of a document that provides for ambitious cuts in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations supporting most of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Prepared by a special working group of the UN, the text does not talk about how much money would give the rich to poor countries to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for the key issues, including how the developed economies and major emerging economies could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives a great deal of flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, senior representatives of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has written six pages of the document, summed up a negotiating text of 180 pages to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as " the big picture. "
It shows the outline of a possible agreement, in which the industrial nations collectively reduce their emissions by 2020 to 25 to 45 percent, compared with 1990 levels, while major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years, to help the poorer countries to adapt to the impact of climate change - from floods and droughts to deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercation occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
The U. S. climate envoy Todd Stern has rejected the mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, in compared with the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed countries.
This change is The signal that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China, with regard to what the Bush administration two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text does not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, has said that the US chief negotiator, lacked " common sense " or was " highly irresponsible " for having said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China to combat global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the world's major powers are at stake, the fault lines both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more to the rescue of individual economies that to save the planet, with China and the United States on their respective obligations, while poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries of the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are arguing about who should bear the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters accountable for their actions.
It is clear that This is a game in which is developing a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who is also adviser on climate for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change, said that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the key participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, has drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge - Metzger, head of the international climate unit of the European Commission, said that the thrust of the small island states has " political pressure on the political process, " in part because they are now unified and require the emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency, as the delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the issues before the heads of government come to an agreement.
High - level officials, such as the Indian environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, fell from their aircraft and rushed into the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, in order to " during the next week.
The real image of the assembly - in which 13,000 people come in and out of the convention centre, activists hold late - night comedy shows, where they make fun mockery of the countries who betrayed and that proposals are and distributed on paper rather than by a challenge.
The intensity is increasing: almost all key ministers are now here and on Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice - president for global policy of Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
In Britain, the first train to 225 km/h will redefine the Monday
5h13, Monday morning, a whistle the darkness to point start of a train that will mark a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first high - speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h, of Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first commuter train Javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service linking Britain to an international network of fast trains and reliable and the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, the business travel will be much less long and the passage of the plane and car to rail would reduce the congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage, the high - speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2) , a company based in January to provide the government will present a feasibility study, Lord Adonis, According to the Times report on 30 December.
This will provide a detailed road map of the next stage planned for the high - speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a radius of five metres in urban areas and in places where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be fleshed out within a radius of 25 metres from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 presents three options for a high - speed network to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option is being proposed is a configuration with and in which a high - speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line would split in or near Birmingham, with a branch to the west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in the northeast, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would come to Scotland.
" It seems that this will be the most beneficial option, " said a member of the railways.
Once completed, the journey times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part, which will not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with more than an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel to 400km/h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains to long and capable of carrying 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a line in London - Birmingham.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the constraints of space, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to accommodate the high - speed network.
The rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he believes that the project should be put in place, but broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network would have to be built in sections.
The trains had to switch from the high - speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, maintaining journey times between London and Scotland over the three hours.
This is seen as a crucial point needed to ensure a change of planes to trains, a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay the loan of £75,000 for the Orangerie of Tory
Alan Duncan, the Conservative member of parliament, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the cost of a Orangerie he has built in his house in his in his constituency.
The prison of the party, which was downgraded by David Cameron for complaining that members were " maintained ", has increased its loan of £75,000 to build an extension in oak at his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to pay the extra interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The House of Commons authorities received complaints at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is leading a review of the expenditure of members. Last night, Mr Duncan said that complaints could not be " clearer or more simple ".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of the house of parliament, has a two - storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fees office said that Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a porch at home, described in the plans as a ".
Neighbours described it as a " greenhouse for entertainment. "
He was not asked Mr Duncan to give during a recent investigation of an explanation for the increase in borrowing by the Committee on standards and privileges of the House of Commons on its loans.
The Committee has acquitted him last month of violating the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan has changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of 271.406 pounds of their property in London at the home of his constituency, which he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan until March last year, about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as mortgage interest rates.
In April, its applications have increased to more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on the loan RBS of Mr Duncan has not been changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the loan of £75,000.
The standard variable mortgage interest rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, the rate that is now.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr Duncan continued to ask in May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as chairman of the opposition of the House in September, after a reporter supposedly filmed saying that members of parliament had to survive " on rations " after the expenses scandal.
" In fact, it is now national, you have to live on budget " and you are treated as "
He said: " I have spent my money in my garden and I ask a tiny part, based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for much more, but I do not. "
The Member, a millionaire from his former career as an oil trader, was questioned in the first place on their spending in May, when it emerged that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before agreeing with the fees office that could be considered excessive ".
An activist has dug a hole in the form of the symbol of the pound sterling in the lawn of Mr Duncan in protest, after it was revealed that he had requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase of the mortgage, Mr Duncan said: " It was for improvements, adopted both by the office of salaries and subsequently by Legg. "
He added: " There is no problem of evasion or development or use of rules or whatever.
This is completely within the limits, in the rules, authorised, etc.
This could not be clearer or more simple. "

Brighton is a creative and vibrant and we try to experiment and to represent it through spirituality. "
Late payments: angry prison guards, actions
The unions for prison guards called on Friday to a " general mobilization " to demand the payment by the end of year bonuses and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.

I asked the leadership of the prison administration to immediately implement a set of measures to ensure that this situation caused by a poor assessment of the number of overtime not repeated in the future, " added Mrs Alliot - Marie.
The pay of December will be lean, except for the staff of the direction that has the benefit of functions and objectives, deplored the Ufap/Unsa, for which the " budgetary constraints have good ".
It is a real scandal, said outraged the interregional trade union FO in Marseille, announcing his decision to boycott until further notice " all meetings and ".
The staff will not to work on Sundays and holidays if the hours of October are not paid in December, the same for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône - Alpes - auvergne.

According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are less affected than others.
But in any case, the result is not, said the Secretary - General of the Ufap, Jean - François Forget.

The French Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski's called again Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States) , the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of " the Pianist ", denounced before three judges of the Court of Appeal of the second district of California serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
I called for the abandonment charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, " chilling ".
According to him, the judge Rittenband -- died since would have talked with a prosecutor that would have commented that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before which is a serious lack of procedure.
This debate was revealed in the documentary " Roman Polanski: Wanted and desired " (Roman Polanski, sought and desired) , the mouth of the prosecutor, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September " lied " to the author of the documentary.
Hummel called for the conclusion of a trial that would allow it to present the evidence of his argument If the court rejected the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument in the first instance, namely that no charges could not be seriously considered as Roman Polanski would not present in court.
The filmmaker, 76 years of age, fled the United States in 1978, before the sentencing, for " illegal sexual relations " with a child of 13 years.
Since then, never returned to the United States.
The deputy attorney general of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, declared that Roman Polanski " must be there to appear at the hearing. "
In this case, we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is the possibility of escape? , asked Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker " calls a favour to the court, although his authority ".
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to give their decision - also stressed " that there were other alternatives to the flight ".
Hummel was not the only one to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also called, once again, the end of the case.
She recalled that his client no longer bear to be harassed every rebound of the Polanski case, and added: " Nobody in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty - two years is enough ".
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on U. S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to under house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, pending a possible extradition.

The news of Johnny Hallyday " are very positive, " said his son David on Friday at his arrival at the airport in Los Angeles where he had to accompany his father, hospitalized for several days.
The news are very positive.
It is very strong, it is going very well, said the press David Hallyday to her the plane to Paris shortly after the 13 local (21 h GMT) .
The son of the singer, relaxed, said that he would move " very quickly " to the hospital Cedars - sinaï of Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was " placed in an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles for reasons of convenience, to prevent suffering and to be able to administer his treatment, " said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the hospital Cedars - sinaï in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a hernia operation on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was operated on in the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of severe injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning at the Lycée Français de Los Angeles, where their daughter Jade, to attend a school, a photographer of the AFP.
The head of orthopaedic surgery and trauma of the Pitié - Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel on Monday in Los Angeles with the singer.
The producer has the Neurochirurgen Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November at the international clinic Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were outraged, said Mr Camus.
I have heard talk of a possible demand, he said.
Jean - Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday had " much too quickly to Los Angeles, with the permission of the surgeon. "
I had this doctor in person in line who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and I was amazed, because I operated on twice, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently " party without drain, without anything, " after his operation.
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly - sur - Seine where he was at the time.
In 2007, he had also made the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to eliminate a hematoma following a brain haemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor with a bad reputation, condemned by justice on several occasions by malapraxis, and for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, counsel for the order of doctors, was accused of being " a man without scruples " defendant " regularly " before the Council of the order, and is " far from desirable. "
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention was " perfectly well " and that the results of the studies were " normal ".
The operation, " could not provocarhemorragias and did not need drainage, " he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered into a parenthesis.
Clearly, a resumption of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens, Ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr Camus.
The association UDF increase the tone and warns the new centre on the use of its acronym
The association UDF, controlled by the Modem François Bayrou, responded Friday to the attempt takeover of the President of the new centre, Hervé Morin of the party Nouveau to use on any support, on pain of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced its intention to recover the acronym UDF, believing that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political legacy after reaching out to the left.
The Defence Minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of the Member Hervé de Charette (former UMP NC) who claims ownership of the brand UDF for being the first to file in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday night, the office of the association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of this, broke the silence to launch a formal notice to the Minister and the member intimándolos to renounce the acronym and to transfer the property rights of the brand, under penalty of prosecution.
In recent days, You have made many statements suggesting that you would propose to your political movement of + + the acronym UDF, wrote the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez the modem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
Also believe right to continue with the use of the name of the movement, the + Nouveau focus +, and the slogan of the UDF +, also the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to the use of the acronym, explains the office of the UDF that remains the NC to withdraw " immediately the mention of the name of the UDF all support, as well as of (his) website ".
It also calls Hervé de Charette " to transfer the property of (the) marks the legitimate ".
If you refuse, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, warning the signatories.
In their letter, they specify that the UDF " is a real political movement since 1978 " and remember that Morin and his friends " chose " to leave in 2007 " to create a competitor, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP ".
The new centre has therefore, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy) .
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 accession to the modem for three years and the creation of an office to defend " the material and moral interests " of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Mr Hervé de Charette, continuing the office, " when he filed the mark ", it was " no longer a member of the UDF for three years, " but the UMP.
He benefited on scandalous and fraudulent the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to do.
This indiscretion is becoming crime, before a mockery of denounced the strategy of the NC: " It seems that in politics, as in life, it is more to make a name for themselves to try to get out of anonymity fraudulently a name that is not right ".
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François - Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist François - Marie Banier to determine if, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, took advantage of a state of weakness of the part of his fortune.

But the 15th criminal chamber also ordered that a medical examination of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87 years old, should be carried out by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such examinations, even more in the conditions proposed by the public prosecutor's office of Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors designated this Friday will submit a report before 10 March 2010, in which particular if Liliane Bettencourt could find themselves in a state of weakness and what periods.
I think that it will accept.
I will speak with her, said the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt Georges Kiejman, out of the hearing.
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt - Meyers, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...) The report will show that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady that we must protect, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt initiated criminal proceedings against François - Marie Banier, photographer and artist, has been used for years of the weakness of his mother to one billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, which she sees as a long - standing friend.
On Friday, While the court should examine the admissibility of the action brought by Ms Bettencourt - Meyers, the allegations of lawyers were, in some cases, a large family confession.
In this way, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt took into account three letters that his client (1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which he said that the husband of Françoise Bettencourt - Meyers.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: " could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years.
Françoise, I have never been able to speak to him since his marriage ".
For its part, the prosecutor in Nanterre, once again, that the complainant was not in a position to appear, especially as a judge refused in recent days, to grant his request to open a judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt " has full capacity to act, it is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place, " said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie - chrsitine Daubigney.
The court has Finally decided that once the trial on the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt - Meyers.
Managerial revolution or end of the intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the major French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence have been in vain ...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, recalls the position of the company vis à vis consumers before the marketing: it is to join the staff to " values " determined from above as it was made at the consumer products designed by the technicians of the plant.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution gave the strategies of conquest of the markets place ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products separately factors preferences of customers regularly again!
A demobilisation of employees can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that affects in particular the executives.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including R& D and, even more importantly, the economic intelligence.
Indeed, the business intelligence) " demands that all the parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward - looking vision "; it needs by employees a commitment that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian direction.
That is why we are calling for a managerial revolution, which would put the staff at the centre of the concerns of the company as the customer.
The usefulness of internal polls
The internal opinion polls, as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salariés - will encourage the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I fear not.
- in principle, because I could see that, faced with a new situation, and after many detours, to do ... what it has always done.
- Secondly, because the authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of the power in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From the large schools of engineers, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old theory, reactivated recently by the " neuroscience " American and widely disseminated, institutes and the media behind their backs.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to handle the " levers " (sic) of the commitment of executives, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro. fr reaffirms the managers in a position of management, unsuited to today's world.
Identify and measure the factors of mobilisation
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, is taking a vision of human behavior.
It is to integrate, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental fact: for employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it is clearly as a means to a portion of their dreams, their ambitions and their projects.
Currently, only the studies from the analysis motifonctionnelle adopt this concept of the motivations of employees.
These studies have shown that they believe their companies based on a predetermined which allows them, through their image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life projects.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of these factors of mobilization, business leaders can monitor, predict and anticipate their " social performance " and invest its human resource management " in the place. "
They create a fertile ground for the harmonious development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: the " just war " Obama receives praise from the right
On Friday, The American right, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of " just war " against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had discredited the prize to Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, the former candidate for the vice - president in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, declared Mrs Palin, égérie of the right wing of the Republican Party to the newspaper USA Today, and added that she had addressed the subject of the war " sometimes necessary " in his memoirs that have been published.
The war is, of course, the last thing in my opinion that the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, has worked on Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, found that the president had done " a very good job " in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very well, welcomed the former president of the House of Representatives, particularly the reference to " the existence of evil in the world " in the presidential.
At times, the speech I found this very historic, " said Mr. Gingrich, in the radio show " The Takeaway ".
The former elected, which some see as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said he was pleased to have seen a " president of the left " when the members of the Nobel Committee " that they would not be free and could not provide a prize for peace if the use of force did not exist ".
For Michael Gerson, a former scribe of George W. Bush and now editor in the Washington Post, Obama has " a very American speech ".
In addition to stand as " citizen of the world " as it always does, " " spoke as an American president, " to remind the Europeans " living in a bubble of security that they have not created and that they do little to preserve it, " said Gerson.
Among the few right not very convinced, a hawk in the Bush era, the former ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, called the speech " dull, pretentious and inspiration " on the National Review Online.
To the left of the president, the Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
However, The press centre - left praised the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Obama, described the speech " overproduction " even for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo " should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression, " the California newspaper.
Obama " made the New York Times speech that was necessary, " said the at the same time of bleak and uplifting. "
Drivers: three marathon for an agreement that the supply of Christmas
After three sessions of negotiations marathon, the trade unions and employers ' organisation TLF, only to be stayed until the end, arrived Friday night to an agreement that puts an end to the strike and the threat that falls on the supply of Christmas.
At the meeting of signatures on Friday evening, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was " pleased " with the agreement, after several sessions of negotiations, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators were left in the morning Friday, with the hope of quickly sign the text of the agreement at the end of the morning.
Even if three employers ' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11.00 so that everyone is in agreement and that the text is signed.
The conflict " would have been very damaging for business " and " it was feared that disrupt the festivities end of the year, " said Mr Bussereau.
The text provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in the local and regional road transport) , and 2.9% for the highest (international transport) .
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages rising from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It is not much, but it is very far, explained Patrice Clos (FO) .
If so, we are going to give the order to our militants that there are no more cuts or blockages in the centres of supply.
But can always be some who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that it is " a good agreement ", although it was " difficult to grant high wage increases in the face of international competition ".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and respect of employees, " said Maxime Dumont (CFDT) , while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed " a historic agreement ".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) is " an acceptable compromise. "
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of the travel expenses of 3% and the holding of general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will address the issue of a 13th month and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that " a low of EUR 100 million euros in employers ' was the subject of an amendment to the bill of the government the corrected finances for 2009, voted in the night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote " under the same terms.
The signing of the TLF allows that the agreement, for the first of this organisation affiliated companies, and, secondly, to the entire profession, in the event an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be " as soon as possible, " assured Mr Bussereau.
The opposition of employers ' organisations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a " fool ", because the 100 million euros " had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax. "
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to those who want to the next, deplored the Unostra.
For the Otre, the agreement puts at risk " the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months. "
RER A: conflicts over the weekend, unions unhappy with the proposals of the RATP
The disruption on the line RER A, the largest urban public transport in France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting Friday, 2nd day of strike between unions and management of the RATP, there was no agreement and the demand for premium.

The RER A crosses from west to east the Paris.
The RATP short of Saint - Germain - en - Laye and Nanterre and Boissy - Saint - Léger and Marne - la - Vallée.
On Friday, roughly one in two trains circulated at peak hours, and almost no train in hours, as planned.
On Thursday, there was no crowds on the docks, the Franciliens organized.
And in the morning, the station of Saint - Germain - en - Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy - Saint - Léger (Val - de - Marne) , Jack Nbakina, engineer of 29 years, explained to be lifted " an hour and a half to get to work on time. "
The station Saint - Lazare has not, indicated the SNCF, which had planned the supervision of police and security forces.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy - le - haut arrived or departed from the station Saint - Lazare to join the subways.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, " unsatisfactory " according to the unions, a meeting with the management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER an on all aspects, of working time, professional development, etc.
This is not what they want drivers who are demanding a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South) .
The RATP puts even its proposals premium brackets, has outraged the CGT, stressing that the leadership " was not able to resolve a problem while in the road and the SNCF is done. "
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for " a broader review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession, " said the RATP.
What also led to the unions that the company " scoffed users of the weekend. "

The Turkish justice dissolved the pro - Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled Friday the dissolution of the main pro - Kurdish party in the country, a decision that immediately provoked anger in the Kurdish community, in the south - east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a " hotbed of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity, " declared to the press, the president of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, with a majority of seven votes needed to get the dissolution, indicated Kiliç, and added that 37 of the leaders of the party, including its President Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for five years.
Furthermore, The judge announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity which enjoyed Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the assets of the party by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550) .
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that Members of Parliament before being parliamentarians without partisan label.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, which accused the DTP to the " principles " of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) , considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party, " no connection " to have the PKK, but refuses to describe it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the court comes as the government is to reach out to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, for which the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP claimed that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in the southeast, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeast populated mostly by Kurds.
The police fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails and stones with slingshots.
Hundreds of people marched in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of Justice would " deepen the despair ".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish, banning a party, " he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, " said the Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a frustrating the democratic opening launched by the government, commented on the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, " he added.
On Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered as a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenogrado, one of the 10 districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union, a place of secret weapons, under strict supervision.
Today, the community with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is regarded as the " Silicon Valley ".
Here are important centres of research and production of micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogrado have contacted the seat of scientific Riedberg in Frankfurt, with the university institutes and companies in the centre of innovation in Frankfurt (FIZ) .
There were signed several mutual visits and now, on Wednesday, and Riedberg in Frankfurt a " protocol of close collaboration ".
The signatories were the Deputy mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the Selengrado, Anatoly Smirnov, led the Russian delegation, Frankfurt the head of planning services.
In 2010 will be representatives of the FIZ and small and medium - sized enterprises In the scientific research, for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Firms of the FIZ will be on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, want to Russian science firms contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of electronic technology, the big corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaja - Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so - called " socialist planned city " for research.
Selenogrado (literally translated as " green City ") received its name from the forested hills landscape, in which the are embedded.
Stuttgart
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 can start not high enough.
For the proponents of the project is purely and simply " the new heart of Europe ".
The law so. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which the City of the capital of Baden - württemberga a decade of chaos of construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 1980s.
With terminals, which end up in the middle of the city, were at that time as the relics of the 19th century, acting as brakes of a modern rail traffic, since it was formerly took a lot of time to get the back to the front.
In short, drive - to go further.
And That is why the head stations disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a station of trains, which is about halfway on the trans - European rail between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava where the slogan of " heart of Europe ".
The project S21 will really start, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners have recognized that the cost to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
Head stations have no entry and exit problem any more, however, since there are modern reversible with cars at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 and the new route after Ulm is now being addressed.
Regional and local politicians have.
The train continues, because the risks of the great individual infrastructure projects of the Einzelprojekts the Republic of taxpayers and not the state company.
From the point of view, the project is relatively well justified.
It creates new urban area, which, according to the computergenerierten graphs of the planners generated by computer - will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The station and the road are designed for the transport of persons, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time was not yet the competition from low - cost flights.
But The modern transport policy must first deal to strengthen the transport of goods, as the transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly than by lorries on the roads.
But the new route, with its inclinations, unsuitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be in the Schwäbischen are buried.
This is the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to 15 billion is more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade will lack the money for other crossings and congestion in the network.
The list of the Ministry of transport in 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section through the Rhine Valley of 180 kilometres.
Since 1987, is being built on the route in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to support here on the fungus.
But the project S21 will act as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight traffic, and this in the heart of Europe.
The government is considering the judgment on the airport
The regional parliament in Wiesbaden, the Land government has raised the possibility of appeal to the judgment of the Administrative Court of Hesse on the ban on night flights in revision.
The coalition of CDU/FDP appears to have asked experts to the more than 400 pages legal research of the judgment of the Vgh Dieter Posch (FDP) .
The administrative Court in Kassel had established on these days in writing that the country in the case of the planned construction of the north west runway at Frankfurt airport, the should regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p. m., as envisaged in the country's government, was not compatible with the legal protection of the population against air pollution at night.
The coalition has to decide until 4 January, if it wishes to make an appeal against the judgment.
The opposition criticized this time and attempts to put pressure on the representatives of the government to the appeal to the Administrative Court of the nation in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group Torsten Schäfer - Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promises made before the elections and which was to ban night flights, Otherwise this could be it as a lack of floor.
It is difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP election slogan " We hold word ".
The Minister Dieter Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer - Gümbel who claims that the country's government would be trying to even the night flights using " avocasserie and roublardises ".
A comprehensive legal research would need some time.
The coalition did not on the basis of a " rapid first impression.
We need a decision legally, said Stefan Müller (FDP) .
So, As The opposition, been the statements of his group's ban on night flights.
US banks repay aid
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, their state shackles.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion euros) in one fell swoop.
And also the group Citi plans to repay state aid, according to a report by the United States.
The banking institutions seek to get rid of restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of the money, such as the restriction on the payment of the bonus as well as the payment of high rates.

On Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis the Director General of the Bank to the American taxpayers: the injection was helped to overcome a very difficult time.
The banking house had miscalculated the effort of the takeover of the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial crisis.
The Citigroup also plans to get money in the capital market in order to free themselves from the guardianship of the state.
The U. S. bank could launch as early as Thursday a capital increase of $20 billion dollars, reported the CNBC under circles.

Election
In the end it was faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current holding the post of editor - in - chief of Nikolaus Brender by the board of the German ZDF, the successor is appointed.
Yesterday evening The committee wanted to vote on the candidate.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF in Berlin.
There was no confirmation from the station, however - officially, in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to further damage to the the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be accepted by the board of directors.
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the Committee.
The outcome of the vote was not yet known at the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the administrative Council with his proposal to extend for five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. The dismissal of Brender was a significant defeat for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the Union majority on the board had already signaled weeks before the election, not to want to Brender in his post.
Had organised the resistance against the editor - in - chief of the hessische prime minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender would have lost the news of the ZDF in ratings, has refused to accept another term of office of the hearing.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests because of this, in which the political influence on the ZDF.
At the end there was even 35 experts in public law in the debate, the chefs as unconstitutional agreeable.
But it will be for nothing.
The person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, education and Romance.
He then worked in the Südwestfunk (Rhineland - Palatinate) and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first of the news magazine " heute - journal. "
Then his journey continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor of the time; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director of " morning magazine "; until 2001, of the foreign policy; since then, head of the study in the capital.
After the disgrace of Brender, which had just been elected journalist of the year by the journal medium Magazin, the Greens have a constitutional complaint
The opponent of Koch in the administrative Council, the President of Rhineland - Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should change the state convention of the ZDF so that the proposals of the director cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of political supporters of the control bodies of the ZDF, However.
Peter Frey, the likely successor to Brender had recommended to the board of directors with a bold move - when he criticised the body immediately after the dismissal of Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose for the post of editor without losing face, as well as the board could elect without being a partisan office.
In the representations of the parties, Frey is left - wing liberals.
The study will entrümpelt
Partial success for students: After a year of educational strike the Ministers of education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and delegates to the conference of rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve conditions of study in the cases of bachelor and masters.
In the future, students should be able to overcome their studies.
For example, agreed to reduce the burden of reviews: a single review should close the module of study.
In addition, the workload will be reconsidée to ensure " a realistic and acceptable ".
The policy and universities want to simplify further the recognition of results of examinations between the universities inside and outside Germany.
The Länder are committed to organise common structural requirements more flexible for the bachelor and masters.
At the regional level, there should not be beyond.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the ministers of Education and culture and the presidents of universities have repeatedly in the mouth the buzzword: " étudiabilité ".
Now for the first time there was talk of a specific content.
The so - called accreditation council decided to reduce the number of reviews: " Each module should normally be concluded by a single examination, " says in a 30 - page document, which aims to regulate the approval of the university.
With the " significantly reduce Reinhold Grimm, president of the accreditation Council said that the burden of reviews should be able to stop the slippage, which would significantly the étudiabilité.
The " étudiabilité " should be, in the future, the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and content must be examined thoroughly to see if we unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of.
The courses.
The Students should " have the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage the own initiative ".
Apply The rules for the authorisation of new, but also in the examination of existing careers.
These must be " reacreditar " every five years, which means that it will take until 2015, and reviewed all studies.
Responsible's ten accreditation agencies, which are the accreditation, created by the countries of accreditation Council.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies, so that the programmes are not too loaded and the regime of not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and colleges specialized have already agreed with the ministries to take such measures.
Rhineland - Palatinate is so far the only provide additional resources for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize programs tutorielset strengthen the offices of educational as well as the offices of examinations and from outside.
The Länder and universities provide a budget of 10 million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring to Parliament an amendment to the law on higher education institutions.
This is supposed to be for the conclusion of a studies model only one test.
The studies should be more flexible, the recognition of certificates to other universities and access to the master easier.
By the end of next year should be reviewed all studies of the country on their Studierbarkeit.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition discussed again on the conditions of study in the country.
Part of The praise there was also criticism of the decisions.
The federal Bureau of the Juso university groups, the design of the education policy should no longer " behind closed doors, " the Minister and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, students as people should be able to speak a little.
The President of the board of university rectors (HRK) , The support of the of the delegates to the Conference Margret Wintermantel: " We need the experience of the students, " she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which the HRK on a common reform paper.
For the Union of education and science (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It calls for a legal right to each graduates with a bachelor close access to a secondary Masters course.
Andreas Keller member of the steering committee of the GEW request that the current generation of students bachelor degree today, tomorrow there will be enough places for the best possible conditions studies as a
The countries have to be much more teachers.
But on greater access to the master, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
In Germany and is nice almost no control ... " is the first line of a poem by Werner Söllner in fragments of language, in which tematiza experiences of arrival in Germany a dissident, who won the freedom, but has lost both his language area.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and later as director of collection in a children's book publishing, before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner is with various literary prizes, in 1993 kept the legendary Frankfurter Poetikvorlesungen the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has director of the forum of literature in Hesse in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Given that speak quite last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, the " German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files. "
Visibly unsafe and ashamed, Söllner read out a statement in which he admitted to his fellow writers such as Richard Wagner William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer for the Securitate.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the prize of the German language.
The trials began in 1971.
I am, Söllner, " someone who has not sufficiently stood auxessais attempts to provocation of fear of the Securitate. "
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the honoration Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his literary copies with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, and the evil of a political system in a case that makes based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, so far after bisherigem knowledge can say, not only the perpetrators, but also a victim.
In his Securitate file Im Walter had played a role, said the specialist literature Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and it refers to the positive influence of the Walter for him.
He had It in for him at the time sensitive points " herausgehauen, according to Markel.
" I feel the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, the confession of a former dissidents and its cooperation with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany was a cosy reserve for spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the weekly " Die Zeit, having read his own record of 914 pages.
Those involved have surely speculation and will know in some cases, what names were hidden behind Sorin, Voicu and the pseudonyms of Walter.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the dealing with the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification was boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS) was created in 1999, corresponding to the launch of the acts since then, however, is more slowly.
Since 2005, there is a law that regulates the administration of the acts.
The influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Müller, very high, is confirmed by an interview with a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar after the announcement of the award of about the Prize winner.
" She had a psychosis, and in the end only once.
The infamy of power, said quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the case Söllner, as so often when there is blame.
Why only now? who was harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners off the confession of Söllner leaves hope that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by the desire for knowledge and not so much of blame and shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
The Champions League
When the new coach of the football team VfB Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by a plastic bag of orange colour of the supplier of his team, took a taxi Mercedes Class C a quarter of an hour after midnight, gave the impression that a member of the a very nice Christmas celebration, in which the hand.
The man in the feature had hired a driver, because we still do not know the city.
Otherwise he would be able to drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and he was not drunk happiness.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow would start work again.
Or would start for the first time.
In The words of only three days earlier: " we have achieved the eighth final namely in the Champions League of ", that thanks to but we must not be blinded by the success: 1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania, to will be a brutal fight against the drop. "
The " much more important task " on Sunday.
Then, it is to repeat in Mainz the results of the Champions League.
And to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three quick goals of Marica (5) , Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11) .

The eighth final of the Champions League (game go 16. + 23/24 February/return match. + 16/17 March) on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of winning the commencement of the Babbel successor was up.
Not only with the supposed saviours, of the unsettled Stuttgart professionals in the short time self - confidence, had given goodwill and game.
I went with the players and I told them that they should focus on their strengths, I advised to be more courageous, explained the souls plumber Gross - the recipe for success that sounds, but had ceased to have any effect.
He has triggered a certain magic, Jens Lehmann - supporter of Babbel in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that we would never have thought possible. "
And Sami Khedira, after weeks of break for injury, advanced the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the " phenomenon " with the proverbial " wind " and the method of the new leader: " He is a man who action and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
But apparently Babbel had failed.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns the manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all.
As Gross, the players and the manager keep overstate the victory against a defence completely outdated and weakened Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 had reached the sad, Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, pointed that they had reached a goal of the season, the other was still very far.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt did not want to celebrate his birthday number 40, even after the first victory for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, the form of a television interviews before the start of the game that Jens Lehmann just match.
There are decisions taken by others, and not Jens, in response to the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had reproached weakness in the direction of the board, which had decided to change of coach by the pressure of fans.
Lehmann had also seen as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele that his day of free after the games has been deleted.
The statements of Lehmann were " marked by the pure selfishness, " Heldt and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They will Probably not friends for life, the two cuarentones.
But at least agreed with all the others In that, is to say that without the work of the group by the coach replaced, would not have been possible the strong idea.
Babbel and his assistants have been " a large part in the success, " said Heldt and Lehmann in chorus - and also the man in the plastic bag.

The case Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: the head of the group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the case of false information on the Case Kunduz.
The SPD and the Left demand explanation to the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - following the most recent revelations about the air attack in Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the Defence Minister Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) , have cheated with knowledge of the facts.
The Minister said the deadly bombing of two on Saturday, transmitted by the television channel ARD, the head of the Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, said in the news programme ".
This means that he lied.
The order to kill was in breach of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF) .
This is the essence of the report that had the NATO, and that has been read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not just to destroy the trucks kidnapped, but also to kill two Taliban leaders.
In the air attack According to investigation report of NATO, 142 people had been killed or injured was launched at the request of the German Colonel Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the left on Saturday called for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) , immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy of the and if the Chancery, the army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and the colleague from the Greens Renate Künast.
The government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The chancellor did not exert any influence on concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, also had transcended misgivings about the presentation by the Ministry on the reasons for the dismissal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to the information from the Spiegel, both had reported to correct and completely against the backdrop of the attack on the convoys.

So far it has not received a response, it says.
The ministry said on Saturday, not to the accusations and pointed out that will be in the Committee of inquiry of the Bundestag, which formed next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some people see, awake, images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill or under the influence of drugs, the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms, we can do without hindrance to the wildest fantasies.
However, awake, experienced the dream, hear and see things that others do not see or in the Western world to be crazy or drugged, or at least to be an original.
But such images and voices arise not only in the mentally ill or under the influence of drugs.
The blame our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, but that the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality.
The states of consciousness A in the form of a dream, in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call them visions, and at worst madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect differ, the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the experiences of the prophet of the new Age Carlos Castaneda, the psychosis and hallucinations similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the neural messenger substances of communication in the brain - especially the dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline is disrupted and the interaction between different parts of the same.
Complex hallucinations and wahnhafte thoughts are very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity has no power over him
The relationship between madness and dream has occupied philosophers and doctors Since ancient times.
Aristotle realised hallucinations as a form of the dream in the state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, found in 1861, a " great similarity between the madness and the to Sigmund Freud the dream was " a psychosis, with all the absurdities, composed ".
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. transformed into a character.
His body is in two dimensions to the colours.
The gravity has no power over him, is floating near the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red as blood, showing teeth.
They are pursuing, with heavy boots and flameantes, cast against the walls, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Voices the walls and radio.
It can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and offend.
Henning T. snaps two cables from the stereo, knotet attached to form a noose and a hook attached to the ceiling.
It is rising on a loudspeaker and sets the noose around the neck.
The.
The rope was.
What you will serve as a lesson, the voices in a chorus to extract the eardrums, " sees the clinic and do you cure! "
Today Henning T. 40 years, he lived six acute psychosis, the last 2 years ago, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive paranoid psychosis, moreover, it is, he takes medication, against The depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
In the psychosis I have experienced the most terrible worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The illusions are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in a life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics is the most common illness after the depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, people can no longer tell the difference between the inside and the outside world, they are in a state of anxiety that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, megalomania, relational or persecution.
Particularly widespread is the hearing voices: voices that give orders, command, or dialogue.
The optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person can no longer able to distinguish what is trivial, the brain can the important and no longer filter the disturbing signals, awareness is awash with impressions.
As the dream, the psychosis opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deeper layers of conscience.
The perception of reality in the psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas fox, head of the Department of Psychiatry in the Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is in the centre of the situation, everything has a meaning focused on him.
At the same time it is found in a passive role, as in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot act on them actively.
That is why the schizophrenic often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust the reality to them, the illusions are a cruel reality, wake up is excluded.
Having experienced a once in the life of a hallucination.
Unlike in the dream, says fox, " the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in the psychosis, basically. "
The thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real framework.
Why does exactly our brains antics, researchers are still a puzzle.
Exceptional conditions can bring everyone to lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinants.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explained fox.
But it remains unclear how this alteration of the neural system, which occurs and the fact that it is not for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis, because they interfere with the neurotransmitters.
When our brains.
This is crazy, Psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and says professor of psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck is that the order to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to obtain.
The perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a question of The point of view.
Kasten collects for ten years reports of hallucinations and visions and has analysed the results in the book his the unreal world in our head published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms of psychosis, but also an impressive number of many other diseases.
These include mental disorders, such as borderline or depression but also epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease diseases such as migraine, and head injuries.
It is surprising that in certain conditions even the brains of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, composed of fragments of memories that normally are inhibited.
They Arise when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are hyperactives or are little; when our brains hot, but also when there is a lack of stimulation.
The drugs can trigger this state in The same way that the brain damage or a psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, the evil of love or other mental states.
In recent studies have been up to a third of those polled said that at least once in the life of a hallucinations.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg - Western Pomerania and it goes to the school.
A normal girl.
If it were not for the images and voices.
During the break, it can happen that a schlaksiger boy with long, dark hair and runs the floor.
When she replied his comrades, surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They believe that the timid girl is a ensoñadora a little strange, but Sarah K. not dreaming, it is certain.
It is awake, hear and see the boy as she sees and hears the girl who is sitting next to her on the bench.
They can feel his presence even, at least a few moments.
It is a pleasant feeling, like the boy.
Am I crazy? , asks them sometimes.
But she knows that this young and the other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
The visions are often a burden.
When it is in class sometimes it can follow the course because the professor in their eyes and ears is presenting a new colleague, while for the rest it is invisible to others and that the mathematical equations.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room to reach the dream, which is far too little and too late, they often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or dreaming, if the images we see, the faces grimaçants or the girl with arms and legs, with the bleeding before their eyes open or closed.
Let me in peace, they are the characters.
Parents and friends told them nothing, which would be crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
Approved last year selectivity and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations have stopped.
Since it came into contact via the Internet with the psychologist Kasten, she knows that she is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
When a person is socially isolated or suffers a restriction of incentives, it is very likely that after a certain time.
I assume that the brain is not enough, that there is animation.
Sarah K., daughter, had little fear of other children and often played alone.
Their hallucinations began when, with 13 years, learned that the man she called Daddy since it was in age, was not his biological father.
As visual and acoustic hallucinations the same brain areas are active in the the real impressions and noise, it is affected as Sarah K. difficult to distinguish between vision and reality. " experience, " says place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten, dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike the schizophrenic, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their views as unrealistic.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish the hallucinations as a special talent.
Border state between dream and hallucinations
In our world too focused on the much bewusstseinszentrierten imaginary experience often, generally patologizarse, says Michael Schmidt - degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief of the clinic and psychotherapy of Florence Nightingale hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious disease, painful but which also contains something positive, creator - the madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt - degenhard has investigated the so - called oneirismo, a particular form of form of awareness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
The experienced oniroïdes are very complex semi - dimensional, detailed and that the person who are seen as real by the lives and that it cannot differentiate the dream even when it is awake.
The state of consciousness oniroïde occurs during a trauma or in extreme situations of illness, as for example in patients with polyradiculopathie fully aware, experiencing a motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt - Degenhard, when a person is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and permanent inability to move, it replaces the real situation its own imaginary world, the reality is, says that by
A kind of border state between dream and hallucinations.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
An intensive form of to give meaning and interpretation to an intolerable situation in itself that our own ability allows us not to sink into nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
Also The art historian Peter Cornelius Classen, describes his experiences in his book " change of heart " as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years, when his conscience embarked on trips of several days after the operation of a heart valves with a heart transplant included, while his body was sentenced to immobility in the intensive care.
Claussen are in a world created by the same and visited places foreign travel in time. It old man in bed, in a sanatorium rail, a robot for his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages of nobles who drugs from blood.
He was abducted by a Greek on the motorcycle in his home country, surfing with his hospital bed in the Alps and meeting a Korean mafia.
It absorbs completely in this imaginary world, everything is real, even later in the memories.
These internal travel For Claussen fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
They are much more distinct and more intensive than the real experiences.
The intensity of this experience the horizon of the rest of our other everyday experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt - degenhard.
Ultimately, the oniroïdes, psychosis, hallucinations and drugs show how fragile our internal figures of external reality in the even when we are awake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, " can lead to a distortion of what we call reality. "
An experience which might also be enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
The children will take charge of the publishing house with 27 years
The new publishing chief Kallen is an interim solution: in the long run will be Hubert Burda in the hands of his two children, he said the Spiegel.
100% of The holding will be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg - the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of their children in the long term.
The two children become heirs with 27 years and have The firm will to enter the companies, said Hubert Burda, 69, Spiegel.
The details have been managed as a precautionary measure.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will.
Also, if they are able to do so.
You can not put in front of 7,500 workers to their children, if they are not sufficient.
This brings the children, and the company.
Burda said last Thursday that he was withdrawing from January by the presidency of the board and that Paul - bernhard Kallen has been appointed as his successor.
Kallen, 52, is a member of the Board since 1999.
First It was responsible for the technology.
Later came with the Treasury's responsibility for the corporate wealth and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer capital also took charge of the direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, is not a member of the family at the head of the Verlages.
The children of crude have 19 and 17 years. his son Felix, which is now 42 years, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to bridge the differences of 10, 15 years, " according to gross.
100% of the holding will be in the hands of the family.
With regard to The cases Schickedanz and Schaeffler said Burda that family businesses folding certain: " it was always capital, which have families who have been infected by a that they could rise higher.
That has never been my strategy.
I have never had " delusions of grandeur, " said Burda.
I do not see it as a politician in this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play in the world league with the Time, these businesses have become too big.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to watch his e - mail, without offering the possibility to see some kind of attachments or surf the Internet.
It has Enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
It is to see on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea is interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low, less than half of what it costs, for example, the subscription data of the iPhone.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service data for life, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is as limited as its American counterpart, but comes with a surprise.
The price of monthly maintenance, approximately 12 euros a month, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphones already know what it is like to have to give up the data when it crosses the border or desperately seeking a cafeteria with WiFi (or a connection of Fon) to be able to consult his mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and for a long time that it should operate.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand and good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe have had a barely perceptible effect.
Outside the country of origin are afraid to use the data, and rightly so.
That A small device such as FonPeek (and it is always amazing that it has the name of Fon when it lacks WiFi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are starting to think differently and studying different proposals to make their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes the downloading of books and other research on the Internet.
Without contracts and without bagpipes.
It is a device connected and pay for it at the time of purchase, and not every month.
And that is what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, an option to purchase with access for life as Peek already in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I watch my mail on my phone, thank you.
I hope so, because I believe that it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The preferred colour of Michelle
Yellow is, without doubt, the favourite colour of the American first lady of the United States.
The inauguration of Barack Obama as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of this colour, has chosen the same to accompany him in, without doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has taken a model very similar in the two occasions: in addition to being a similar colour - yellow verdoso with brilliant reflexes twice the dress was composed of three parts: the dress, jacket and the same tissue, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So much so that at first glance, it appears that the first lady of the United States followed the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat the same.
But the fabric in which are cut both sets makes them very different.
If for the inauguration of was a fat, in Oslo is a velvet with.
Also The accessories were different: the first time green shoes tacón again, and a similar model, but, this time.
The hairdressing also has changed: the hair were put on this occasion as hair the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had problems because of their maternity
The Discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
It reveals the study " fertility and professional career women in Spain ', produced by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of women.
The survey conducted on 9 737 women aged 15 to 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working mothers saw their career opportunities in the workplace because of motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of life in a couple and the number of children, depending on whether or not the women work and the type of work.
Those who do not work outside the home, working part - time work or have a stable, starting before couple, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
By contrast, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delaying the coexistence and maternity, and have fewer offspring.
" Women between 35 and 49 years with a fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after being only the drawing, a figure that rises to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work exerts great influence on motherhood, although less about the timing of the pairing, " explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widening the gap in the age of marriage for women and to have the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the more they marry and have their first child.
The difference is also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years, those who have elementary and higher were respectively mothers for the first time to 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
" There is, depending on their level of education, another difference between the women.
While those with elementary school, marry and have their first child before finding stable employment, those of average levels or higher invest this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable work as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child, " said Delgado.
Diane Kruger also worth
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand, the universal currency " because I wish ".
The protagonist of " Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses of the international stage, thus joins other famous as well as Paris, Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Before it, the last to join the exclusive club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (" lost ") and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire ') .
Among men, the cosmetics brand also ambassadors of luxury: Patrick Dempsey (" Grey Anatomy ') and Matthew Fox (the colleague of Evangeline in lost) .
The price of the British fashion
The British have much to say in the world of fashion.
Its highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met in the annual delivery of their awards, which took place in London, the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
The former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected best model of the year.
The poker of Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vicent presented in " poker Asse " (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) thirty X - rays of writers who have crossed his literary life (and, in some cases, his other life) .
It does not gender predictable and apprehended (biographical profiles, life and work) , but looking for something similar to the core of ignition of the character creator.
The trip is exciting and Vincent saves scares or the illuminations.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to readings and relecturas.
Here I leave you a few snapshots.
On Albert Camus: " in its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, the same as I felt without name: the pleasure against the sad fate, the morality without guilt and innocence without any God. "
On Samuel Beckett: " nihilistic, Christian, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humour, pointless, as the blade of the knife that was about to kill him. "
On Graham Greene: " Our man was inspired by this woman with a passion that lasted 13 years, in whose meat the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege which was to reach the sky On the road to perdition. "
On James Joyce: " the Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand metres of world literature, he must climb by the north face, on the wall, from which it again and again the best. "
On William Faulkner: " It was a strange type.
In itself, he said that it was the heir of a landowner in the county and other times he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams of greatness. "
On Louis - Ferdinand Céline: " This writer took the cry pushed from a bridge by the personality of Munch to carry its response to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and did so in a trip fleeing itself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms. "
On Dorothy Parker: " One day brought to its knees and prayed: " God, I beg you to do that I write as a woman. "

Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years of age was walking by our neighbourhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent with her and our dog, a sang - mélé, rescued the perrera and with no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they hit him two kicked that left the dog seriously injured.
Our outrage is great because we do not find the fun in a gratuitous attack to a small and defenceless animal, which of course, was on a leash.
Add to this the indignation of a woman who was walking quietly and that, when these individuals came to fear for their physical integrity, as a attack an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or, weaker than him.
The incident occurred at 5 p. m. on a Tuesday as another in a normally quiet.
The dog was crying all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt that serve much and not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly killers were Spaniards.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to consider fun free of charge to a defenceless animal that we love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and people.

The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for road safety (Fesvial) , has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, mainly among the younger motorcyclists, reported today the two structures.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of the helmet, since it is the only element of protection to prevent injuries to the head, or even death in the event of an accident in two wheels.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which " goes beyond the design and manufacture of products always safer " and said that it also contributes to this objective by other actions to educational and informative.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets in the motorcycle, under the slogan " to be or not to be ', will have a first phase posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, in order to ensure the widest possible dissemination.

The sale of light commercial
After Almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the manufacturers ' association Anfac and sellers Ganvam.
However the good news, since the reference for comparison, the month of November 2008, was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% on the previous year.
However, despite the surge in the last month, the accumulated during the 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95.853 units have been sold together all vehicles that make up the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, pick up, vans, pickup trucks, vans and light trucks/chassis.
Furthermore, have not gone away the clouds that most affect their demand, although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium - sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions implied by the limitation of bank loans, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
Faced with this situation and unlike the passenger cars, aid for the purchase of the 2000E.
In addition to individuals, the self - employed and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicles of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions than 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, in Ganvam reminded the need for the administration to devote special attention to these vehicles and also to the industrial vehicles (trucks and buses) .
The dealers association of predicts a similar to the year 2010, for which estimates a fall in sales (for passenger cars and 4x4s) of 19%.
The emergency brake is now mandatory
As happened with the anti - lock brakes ABS and as will happen with the ESP stability control systems on the emergency will have to be a compulsory element in European cars.
In fact, They are already in all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while the rest is set for a waiting period until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by its mode of action, it can also help prevent many rear shocks.
The assistant to the emergency brake is increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, the system detects by the driver.
But it does not always maintained the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for car Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not come to step on the brakes before the collision, and half of them had not the full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, revancha, requires the braking system, reducing the distance that used the car to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with greater - it is estimated that the popularization of so - called intelligent emergency braking with damage to people - once the would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, helps to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device is the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize the damage.
General Motors delayed until January the plan for Opel
While the workers at the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - the 8 - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warned that it will need more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is that each of the points of the plan has been approved in advance by the party.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be submitted to the workers and then the governments of the countries in which there are factories, be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
However, GM, it ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the US manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits being in contact with some potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch manufacturer of sports cars, which is backed by the Russian group Converg.
In the case where there would agree with any of them, GM could sell some assets of Saab to the Chinese Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For his last, and expensive jewel, engineers of Porsche took the Boxster S as a base and that adelgazase nothing less than 80 kilos, which has left the báscula in only 1,275 kilograms.
This has led to happen, first, the automatic roof has been replaced by a roof manual, to reduce 21 kilos, using aluminum doors as the GT3, ' other 15; the climatizador, 13; the fuel tank of 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilograms 12 and with the slight of 19 inches, five.
Finally, they have renounced the audio system Cdr - 30, winning six kilograms and have replaced the doors for each question, the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the Doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK available, the test was carried out on a unit with the manual box of six speeds, mainly for secondary roads of California, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous.
His behaviour can only be described as beyond reproach.
The weight does not prevent the car rolling on the floor with aplomb.
On the opposite: it was a long time that we had not a model so small and light that, at the same time, including at high speed.
It is a small athlete, able to heat their muscles in a short march during the time necessary, until we ask him to sprinter, to recover and return to squeeze its engine ...
It is out what we wanted. Through his leadership, as communicative as precise, the car will do what our hands on the steering wheel.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
His engine at will
The sound of his V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the option " sport " or through a system that changes the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The ability of acceleration is brutal, whether from unemployed or in recoveries.
The suspensions are strong, but not harsh or inconvenient.
The asphalt roads that we have travelled with the Boxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car meisterte the potholes.
The electronic assistants were barely act of presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves ice at dawn and gravel, later in the morning.
In short, a car, more fun to drive and that is much more than a simple amendment of the Boxster S.
The car will be on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70.831 euros.

Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the residence of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation no later than 27 January 2010, when his term officially end.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that " Mel " knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he has refugee from 21 September.
" He is aware that he must go on 27 January, at the end of his mandate, it must seek another destination. "

After the elections on 29 November (during which Porfirio Lobo was elected) , Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally failed, since Zelaya refused the status of exiled political intended to impose the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After days roses since last spring, during which the inflation of assets has been the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty there arises again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which the players take decisions on the future inherently uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize the markets was to monetize debt by the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
The Central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have virtually ended and, without questioning their heterodox policy of liquidity, begin to put some sand in the wheels, as did the ECB with its next week.
Therefore, investors have doubts about the ability of the global economy to an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock markets and the spreads on corporate bonds have rise again, although still a long way from the levels they achieved at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to socialize the risk private and public debt is affected.
There is a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, leading to an extension of the differences between the countries in the euro zone in regard to Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard& Poor's and threatened with a new downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of the moral hazard, who tried to provoke a case of conscience in global economic policy that had stalled the destructive effects of the credit on the destruction of employment, when what we should do is declare a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation of Dubai resembles a tribal fight between the sheiks to restore the power in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections and a new government, which is in the same direction.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the saves a breach of its external payments of the year and allow a member country of the euro area not to meet its commitments.
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and its citizens of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, would be within the Erwarteten.
In the case of Spain, as long as our differences of public debt increase to the obligations of European corporate should not worry.
If the European and continued to increase, it would be a special Spanish risk.
The Standard& Poor's is an anecdote. When our indicators are forcing the majority of services to anticipate their recovery and to revise upwards their forecasts for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, it does not much hope for their warning.
Again, this has to be an excellent opportunity to buy assets in Spain, although for the moment " caution ".

The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in the discussion these days the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by the chairman of gas Natural - Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, gave the press a few key points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
For the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and other 60 billion between that date and 2030, where nuclear power plants in operation today would remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments will not be $60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investments should not be used to increase the production capacity, but in distribution networks and international groupings.
From 2020, the issue is changing, and it will increase the power.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with mechanisms for recovery of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this case, it believes that 18,000 MW of more are needed, with other " energies of support. "
Galán, who believes that the draft law of sustainable economy that has just been adopted by the government is in line with what his company, did not want to attack the royal decree aimed to encourage the use of coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate change.
In his opinion, there is " a clear commitment to the long - term " in this sense, despite the measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola.
Be that as it may, believes that investment decisions, although they are in the long term, it must begin to taken, because they take some time and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.

Their participation in the Champions League reported 476,4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs, since its birth in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona since 476.4 million, putting them at the third and fifth place of clubs who have earned the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only the glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
So much so that the competition has distributed 5.362,5 million to the 105 teams (12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the founding of the tournament in the 1992-93 season, according to data from UEFA.
Real Madrid and The F. C. Barcelona have been well served in this distribution.
The club was the third of the continent to receive more money for his participation, and the only one, with the AC Milan, has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, the current champion and the last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is the fifth of the classification.

Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure of distribution of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1,090 million through the Champions League.
This money UEFA will devote 413,1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the classification matches (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have managed to participate received 3.8 million just to be there, in addition to other euros for each party.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team) . the octavofinalistas will receive three million each; the eight cuartofinalistas, 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each received 4 million.
The champion will earn $9 million, compared to the 5.2 million received by the other finalist.
So, in the form of fixed payments, a club at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, has pocketed $2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, which are scheduled for the 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional to the value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the key, and has four seats.
The champion of the previous year gets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid depending on the number of games they play in this year's edition, distributed.

A decision that in fact the first woman to hold a high position in the food companies.
It is a newly created position that will report directly to the president of the group.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged embezzlement of more than 230 million of SOS to other societies of the Salazar.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that in the next few months SOS reveals new misappropriation of funds
