European inflation slipped in food
Inflation accelerated, recorded in the euro zone, is due firstly to the rapid growth in the price of food products.
The rise in prices in the month of November has been higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro zone, recording - after 2.6% in October - an annual inflation of 3.1% - announced the statistical office of the Union based in Luxembourg.
The official forecasts were just as likely a 3% - announced the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), in contrast to the issuing banks American, British and Canadian, not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the reduction, together with rising prices of raw materials, and forced to reduce unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to 2%.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the trap 22: "We must negotiate" on inflation so that subsequently does not have to intervene in this issue.
Inflation of 3.3%, registered in Germany, beating the record of twelve years; whereas in Espana increased from 3.6 to 4.1%.
Inflation were shot in the euro zone as a result of the rampant food prices and energy.
Contributions term of wheat increased by 88% and also the price of soya reached its highest level since 1973.
Similarly, there were to pay much more in 2007 for the vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil in the world market increased this in a 52%, reaching already last month the black gold nearly 100 dollars a barrel.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 2.1% now to 2.5%, in exchange for the 2009 will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the annual inflation will remain in the next 3 or 4 months around 3%, but the annual average rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, it is expected that during the 2008 the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup provides for a government crisis
After a long stagnation, at the beginning of December the support of the Alliance of young Democrats rose significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, while the Gallup never before experienced such a low level - a 13% - in the case of the Socialists.
The difference in the case of the electorate sure of the parties, due to the greater strength of voters in the opposition - would mean a support of more than two-thirds (71%) in the face of the support of a fifth for the Socialists (20%).
According to the survey, the democratic forum and the alliance of free Democrats nor the limit necessary to take some Escano: its parliamentary support within the entire population is 2%.
Among voters insurance there is more than one per cent supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even in comparison with the previous lowest point - has never been so high, 41% the proportion of those who judged particularly bad the economic situation in the country, while another 46% believes that the situation is rather bad.
The families, after expectations more hopeful of the spring and the summer, are now more pessimistic about the change of their own economic situation.
With regard to the next, the majority of the population has the deterioration of the situation and only a tenth expected to improve.
In December, 71% of those questioned, a figure higher than any previous survey Gallup, estimated that the head of government Desempena more harm than good.
13% of consulted trusts or Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of consulted.
A 54% of the population does not trust it all in the head of government and a 27% does not trust the President of the Alliance of young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the shape of the political situation is that, what proportion of the society thinks that it is possible to monitor the discontent experienced in the face of the person of the head of government without a change of government.
While after the riots in October last 35% believed that it would be desirable to maintain in power the government and the head of government, currently this proportion is only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) believes that the only solution is new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterised by the fact that 60% of respondents to the question on the participation replied that surely would participate and another 20% said that it is likely to be involved.
As a comparison, in "a general election to be held this Sunday" participate with security only 55% of the population and another 15% think likely their participation. On the basis of the current intentions of the voters there can be no doubt of the outcome of the referendum.
74% of the population paying the rights of studies, 79% of the service of medical consultations and a 84% of hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only between the participants insurance in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89% of the electorate would reject the introduction of the rights of studies, the payment for the medical consultations and of the care hospital.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco their prices
held the average increase of the level of prices of 16% supermarkets of the triangle commercial gold Budaörs, with the difference that this has not been an increase in the VAT.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This also rose by an average of 16% in the triangle trade gold Budaörs the Canasta usual Christmas Journal Napi, but in all supermarkets recorded a growth much higher than the thousand Huf.
As in December last had already been "fired" prices of food in supermarkets, this is not experienced a drastic increase percentage compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously terrifying for consumers the fact that what the past were able to buy at a price far below the nine thousand Huf today can not do or ten thousand.
The Canasta of Napi in supermarkets studied exceeded with a minimum of 91 Huf the psychological limit of ten thousand Huf.
And the Canasta of highest value was 10 573 Huf.
(in the 2003 that Canasta cost 6800 Huf.)
The price of spirits and fish remained almost at the level of the previous one, but there was a sharp increase in the steak of Pechuga of Turkey, nut and seed poppy.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in the Auchan we have found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 Huf.
Competition does not cut the price of the product to less than 200 Huf.
Equally surprising was in this shop that the price of Coca-Cola bottle with Redimible of two litres cost less than 200 Huf, so this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 Huf.
However, in the Canasta of Napi Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with regard to the prices of the Christmas of the past, Cora increased with 15, while Tesco and Auchan with around 18% prices in the Canasta of Napi.
Comparing the values of Canasta more expensive of the past with that of the cheapest Canasta of this, the difference has been a 12%, while growth between the cheapest of the past and the most expensive of this has been a 21%.
The average growth was 1480 Huf.
The past the average growth in prices was of 1206 Huf, so that during the Christmas of the past in prices was the increase in VAT.
It is precisely this process which was destroyed trade, supermarkets visibly were unable to take a decision on the room for prices to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of the change of prices on consumption.
(if the trader planning badly the speed of the movement of a product, stands to lose an important benefit in the margin which is in line with sales figures.)
The increase in the price of the Canasta of Napi reached such extremes as a result of the increase in the VAT, which is the most expensive was higher with 1720 Huf to the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheaper The difference was just a Huf.
This not there were such extremes, given that the highest price of now has been 1630 Huf more than the past and the cheapest also increased with 1284 Huf.
Comparing the two seasons Navidenas, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in supermarkets grew more than 30% the price of consumer articles basic necessities.
(But this does not necessarily confirms the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some basic foodstuffs recorded in the interval of 12 months an increase in price of over 30%.
For example, in addition to the wheat, also in the case of the chicken.)
According to the Canasta of Napi, in the latter case that seems almost impossible, because the price of this product that was quite expensive because the past compared to the basis, there was, in the worst case, only a 10% increase in prices.
According to all the indicators, suppliers of meal have a stronger position than those of egg, and could impose the dramatic increase in prices even the multinationals.
Supermarkets not complain in the triangle trade of gold, talk constantly about positive results.
According to our experience, the majority of consumers of the three shops visited, already are not interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, and by Paletas food preserved.
In the Manana on Wednesday, in the three shops are formed huge queues ahead of the boxes because suddenly increased the number of customers.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country the volume of sales are lower, many multinationals complain institutes survey because incomes are below their plans, and not just in the case of food, but also for the household appliances.
In many hospitals saves with disinfectants
This has been made in hospitals several thousand infections produced in the first place over their misuse of antibiotics.
The circumstances of hygiene prevailing in hospitals, overcrowding of beds and pollution staff not encourage the control of infection - says the Médica-jefa unit of the national centre for epidemiology.
In many hospitals saves even with the disinfectants.
Not long ago has been diagnosed an infection with MRSA in the department of Traumatología the hospital János.
In a man in hospital after a serious accident was detected the presence of bacteria resistant to antibiotics.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in the same hospital at the beginning of the Minister.
A wounded a serious car accident gave high of the hospital and the same patient shortly after due to return to the hospital as a result of infection with MRSA and since then we have not been able to make an important surgical intervention by the presence of bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December this has been made in the national system Nosocomialis surveillance 1094 cases of infection hospital produced by agents - said Karolina Böröcz, Médica-jefa unit of the national centre for epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals certainly there has been this number of infections caused by agents, of the rest do not have the information.
Nearly two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, staphylococcus aureus resistant to the Meticilina-oxacilina.
A third of human beings have been in its nose of bacteria staphylococcus aureus (SA) without causing disease.
Infections caused by the SA (for example: inflammation of the throat, Amigdalitis, skin infections, infections of wounds) are reacting well to antibiotics and are easily treatment.
However, once implemented exaggerated or unduly antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics, it becomes very bacteria resistant to antibiotics and quickly in a position hospital inadequate.
Can cause serious infections, for example hospital infections of wounds firstly patients with immune deficiency transitional or chronic, patients with weakened the body, the elderly or people of little weight.
In view of the Médico-director the hospital János there is nothing special in the infection MRSA, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, the only MRSA is absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where there is examined its presence.
Which is resistant to antibiotics
"these patients are isolated, nursing staff in Goma gloves and mask and there are suited to antibiotics treatment" - said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients hospitalized are being examined prior to verify the presence of the MRSA in his body, but not even in this way can we avoid the infection in all cases.
It is fashionable not take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections of the MRSA in most cases, but the current circumstances hospital not encourage national training and for the prevention of infection with the pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and homes for the elderly, hospitals should examine patients hospitalized and isolate immediately Enfermes in his body the MRSA.
However, in hospitals Hungarians is not fashionable the microbiological sampling.
This is also due to the box national health not financed these medical examinations.
So the majority of cases come to light public when there are already infections of the MRSA visible in the patient - said the Médica-jefa of department of central epidemiological.
The European Union is rigorous Encomiendas for the implementation of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also directives to deal with the national infections and tables disease.
We must Empenarse that therapy with antibiotic be addressed, that is, should be done microbiological tests to prevent resistance to medicines, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
The sampling microbiological are even less frequent in the case of patients or assistance basic - said Karolina Böröcz.
SAVE with the disinfectants
scientific experiments have shown that in most cases the MRSA infect a patient to another through medical staff.
Therefore, a very important role Desempenan laundering of hand, the use of rubber gloves and masks, but also in this regard are experiencing considerable errors in hospitals.
The MRSA through the transmission by drops and the direct contact between people, but in the circumstances national hospital is not always possible to isolate the patient infected.
What is more, the rooms hospitals are often overcrowded, beds are often very together, but to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated by at least a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately may have also added - Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals of less favourable economic situation saves with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and that is why there is a greater likelihood for the infection.
In view of Karolina Böröcz, where they meet the appropriate measures of prevention, there are less infections such or can halt the spread of the pathogen.
Programme governmental against MRSA
The treatment of infection with MRSA is a huge expenditure for the fund national health insurance, so that in all countries fight against him.
In Britain, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce the cases of the MRSA.
It appears that the programme has successes, according to the data provided, infection with MRSA show trend of reduction in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has on its agenda the prevention of actors (among these the MRSA) and that of the hospital infections are due to these pathogens.

Bulgaria, paradise property of the EU
It is admirable development of the property market Bulgarian - the attention of the whole of Europe is heading for this Balkan country before little mentioned.
What, where and those who buy in the market even cheaper EU, will rise quickly?
analysis of the division of Bulgarian re / Max.
The objective preferred to takeovers property in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap flats of ski slopes and the villa of the beaches.
The regions Montanosas of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most favourite, whereas in the beaches Albena, the "golden coast," the "coast of the sun", the former Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people looking for buildings in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts re / Max in Bulgaria sooner or later, also the central part of the country - as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people buy property in the area especially cheap.
Similarly can be attractive the capital Sofia, commercial spaces and offices promise a quick return on investment.
Bulgaria is in the best way to become one of the most commendable havens of golf of Europe, and could be a destination also highlighted during the other two stations, as well as the summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the view of analysts, those who buy property in Bulgaria, are trying to change their lives and their way of life.
The majority of customers are English, but are also of France, Belgium, and increasingly Espana of Romania.
Also present promoters Maltese and Cypriot and traditionally there are many customers Russians on the beaches of the Black Sea and ski havens.
Customers foreigners can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, Director of regional re / Max in Bulgaria.
Those seeking to settle here buy property at a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15, 000 euros, to renew them then.
Require good communication and access, as well as for them is important proximity of a big city, shops and generally of a local doctor.
Constitute the second category purchasers of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 holiday destinations of Germans).
The third group are real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefit in the medium or long term.
The price of property Capitalinos is in constant growth, since the demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has home prices lower, in the last five years these suffered an annual increase of 21%
The increase in the price of property exceeds considerably wage growth.
Fodor and for the six hundred Hungarians
According to informed the Minister for the environment and Hidrología Gábor Fodor meetings at expert level be completed on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official opening negotiations will continue at ministerial level on the international climate regime post - 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world deliberate on the road map of Balí available on the efforts after the period of emission reduction, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, valid until 2012.
At the present time are carried out lively discussions on the particularly among developing countries and the industrialised.
The United States has already indicated that for the time being does not want to negotiate on precise figures, although tends to reach an agreement that compared with the situation in 1990, until 2020 decline with 25 to 40% emissions of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect.
Another major theme of the conference is that if the industrialized countries, as well as reducing emissions, or are not prepared to provide assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was reached in addition offer on aid to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a board of directors made up of 16 members, probably within the global fund for the environment of the UN (GEF) - writes the "Piac."
The six by hundreds of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the environment minister and Hidrología Gábor Fodor supports the efforts of the EU to maintain its leading role in the global protection of the climate and promoting the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reduce by 2020, with regard to the 1990 level by 20% their emissions of gas, responsible for the greenhouse effect will be signed, regardless of whether or not the post - 2012 "and is ready to engage to reduce as high as 30%, when the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries in line with their responsibility and their skills.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that are signatories to the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 undertook to reduce 5.2%, within this the then 15 EU Member States committed themselves to meet an 8% reduction.
The commitment of Hungary is decreasing with 6% gas emissions responsible for the greenhouse effect with regard to the period between 1985 and 87, that our country will fulfil - Senala the press release of the Ministry of the environment.
Much is at stake in Balí, given that in two years we will have to sign the agreement international climate policy in the longer term, because if we do not, it is certain that its entry into force would continue after 2012. In this case the reduction commitments it made in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international system of reducing emissions, the need for which was perceived in its most recent report by the IPCC, Association international scientific UN dealing with climate change, which won the Nobel Prize for Peace.
Thus, the reduction of emissions would suffer a delay and could not prevent an increase of over 2 or C of the average temperature of the earth, According to scientists would have consequences unimaginable and irreversible.
The British army recruited in Youtube
units of the army in a British distributor of videos published recordings on actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularise themselves.
First the British air force (RAD) was which took advantage of the services of Youtube: the special units displaced in Afghanistan since the March 2006 are burden videos on their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras riding on the helmets are monitored the body's general operations of Kandahar, then are sent to London to be loaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
are already 139 recordings from air force soldiers who have been charged in this way to the Internet and its "channel" has been seen by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Defence Ministry was recorded in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defence" and published videos both of actions perpetrated in Iraq as in Afghanistan, while both the Ministry of the Community of Nations (British Commonwealth Office) as the multinational forces in Iraq (Mnfi) have their own channel Youtube.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had loaded the videos with objectives of recruitment, but in the view of the Ministry of Defence also serve to present to the public the real objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
This kind of propaganda practically costs nothing compared to the TV spots conventional recruitment - told the BBC the expert on defence Gordon Mackenzie - on the other hand, inevitably have a political message, since in a specific way justify the raison d'être of the military action decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a videogame
The army is also concerned by the fact that, in addition to the recordings Recelosamente published and criticized, in the distributor are also videos fans, for example on the death of the soldiers: in the films of propaganda "official" a little hypocritical, officers speak a maximum of losses, however, without presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan have borne the Internet already numerous videos enshrined in real operations, but the British army only recently is taking advantage of this opportunity.
The Americans used a slightly different for recruitment with the free Descargables video games of gunfire so-called America's army, where in the midst of a situation more or less real player can be directly instead of soldiers.
And Pastelillo in the Christmas party of ministries
It does not seem very sentimental Minister working Mónika Lamperth: instead of the Party Navidena, held a working meeting to his colleagues who will be able to dismiss the 2007 with Pastelillo and coffee.
There is Ministry to be held by his party with live music, in another will create the atmosphere Navidena at the heart of public officials with and wishful thinking.
Party atmosphere of Christmas, concerts and Buffet - this is amused power.
Also the offices of the state are preparing to Christmas.
Most Christmas party will be held in the Ministry of Defence, but not for the workers in the Ministry.
In the Christmas of orphans receive gifts the children of soldiers killed and to the Christmas missionaries are invited to the relatives of the soldiers who currently meet missions abroad. Also will be given a reception for the press.
This portfolio allocated 25 million for the end of the festive atmosphere.
The national agency for the promotion (Anf) and the Ministry of Economics and transport (ETF) held a party luxurious with regard to the celebrations the other portfolios
The party of the ETF will be held in the House of the future, with a total budget of 4 320 000 Huf and six hundred workers from the Ministry is expected the presence of about three hundred and fifty.
In the Party of the portfolio reign an atmosphere of Christmas, act also artists and there will be lots of raffle.
The Christmas of the Anf cost 4 700 000 Huf and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of administration of justice (Cnaj) with music concerts and dinner.
The rent for the room cost a million Huf, the rest of the budget was spent for more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers in one of the departments Anf are also invited to another Christmas party that held a Companía management of competitions so-called Hungarian centre for economic development of Community funds.
For this objective hired complete the building of the theatre of comedy.
The information has not been confirmed by Chde SA, because we can not communicate with the person responsible.
You can attend without clothes
The building of the Cnaj not only hosted the feast of the Anf, but that of the Ministry of Justice and the police, rather than the Christmas celebrated the dance of the day on 7 December.
The Cnaj of them do not gained anything by the use of its facilities.
In the dance participated five hundred people.
The party began with the words of welcome to the Minister and after dinner there was music Bailable live.
In response to the question of [] Origo informed: to attend dancing was not compulsory dress suit or dress at night.
The portfolios of health, employment and local administrations are preparing for celebrations modest.
The Ministry of public health will organise a programme and a party for their workers in their own building with a budget of EUR 400 000 Huf.
On the other hand, the Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth does not expect his colleagues to a party official Navidena, but to the end of a working meeting.
It has the participation of one hundred and eighty guests that - as informed the Department of the press - take just coffee and Pastelillo, so that the party will not cost more than 350 000 Huf.
The Minister for local governments, Gordon Bajnai instead simply provide with his colleagues in the classroom of the Ministry for local government and territorial development.
The Ministry of Finance (Mf) held a party Navidena in their own living room of acts 436 with the participation of workers.
The Party Navidena will have a budget of Huf by invited - this budget will be paid with the reception Buffet and wishful thinking.
Since János Veres is the Minister, workers in the Mf all celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official status will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also because of the timing of the afternoon.
The portfolio of agriculture will offer a reception of new 20 January, the Ministry is not held Christmas.
The reception will be held in the House of Vajdahunyad of the municipal park and according told the portfolio, there will be a budget Huf 1,000 per person for the 100 guests.
This, according to the department of the press - will be a reception very simple rose, to which will be invited only diplomats specialist, accredited in Hungary.
These receptions held all, start with a brief speech of welcome to the Minister and concludes with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and of education and culture does not take place no Christmas party - this is what I told the corresponding departments of the press to [Origo].
In the Department of press for the portfolio of environment were not able to report on the budget of the celebrations Navidenas of the Ministry.
What is known is that for the party to be held in the Museum of the arts applied were invited to more than four hundred people.
Will gather the forces of the strike giant
The Unions League and the Federation of national committees worker constitute Friday to strike a committee to coordinate the strike on Monday, which will last indefinitely.
On Saturday there will be a rally in protest, while on Monday - the day when the final vote to be held on the law of public health - unemployment will begin work.
Certainly this action will cause great difficulties in the transport, as this will stop completely transit rail and until 13 hours will be striking workers of the transport company collective of Budapest.
On the evening of Friday the Unions League will report on the details of their strike on Monday that take place in conjunction with the National Federation of committees worker.
It is also form the Committee on strike the League and the national trade union of train drivers that coordinated actions on Monday.
On Saturday there will be a rally of protest on Monday, while the trade unions participants on strike indefinitely, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - in the day of the parliamentary vote on the law on public health - not informed about the date of the end of the strike started.
If the National Assembly disapproves the law of public health, the trade unions immediately withdrawn its call to strike.
On the other hand, if the law is adopted, will meet the committees to strike and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda of the National Assembly on Monday it is also possible that only vote on the law on public health in the very p.m. tickets evening, or perhaps around midnight.
As a result of the strike beginning on Monday, it will be necessary to have significant difficulties in transport: on the railways are no longer work indefinitely, for the Manana can to a part of the public transport of Budapest and more than half of the bus of the Volán.
At the same time, in many parts of the country will have closure of half of the ways of the roads.
Many trade unions and civil organisations have joined the strike, their names are updated constantly on the website of the League.
Some trade unions announced their strike indefinitely, others for time defined.
Until Thursday afternoon rail State and the free trade Union of railway workers (Sltf) could not reach an agreement even on the minimum services, although, to meet the Christmas celebrations, more and more people travelling on trains.
According to information received to date from the start of the day until 13 hours will be on strike the company employs public transport in Budapest, Budapest airport until 9 Manana, hold a strike four hours' Unions League of the electricity industry and thermal energy, trade unions educators called strike 2 and the trade union democratic educators from 2 to 8 p.m.
The association of Hungarian doctors will vote in national strike in hours alternative and the democratic trade union of workers in the health sector and social (Sdtsss) that are part of the cooperation forum of trade unions, held a warning strike of two hours.
The most important of the four demands put forward by the League is that the Government withdraw its proposal on the reform of the public health and put a new concept to a social debate.
The second demand is to introduce gradually the new way of calculating pensions which will enter into force on next.
The third is to ensure, by 2010, even in the case of pensions advanced the possibility of occupations that deserve to come to the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the free trade Union of railway workers (Sltf) that is part of the trade unions in League, they do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economics and transport on lines railway and expect a different proposal.
Political capital: in the country increases the risk for the guard Hungarian
According to the division of risk analysis (analysing division) of the political capital the activity of the guard Hungarian, constituted in August of this with the support of the movement for a better Hungary, from various points of view has increased the political risk of Hungary and of the region.
In the "warning on risks" of the Companía is written: in relation to the activity of the guard Hungarian the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the worsening of ethnic tensions between the Roma population and not Roma of Hungary, even in the short term can be violent".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian guard is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - added the representative of the research institute.
Claimed that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists in the political life Hungarian: "the protagonists of public life I gave the public debate of the Roma problem to the representatives of the political groupings radical and extremists, who were able to base its policy strategy on the discrepancies between Roma and Hungarians."
This makes the problem worse, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - believe.
On top of that, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national average and international, "deteriorated significantly the image of Hungary abroad, especially in regard to the stability and democratic development of the country."
They remind us that: from Otono 2006 received more and more publicity and boost the reorganisation of radical groups and of extreme right in Hungary and that since the summer of 2007 have been set up in the country many organisations that of "associations of national self-defense."
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organisations, while the training of its members to the defence - even armed - (civil defence, national defense, protection of public order), referring to the inadequacies of the police, the army, in other words of the State" - add.
All this takes place in accordance with the method that tries to give a presentation civil different political aspirations, on the basis of the dissatisfaction of the society with politics and political parties.
Because highlight what civil and form of partnership in the case of these partnerships not only serves to avoid the legal problems of the legal status, but at the same time it is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the guard Hungarian is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, in many neighbouring States referred to the Hungarian guard as a potential danger, while the political figures Ultra-nacionalistas of certain neighbouring countries, want to justify its own policy Anti-húngara with the creation of the guard Hungarian.
All this has a bearing on the political stability of the region "- incorporated.
According to the research institute, the Constitution of the Hungarian guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that throughout the region were increased the political risks.
Wrote that the guard Hungarian works in such a way that for example the national guard Bulgarian, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 for the Bulgarian national Union (Unb) of the extreme right.
The Constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the riots mass of gypsies that took place in one of the suburbs of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the Unb decided to form the guard, on the grounds that the objective of the organisation is "national self-defense."
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was "terror" Roma in Bulgaria, but the state remained powerless and unresponsive in the face of the facts - is reminiscent of the political capital.
Incorporated: this initiative has provoked a lively discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As he wrote, indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes which certain organisations Roma in Bulgaria have announced that to resist, will form its own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian guard so far has shown similarities with the Bulgarian National Guard, can not be excluded that the Roma of Hungary react to the threat in a similar way, by organising its own self-defense - can be read in the warning about the risks of the political capital.
The director of research of the political capital, Attila Juhász to the question of the news agency said: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each published its risk analysis and when they experience something that can have an impact on the change of the risk, inform the public, as happened in this case, publishing its warning about the risks.
The party is not always writes with red
In Hungary the law defines precisely the days are written with red in the timetable and already has become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that the next will be less - reorganise working hours.
Even in the EU or in North America are uniform parties.
The laws Hungarian make a difference between national holiday, feast of State and days.
Hours mainly relate to Christmas religious and historical anniversaries.
The new also: both the last day of the old, as the first day of the new is festive - the latter especially for those who spent celebrating the old.
Throughout the holidays written with red in the timetable.
It is a national holiday on 15 March in memory of the revolution of 1848 and the 23 October, Memorial Day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August welcome the founding of the state, on 1 May or the feast of work or, on 1 and 2 November or we remember our relatives and friends who have died.
Moreover, in our country are celebrations two days the Easter of resurrection, the whit and the Christmas.
According to the timetable, our celebrations State, national or religious rarely coincide with a weekend, so often makes bridge when before or after the party there is only one working hours.
In exchange for the weekend Alargados as well, for on Saturday prior you can not leave work or school.
Is the Minister of Labour that regulates in its decree specific when work needs to be done exactly in exchange for time directly precedent or subsequent to the Party.
This rule is legal compliance compulsory for all employers and for their employees, as well as for the employees and public servants.
It is not compulsory in exchange for companies and institutions of services which, due to their role, work even during the days.
This the rules of procedure can be altered only around the end of parties: from 24 December virtually stop life in the country, because according to experience, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the or take their holidays during these days.
The next number of our Christmas to coincide with the middle or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working hours which this.
First will be changed agenda on the feast of work and then, for four days, successive workers.
On Saturday, 26 April will be working hours, that in return for Friday 2 may be hours.
The other change is related to the feast of 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, we will have to work instead of 24 on Friday.
On the other hand, the next during the holiday in order to be able to rest, as from 24 December not work almost anywhere, even if the last day is a Wednesday.

lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car is moving slowly in the usual backlog of the Manana.
Sounds a compass Extrano on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
Subo volume.
Changing the pace of the music and the previous tones is added the low and then the voice of a female chorus as a real gem intervenes.
Mr Channel 2 reproduces the song wings of love of Zagar.
Life musical us national Malcrió much with POP electronic quality.
But now it seems quite different this traffic jam when you are listening to the new disk of Zagar.
Appears Yonderboi. Some new and interesting songs of the digital underground national will gradually changing the image and although it is fashionable again rock style garage, breaks Guitarras, the electro pop national has shown: there are developments in the sun.
Zságer began his career in the city of Pécs, fell throughout Yonderboi until began his career independent perhaps because both can not be protagonists of a single whole.
With its project (Zagar) and its music, a mixture of jazz, of music electronic Bailable and pop, tried to succeed, when asked Soundtracks cinema (Pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider public experienced the joint initially acted only in clubs Pequenos when the magazine wan 2 selected his first disc published in 2002 between the fifty discs national most important, classifying to Zagar, together with Yonderboi as almost the only training national trends, able to be sold in western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and a whole are fashionable, but no one has been asked whether or not I am happy to this label.
The joint reacted as must react: prepared a disc new and even better.
The disc newly launched, entitled instead can open up new paths for them, although the very title aims to provide continuity with the initial in the town of Pécs.
Since this title was one of the lines of the whole of former Zságer.
The reference is well on the successful, on the flight, but also as successful music, now appeared - and the trend in the spirit of the time - the Guitarra that sounds more strong, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs presented the disk in the Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer currently working in England with all the puzzle.
In the disc includes a real success of the channel Mr 2 Petõfi recently transmitted the Manana night popular music. This station led to the ears of the Radioyentes music of high flight wings of love, engraved with six singers Hungarian ($Ivas underground ").
Because everything is in order (?).
Hvg. Hu asked Zságer.
Hvg. Hu: after this new success which the question arises: what you are interpreting, to what extent is a music dedicated to a public select?
Zságer: the definition of public select for me means little.
In my view there are two types of caste music lightly; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but trade and sincere.
Also the so-called alternative music underground can be boring, senseless and can be made up equally only for the sale, which makes trade.
But it is also a good pop song can arise from a sincere inspiration.
Also the attitude of the listeners works in this spirit, irrespective of languages and national borders.
Hvg. Hu: you see any difference between the reception of your music on the part of the public Hungarian and foreign?
B. Zs: abroad, especially to the West of us, the music is slightly larger traditions.
This not only generations of 15 to 20 frequent the concerts, but also the old.
Pay much more attention to the changes in around in the music lightly, because we see it as part of the contemporary culture.
Hvg. Hu: what role has the public in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are and how many people who are listening to your music?
B. Zs: of course I am well to see that more and more people attending to our concerts.
But we have ever composed music to the market.
Not in music for some goal, but for some reason.
The role of the public rather is felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the changes inconceivable of the time.
And yet, I realised that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, lose their interest.
Hvg. Hu: to what extent Pretendes follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and made his career on the west of us.
B. Zs: we do not follow their way, despite the fact that sometimes try to compare our music with him.
Rather, we are working as a team, we hope in the presence of the other music and let it unfold.
Originally it was inevitable that compare our work with the music of Yonderboi, as many of us are beginning our race within your group and hence embarked another way.
Hvg. Hu: on the list of successes of Mr 2 Petõfi wings of love is in the first place.
Many people heard for the first time on behalf of Zagar on this song.
What Abriste Concientemente with this style into a broader layer?
Zs. B.: not intended comprise great successes and sell at these successes our disc.
This song is something more than that.
The added at the end of the disc, trying to relax after the orgy noise of the disk and the most heavy.
Hvg. Hu: how do you have selected the six singers?
Why precisely to them - what was the main reason?
B. Zs: the idea was to create a chorus in the style gospel.
Then came the idea of creating this chorus of helpings of good voice of our own scenario music national.
It was set up this chorus of six women - in other words seine, Kutzora Edina, Judie, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [and] Juci Németh - that was then dubbed as Divas of underground.
Hvg. Hu: Compusiste exactly the song or girls changed some things?
Zs. B.: this song there was a long time in version instrumental and when we had already all the material of the disc, we believe that we still have something.
The line attracted the song.
Even that night recorded the song that later learned the girls.
Virtually all the first attempt and in the form incredibly spontaneous.
I remember, I very much time, but of course also needed the Divas.
My voice had not worked with such force.
Hvg. Hu: both the concert and the disc seems as if the girls were in the background.
There is no (except the short only of Judy), have no role itself, sing all together and not more strongly that music, so the music not only Acompana their songs.
Also on the scene is located in the fund.
What intentionally?
B. Zs: are basically simply because of technical problems.
On the other hand deliberately did not want to distribute papers.
The song also deals with this, on a while that we forget our egos, which who where it has been and where it is going, those wings, the wings of love us lifted.
It wanted to achieve that others felt that state of mind that we feel when we came into this song.
Hvg. Hu: to what Dedicaste more work?
Zs. B.: in the composition music actually no, rather when it comes to mix up there were pieces more difficult.
For example the Dorian Gray's in that I am playing in a piano in concert or the Rock'n'roll to the girls, where for a long time I did not want to operate the groove and then, little by little all got down to its place as in a puzzle.
Hvg. Hu: what is your favourite song on the new disc?
Zs. B.: this is changing all the time with concerts and "because I have already unleashed" the disc.
Now the Prophet is to fool, the escape from the earth and the same.
A deceptive row stock exchange risks billions from their inferiority complex
an unfair Malversador.
This is how points out to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the giant banker French Générale, also owner of the Bank of Czech trade.
For him lost almost five billion euros.
However, it seems rather than Kerviel was a great player who wanted to be compared to his colleagues and, of course, with good skills.
Intuyó some time, unlike all the big banks Czechs, the crisis in the market for mortgages American.
"Is fragile" was left to hear of his superiors, the same people who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from the answers of Kerviel according to what the media, such as the French newspaper Le Monde, is that this was a man who at the end of last year had a gain of more than EUR 1.6 billion thanks to their businesses.
Crisis not only in America
"Everything that I wanted to do was to make money for my bank" assures in his answers.
In fact, in the summer, managed to win during the crisis, American 500 million.
This opportunity was already come at the beginning of the year.
In February began to hear some news on the so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had difficulty with the payments and that these customers would begin to have problems.
However, this crisis should not influence throughout the economy.
Kerviel not believed and opted correctly.
And then, at the end of the year their earnings exceeded the EUR 1.6 billion.
"When already earned my first 500 million not as I knew notify" admits Kerviel, and adds that nothing has been left to himself, not at all.
Throughout the interrogation declared that it had distorted the records in such a way that it was not just their discovery.
Even came to mislead the heads, even if the stock market Eurex began to take an interest in their business.
The risk became benefit
What feared that were to discover?
Rather, do not.
"I thought that had won 1.6 million for the Bank and that from this simple fact, that I would be happy."
Where are brought so much willpower to risk in this way?
In my opinion should work gradually.
Came to work in Générale in the year 2000, just after conclusion to study in Lyon.
His salary annual between 51 dollars.
Two years after it was Assistant row stock exchange and in 2005 became row stock exchange with an annual salary of 90 000 dollars.
Yet never knew that I was going to earn as much as others.
"In my first interview in 2005 already noticed that I looked with caution.
Because of my training and also my progress professional and personal "described Kerviel researchers.
But in the short time at my entry into the company came first great success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz won, over the bomb attacks in London, playing down a title of EUR 500 million.
And this was a mechanism start, and wanted more.
If they want, you are leaving
"This is like a snowball" said the police.
But it is said that the Heads knew all this or that quite the suspected.
"While earned money, closed our eyes."
But then came the coup earlier this year.
In a day lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in the middle of January wanted to erase all trace.
When Monday came to work, no longer worked at the Bank.
And two Dias later, the Bank announced that he had lost EUR 5 billion on his fault.
And how managed to locate him?
became suspect from their holidays.
"I chose only four Dias for the past year.
Row that has no holiday is a corridor that nobody does not want to take a look at its dossier "ended Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the chance of getting 365 billion
The Ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine of the operational programmes that the Czech Republic can achieve 14 billion euros (roughly 365 billion Crowns).
This is half of the total sum that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Seven of operational programmes will be approximately 125 billion Crowns for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion Crowns the programme of enterprise and innovation.
Most of the money will go to the transport, up to 150 billion.
The programme of transport is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22% of the resources that the Czech Republic can achieve the Fund.
This money is increasing the budget of the State fund for transport infrastructure that next year will have the amount of 90.800 million kroner.
The programme of enterprise and innovation should serve to entrepreneurs and companies to obtain resources in innovation of business.
Companies should get funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of organisational methods more effective.
With regard to the use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the Recien that less use them.
Death 20 years for the former of Nicaragua, declared the Court
The Court of Appeals of Nicaragua declared on Thursday 20 years to the death of the former, German, who was sentenced in 2003 by the of $100 billion (almost 1.8 million kroner).
Despite this, a time following, was released from prison to house arrest in its finance not far from the Nicaraguan Metrópili.
It is far from clear at this time, according to the Agency PA that, the then head of state between Central American and 2002, is back behind bars.
According to the President of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Perez, will depend rather agents prison if left to complete its German punishment at home or if they do return to prison.
Four years ago, the Court showed as German Traspasaba constantly money from the government to the account of a company in Pánama.
This society was fictitious and the account belonged, in reality, their families and supporters more Cercanost.
Part of this money ended in the fund that German created to finance their campaign in the elections in 2001.
We approved the budget
That is the case.
The state budget was adopted.
Why is this special budget?
It is the first produced by the government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was adopted with the support of Ssd, because what paved the Minister Sobotka and Ssd could not allow the not accept it.
Apart from various debates before the vote on the vote of confidence to the government, this time, nothing happened dramatic.
The Parliamentary Assembly, in this traditional view although the most influential calmly, approved the new law.
It is a great paradox.
Each government begins and ends with each chapter and budget, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of the policy but it hides the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the means of Comunicacón and I therefore devote special attention.
The political discussions are much more interesting than the simple numbers.
The budgets of the state of the past governments of the Social Democrats suffered three defects that for this year 2008 can not be solved so easily:
The first of these is the high turnout of compulsory laws, known as expenditure of the leaders who are not only pensions but also the social benefits that were approved last year before the elections for the "silent" coalition of Ssd and Ksm.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third is the deficit limit of public funding, as the budget deficit municipal and Community.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the budget deficit of the state.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the budget deficit municipal and Community.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money of taxes, charges and appropriations banks, often issued, senseless, obligations with which disproportionately to their local authorities.
In recent years managed to pay these debts through the sale of mass actions energy and other networks of development that received from the state and privatization.
Currently do not have this resource.
If only we stick to the facts official and verified, we discover that:
Our economy, because a few years ago, is through stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, which claims Ssd.
This was the ideal opportunity to put his government to state finances.
However, instead followed the state.
The other, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, Economizaron much more reasonably that our Republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that within the global measures we are less threatened by poverty.
That is why they are not necessary programmes massive social, unfortunately, in recent years Inutilmente is Hincharon with measures huge.
And although managed to remove part of the incomprehensible expenditure populist approved this year before the elections, if soon does not change the retirement age and pension reform then really be the end of any policy in this country, and governs who governs only be a mere bureaucracy.
We can say that politicians in government officials, mechanics of most of the taxpayers' money for retirement and social benefits.
That is why, this year's budget can not be revolutionary, but can stop the pressure of expenditure normal expenditure of the leaders.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion by the year 2008 would have been totally unnecessary if the government last had not wasted in the last ten years.
I do not want politicians who govern become only officials that is why we must be patient and give this weak coalition of the government, which is aware that the state can only spend what it is capable of obtaining of taxes and duties, tranquillity for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will make the gradual achievement of a balanced budget of the state.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks British, Swiss and Canadian decided to fight together against the crisis of the market of finances.
In the marking monetary will meet more than one hundred billion dollars through Licitaciónes.
In these tenders banks auctioned interest rates by which they can lend.
For example, the American EDF sent to bid 40 billion dollars, and then other 24 billion will facilitate the central banks of Europe and Swiss.
After the attacks of 11 September, this is the first time that central banks of different States agree on this process coordinated to protect and reduce the impact of the crisis of finance.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the Contínuo growth of the lack of free capital that banks could provide" wrote in his report to clients, Bernard Baumohl of the consultant economic outlook group.
"This coordinated action by the central banks probably fell recession in the United States of 65% to 50%" added Baumohl in his report.
The banks have already spent 60 billion dollars in unpaid appropriations, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
"The central banks must have really fear of what awaits them even when we decided to take this step," said the chief economist of ABN, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really evil," he added.
They fear that the central banks have the same problems of access to loans and that it will have to pay more for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the Economóa world.
The central banks so decided, after that were not reduce the so-called tariff Libor, tariff London used for the loan of money in the market.
This means that the banks feared constantly paid money even when the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain during the autumn reduced its interest rates several times.
"It will have the same effect as a further fall in interest rates" told the Reuters news agency, Greg Salvaggio of the company Tempus consulting.
Some economists is not that the step taken by the central banks contribute to light the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem is that the fall of the property market in the US.
Klaus: the debates of environmentalists are incredible
The change global climate particularly affects the developing.
The President Vaclav Klaus expressed again with regard to the problem of global warming.
The criticism came now with the closure of the UN International Conference on climate change, in Bali.
In Vienna, where presented his book Azúl, not planet Green, said that the discussions of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mixture of representatives of government and non-governmental organisations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric and reality is used.
"There debates hardly are structured, are fireworks of substitutes words, the solution to the current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important for him, and that consequently takes an interest.
Also expressed their joy at discovering his book translated into German because as often said "I am only with a caricature of my ideas."
Now the stakeholders can obtain information on their varied views.
Klaus reminded that it is not a Climatólogo but that is, in his opinion, sufficient assumptions as to write a book like this.
Is academic, with the capacity to follow and judge a specialist, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the time of the closure expressed his thought that the climate is changing all the time and its changes are normal that global warming there is no agreement between scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not very great, serious, nor are potential disasters and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and Costosamente unacceptable.
As well as a man experimented with the totalitarianism seen as unacceptable to impose the views not proven to others, what is dangerous as a way to limit the freedom of others.
The questions of the present explained repeatedly that are not against "reasonable defenders of the environment but against militants environmentalists that do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits."
With the same subject spoke Klaus in Vienna as long as two months in the Institute Hayek.
600 not achieved thousand people to change their driving licence
Six hundred thousand drivers are spent the date and therefore not achieved to change their old card lead the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can apply for change so that officials them time until the end of the year in issuing the new card.
However, the Ministry not concerned that after the new year on the roads are hundreds of thousands of drivers without the card valid.
According to traffic, the card have not changed mainly those who no longer want to drive.
While the people in announcing a rapid decline of the change of cards, the offices of the metropolis full of applications and the interest in the new card has increased.
The city estimated around 2 000 customers a day.
In queues is expected a half an hour.
In Prague have not yet been drawn by the new card around 140 000 drivers.
The issuing of a new card lasted twenty Dias.
However, it is possible to ask for the issuing of the card in a shorter term of five Dias.
But in that case the driver must pay 500 kroner.
Drivers who necessarily must change their card and do not achieve until the end of the year, but will be to the roads without the card applies to a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand kroner.
The police can settle the infringement with a reprimand.
If it was a breach administrative the fine will rise to EUR 2.5 kroner.
According to the information previous could receive a fine that person that it is not going nowhere.
Could presumably pay up to 30,000 Crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to enter moderately fines of thousand kroner, at the most.
According to the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, fines of thousand kroner do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driving licence is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that every person must have valid.
People who do not want to lead should hand over the card lead.
Enough to bring it or send it by post certificate to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year no longer valid the cards issued during the years 1964 and 1993.
However, drivers should gradually be changing other types of driving licence.
People with the document between the years 1994 to 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card that was issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka these are 2.6 million documents more.
The Court reduced the death to the detectives accomplices of Berdych
The Expolicias Josef Opava and Petr Koaík accused of complicity with the offender David Berdych will move between 13 and ten years in prison.
The High Court in Prague decided as expiry final reduction of penalties, the first and the second to one year, two years.
The detectives of the Departamente Praguense against organised crime I was going to fall, in principle, between 14 and 12 years.
Against the decision to no longer can be used, it is only through the reversal by the High Court.
Berdych is also accused in this case but he hopes firstly the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
Yet in other processes has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
Can not get more.

Polívka lost the Kingdom of Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the case on the mark Kingdom of Walachei.
According to the Court judge provincial Ostrava was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Walachei but the project was created for many years by Tomái Harabii with whom the actor worked.
Polívka was tabled today to the oral procedure.
According to his lawyer the cause probably not have finished his client and use.
"The case is that Mr Harabii and his team are parasites of the popularity of Bolek Polívka" said after the process, the lawyer Polívka.
For him, in the words Kingdom of Walachei, everyone comes the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea has also Harabii.
"We have been following us around ten years of work.
Search for money and invention of activities, "he said.
For him, the cause of the case is in the money.
"After years I have noticed that the project is successful and that it could also be something.
They want to live as parasites of our work, "he added.
A lucrative business
According to the Court marks the Kingdom of Walachei was first used by Polívka in their television programme.
In 1993 was crowned with the player Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not a question of into the creation of a fictitious Kingdom.
A few years later to Harabii thought publishing the passport of the Kingdom of Walachei.
From that comical origin was a business and a lucrative business activity which Harabii created after the society Kingdom of Walachei.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature in passports and even offered their holders discounts to the Vistantes of its farm and assistants to their performances.
Who sit in the throne?
The judge today also found that Harabii only used a simple idea that Polívka issued in the stage for their own benefit business.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Walachei" said the judge.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabii and his team which is devoted to this entirely.
The cooperation between the today Descompuestas parties, continued until the year 2000 when Harabii organised for Polívka the crowning official in Vsetín.
Since that time began to be conflicts between Polívka and Harabii whose culmination came with the overthrow of the "King I, the elected forever."
The lead role in the Kingdom, through Harabii led to the singer Jarmila Uláková, as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka presented an accusation against Harabii and their society that until now has been rejected by the Court.
Something in clear might bring in the dispute, the tournament for the throne with their princesses, which is already preparing Harabii.
From the new king.
Did not want to reveal even more data or dates.
"We have no rush.
It should be something like the way towards King Moravia.
The King would have to be elected by a specific date.
Even Mr Polívka can stand "added Harabii.
Test Peugeot 207 Sw 1.6 Vti: overcome prejudice
The truth is that I have never liked too the Peugeotu 206.
Their characteristics gear were never anything special, the quality of the box manoeuvre changes, and also the product could be characterised as below average.
But there is now in the market his successor, the Peugeot 207, and this is much better.
This so-called Sw is a little more advanced and to me, because I can only better.
When the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, of the area of the masthead in the back seat.
But that would be the only complaint because the bodywork of the means to this end, which I will not suffer to two metres in length.
The Bush by the World
step by the internal quickly so as not to repeat it too.
This is an elegant design where the only flaw is the poor central tunnel.
Here assessed more the invention of design although the Auto seems rather elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the days when short seats and.
Also unlike the 206 model, the management side has improved considerably.
What about space?, and here can feel how have grown measures of the bodywork.
In the disappears the shortage of space on the masthead.
Luggage to the boot
But the most important thing in this car is its boot.
This must assess it as very accessible (thanks to the Portón back) and a storage well distributed.
The dead spaces equipped with rubber posed an ideal solution.
Not bother, and they can be extended to the point of subject heavy objects.
In the deposit.
According to the tables, in basic regime has a capacity of 428 litres compared to what the competition is more of an average value.
But not in comparison with the vehicle more of the same type sold in the Czech Republic, the Koda Fabia.
If we compare the 207 Sw with the new generation of the model of Mladá Boleslav, that the Peugeot falls behind with their perceptible 52 litres.
On holiday abroad or in placing the value of the child is critical.
But if I had to say something positive then I have to give you the floor that it is quite level after the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our car was equipped with a Encedido injection of four valves on a capacity of 1.6 l. And a force of 88 Kw.
To tell the truth and that is how it should seem like a 1600 that Menospreciara to the family five doors.
It is silent, consumes little and above all, it must momentum.
If I compare this with the era of Ikoda at the time that it seemed as if the exhaust pipe was Taponado by a rag with it, I can say that I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for everyone.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have a vehicle equipped gracefully and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with lighting of injection of 1400 by 329.900 kroner, there is room.
Our aggregates make from 410.900 kroner, which is already too much.
The kind premium already reached other 80,000 kroner.
Only that Tendriamos still in the airbag, automatic air conditioning, automatic, windows automated ...
In other words, the car with all of all, it costs 531.900 kroner.
It is much, but given the supplements of the team in the Fabia and come to a number quite similar.
Now it only remains to decide which of the two brands.
Students Slovaks not integrate into English schools
English in schools attended by children of Eastern Europe and that is why the local people more afraid of changes in schools.
The integration of East Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even the British schools have those cases where conflicts between immigrants and the children of the natives increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of the children of Eastern Europe in the British schools is all very well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where are beginning to grow conflicts between the natives and migrants Slovaks.
Discussions, Estorsión and Broncas between students have already reached even their own parents.
Things have come so far that the police arrested Chatmam Slovak a woman who was hitting sticks to a student of ten years with a yardstick Green.
In his defence said that the girl was her child with insults tone racist.
The police had to act after an attack by two girls under the age of 18 against a migrant Slovak.
Girls Agasajaron him with racist insults and throwing stones.
"When we were going home, a boy approached towards us to the bus and started biting us.
When I told him that what made us stop the attempt to launch us apples and pears, and then fell trousers and we showed its back "described another unpleasant incident to the times, the mother of the student Slovak.
The complaints are on both sides.
One of the native even appointed to the conflict with the migrants from Eastern Europe and fight for survival.
The cases already mentioned earlier, show us as the atmosphere in schools English is beginning to be fairly tense.
In Britain there are registered 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work.
Approximately 30 000 students Slovaks attend school English.
Cuba, the island more beautiful Caribbean
For Vistantes is really the island of freedom.
Anything that expect their holidays can be met, provided that Eliga correctly.
Sandy beaches and gold, large waves or a sea calm as a pond.
The palm trees and the all including waiters offering pizzas on the beach, or varied.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea can find all this and much more.
Only on an island is still much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it, the most beautiful that human eye has seen.
Havana became warehouse and port cargo of treasures that the Spanish of America and led to Europe.
And then came the time American.
The hotel national grew at the end of the 20 years.
What sent build one of the heads of the Mafia American, Lucky Luciano, because everything that needs to be of crime in the US (and therefore prohibited) was welcome and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among its guests were, among others
Winston Churchill, Ava, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana arose buildings, high by floods at cars that were a symbol of worship in the 1950s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway are bought a finance in San Francisco of Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar was yacht.
In the walls of the Bodeguita of the half left their signatures the stars of the world of the show, and politicians throughout America.
And today?
In the walls of the Bodeguita Habanense you can make it your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive hotel national him mix the cocktail according to their wishes.
And these cars already of worship of the 1950s, so far still in operation by Havana because those Lada and Fiat reached a long time ago have been between these wet and salty winds.
Even if Havana, especially the old neighborhood is going to deteriorate significantly, does not exist in the vicinity so many wonderful monuments colonial as there.
Elsewhere Metamorfosean in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money necessary, its development this guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years grew new hotels not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and as a bogeyman, Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curious that is unique in the world and it is very valued by lovers of the railways.
Sugar cane is transported from the vast plantations until sugar factories by Vias close in machines steam or electricity.
Their garages for dozens of years were discovered and are there now, machines that work and whose models brothers in other parts of the world are only in museums.
Where to go?
The place better known for most Vistantes does not change.
And that is why it is not necessary to speak more of Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, only to point out that in the aforementioned finance Hemingway there is a museum that for those who are lovers writer, must not fail to visit it.
The valley Viñales is the most scenic corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation growing on land of rock.
Mogotes, Pilones of rock and rocks of high Escarpados in the Caidas of the valley, and in their Grutas is Aclimatan fertile land which are formed Roquedales that swept dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where it is grown, probably, higher quality tobacco in Cuba.
Visiting some of the factories Habaneras of cigars can be found with his final product.
Perhaps someone seems interesting that there is the Chilean part of the series, the more monstrous.
Trinidad
city of old pedigree that was founded not long after the Spanish Colonizaran the island.
Slavery and the sugar brought fame and wealth.
The wealth became beauty with constructions in the small town.
The architecture colonial Spanish, especially influenced by the settlers French arrived later, in four centuries little has changed.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra of Escambray, is a place so (still in the 1950s of the last century there was that the road to join with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped the stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built, either, and so nothing was destroyed, for every person was happy to be where to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad that a single afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in the immediate vicinity as the beach in Ancón or the valley of the sugar factories.
The night belongs to the House of music, which encourages with its music the silence of the morning.
Baracoa
small town in the Far West of Cuba, some consider it as the most beautiful of the island.
Surely that view is confirmed by the own way.
The two roads coming back from Guantanamo must go through ups and Quebradas mountains, how for a nature that hardly knows the action of man.
This place Eastern Cuba has been included as a world heritage by UNESCO intact thanks to their nature.
There are doing the best chocolate, in his church have the Cross of Columbus (it is actually a cross that came 100 years later of the landing) and from the hill, where was the castle and that there is now a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and including the best known, the anvil.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra teacher, the Bay of Pigs and the island of pine, the cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of charity of copper, the Santería, religion African descendants of those slaves, it could fill many pages.
However, as they say, better to see it once.

Mohamed is of course the name of the Prophet Muslim, but above all a name very common in Sudan.
Then the children have done a paper to the class with the photo of the bear with the following legend "my name is Mohamed."

Repair spectacular on the space station
will have taken more than seven hours of work in the area to the astronaut Scott Parazynski and their fellow crew of the international space station (Iss) to carry out the repair spectacular of a solar panel torn apart and essential for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A way out risky that accumulated records because of its duration, of his departure from the modules livable, the speed with which was instruments, "Chapuceados" by the astronauts to make repairs.
The problem appeared on Tuesday then that the astronauts had released from the shuttle discovery the module harmony, a piece heavy Cilíndrica responsible for laboratories European scientists and Japanese (see framed).
This module is a kind of platform for landing Módulos-laboratorios.
But we must be able to provide them with electricity.

Having moved, the crew began the reorganization of the solar panels of the module which have a scale of 76 metres.
And it is where one of the panels, which are deployed as Acordeones, has been damaged in more or less than a metre by a cable that Atrancó.
The deployment has been stopped so as not to damage more the panel.
The astronauts, who had initially make a way out of control of the shuttle discovery, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to take up the panel damaged.
And is Scott Parazynski who has been elected to go to Caracolear at the end of the 30 metres of the remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to the station to carry out repairs.
It is one of the best "Spacewalker" (Andador of space) of NASA.

The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday at the end of the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of the President Poutine, United Russia.
Confirming their quest for stability, even to authoritarianism, after a campaign very limited.
Three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today the voters a message televised on public agencies, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
It does so as the leader of the list for United Russia, the Pro-Kremlin party whose victory is proving overwhelming.
Yesterday, the President left little nothing Transparentar be receiving the ambassadors foreigners, hand over a new charge against the West accused of interference - its theme of predilection during the campaign.
"We know the cost of a true democracy and we want honest elections, more transparent and more open, elections without incidents," he added.
According to the opposition, we are a long way from the truth.
Denounces a campaign tarnished by pressure.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there is no "never had elections so dirty, until at the time of Eltsin."
After the repression of demonstrations of the last weekend, the former champion of the world of check Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, are allowed to receive visits according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of homo Sovieticus"
Behind these legislative elections without surprise emerge two questions much more open:
who happen to Poutine to the Presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to know.
Elected in 2000 and elected again in 2004, Vladimir Putin can not seek the third term in a row.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will play Poutine after March?
What Prime Minister?
Does head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful United Russia party that Elegería the government and the President?
Whatever, to the legislative elections and the presidential power, outgoing triumph.
It is a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of homo Sovieticus, do not feel masters of their own destiny", estimated the sociologist Goudkov, Director of the Centre independent Levada.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov, of the State University of St. Petersburg, goes back further: civil society be delayed in this country Cristianizado five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the Community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine restored the model of a paternalistic State, fully accepted by the population as this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a true confession economic", estimated Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "they give up on their own will on the personal responsibility" of those who briefly had shown after the outbreak of the USSR.
"What reflect?"
The phenomenon affects all sections of society, including the world affairs.
And the elite administrative intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of each 85 heads of Russian regions) run the lists of the local United Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often Sinónimas of chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of the Russians will not be voting either by extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a professor of age of 54 years: "Why should they reflect?
What those in power are not too bad, why change them? "

Will there be the end of the year on the stock exchange? the experts, divided by the crisis'
Subprime'a less than five weeks to dismiss the closure of the financial year, investors already the hands in the hope that the traditional end of the year.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this is going to produce.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market is often a good behaviour.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based solely on statistics, more even because in the current context, the uncertainties lurking in the markets, at least in the short term. "
Although they are not in favour of the stock market lame Carrerilla in recent weeks of the year, these experts suggest that "the stock market is claimed by the existence of liquidity, prepared to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the bond, affected by the fact flight towards values of quality sections in both the long and short."
I therefore believe that the stock market will have a behaviour rather lateral, not exempt from volatility "especially for that is not known the likely impact of the fall in rates the Fed, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions".
Javier district, responsible for sales in Spain, is in line with that it is not a good time to venture to say that there is going to be.
"Is not the thing for many joys," provides the expert.
The ibex has lost nearly 4% since the maximum set on 8 November when the index closed in the 15.945,7 points.
Yet not all the experts have this vision so negative.
John Solana, analyst of Intermoney, believes that the ibex 35 could end the year closer to the 16 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and to the traditional contributions to the pension plans that take place every year at this time.
However, the expert clarifies that things will be something different this year because it believes that the rally was the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not believe that the volatility will affect the trend of the market.
For its part, Olucha, analyst of Inversis Bank, values that we are close to technical standards and "Therefore we could see a rebound in the index that could be driven depending on the news reaching us with regard to the consequences of the crisis in the credit market."
The analyst is confident that they are positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for the ibex towards new peak levels.
Solana, Intermoney, says that "this year it is the turn of the great values."
The expert included in the portfolio to the two big banks and some construction "because when it comes to the date, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
Meanwhile, Olucha, of Inversis Bank ensures that the increases will come from the hand of banking and of the industrial sector.
The construction will also be able to benefit from this, should be given.
"ACS brings several months recovering positions and we hope that other construction as Ferrovial and FCC follow the same path", explains the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be a major player in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the season of Christmas sales.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technological also will very well although in this case there is a lot of representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven year
Over the last seven years, only two occasions December has been a month.
The real end of the year we lived in 2003, exercise in which the stock markets out of the crisis triggered by the puncture of the technological bubble.
This year, in which the ibex 35 recovered a 28,17%, December showed a rise of the 6,68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (by the time the ibex up a 8,36% since January) and if we can count on your end of the year.

The results of the experience of people will be crucial to other entities point or no to this initiative which backs hours of the shops.
This is precisely the aim popular with the project.
To catch the individual customers by moving these areas to make their purchases, SMEs, self-employed and trades of the streets elected to open up.
The Bank is to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, since they are not new openings but remodelling of the existing ones.
To this end, the entity which already has branches in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile submit the customers of different streets.
In this way, the extension of working hours is accompanied by a different conception of the area of the branch and a new design, more current, with more colours lights.
Responsible for banking trade, angel, ensures that this restructuring is not a great investment, although if more staff recruitment, as we move to have six employed by local to eight or nine.
The offices, which have even with spaces so that SMEs can meet there, sell products not financial.
A positive experience for the Group
people already has its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, according to explain Angel Rivero.

According to Vasile, the comparison with antenna 3 is due to the fact that' we are talking about two similar companies.
The fact is on how much we can do, in the same market, at what cost and how to get value for money in terms of hearing'.

Vasile ensures that, although it is too early to take the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in partnership with its parent Mediaset.

This year, I hope we will be able to make it happy to our shareholders, which we have already taken value with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market at this time shows a certain tiredness.
Lehman recently reduced its estimate of the benefit to 4% in 2008 and 2009, 7%.
It must explain, which has cut the expected growth of income of 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This signing has decreased the prospect of an increase in antenna 3 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

This approach requires explain why the action, or inaction, of his government have contributed significantly to Spain lead the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance, in which sectors has taken place and why his government, that of the contract with the planet, it has not avoided.
In addition, required to explain this quite clear to the Spanish what measures it intends to take to slow down climate change.

Sure what I should be?
motor insurance, which covers the driver to possible claims, is a major expenditure that will depend on various factors such as age, sex, age of the card, the marital status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the use of, among others.
Take the car is only the beginning.
And that is that, choose appropriate motor insurance is even more difficult to choose the model of vehicle.
First of all we must be clear what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This compromise takes the form of a contract of insurance, which states that the company will receive the value of the premium agreed in exchange for responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is set out in view of various factors such as age, sex, age of the card, the marital status, the type of vehicle to assure him or the use of, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that most likely to have an accident, the greater share to pay.
It is for that reason that both the age of 25 and women have to pay premiums lower, as the statistics show that have a lower rate of accidents due to their care.
Also, lists, companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than drivers singles.
The use of it to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus in the likelihood of having some sort of.
By increasing the frequency increase the odds.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the price of the premium.
It is for this reason that the driver must take a good look at the situation to choose the best suited to its profile.
Here the most significant variables to choose one or other types of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapt to the characteristics of the insured, offered a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 are with various disadvantages in hiring insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced experience in driving and the age of the card.
Although the ideal to be well assured is any risk insurance, there are other options economic.
More cautious drivers may choose to a risk with franchise, so get the coverage of insurance to any risk but at a price that is more feasible.
Such a Convention would mean that customers pay a part of the amount of the disaster.
"The part of the amount of the sinister that brings the customer is Preestablecerá depending on the value of the premium, which will be the higher the lower the amount", specifies Luis Noguera, maximum responsible in Spain of Europe, first mediator insurance online.
Another option is a safe third expanded, so that the customer ensuring protection against damage caused to third parties, although not the first caused in their own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
A Council.
If you are under the age of 25 years trying to be careful and avoid accidents as far as possible, as this will have an impact on the bonus, and could reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the tariff basis with the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge tariff on that basis.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and profit.
If the company has had a good year can afford to increase subsidies ", clarifies Noguera.
The Gaza last 25 years drivers are easier to take out insurance, since the rate of accidents is reduced as a result of the experience gained.
For this reason, the most desirable is to take any risk with franchise.
"Normally young people can not make use of the experience already gained in use in an accident, and even in the driving," assures the head in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once it is now the' fear of the novice'.
However, if the customer is married but does not yet have children is preferable to negotiate any risk insurance, as long as its economic situation permitting, of course.
For its part, marriages with children are viewed by insurers as the public with lowest rate of accidents, so that the surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best would be one sure to any risk with franchise (which can be 300 Euros), or, when they have a high level of bonus, one third extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"Conducting a driving more relaxed and have the greatest purchasing power to afford to take a number of franchise more", ruling Luis Noguera.
For retired people is commendable insurance to any risk with franchise (and this of EUR 150), or one third extended when it has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that motor insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver to possible claims, but also because it represents an important expenditure, which is why it is essential to study properly insurance that more suits us in our personal situation.

Climate of Venus can give an idea of the future of the earth
Venus may have been once an appropriate place for life, scientists said yesterday.
The data of a European space ship in orbit showed the planet more like a twin of the land of what had been noticed previously.
Venus is the planet closest to the earth.
The two planets have similar size and occupy orbits similar, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made the earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, the erosion by air solar radiation and solar rotation slower Venus sent a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the temperature of the surface is enough to melt lead and it is being eroded by the storms of rays.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus, who has studied the planet for one year, provides a picture of how the earth could develop changes catastrophic because of the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the department of physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the mission Venus, declared: "It is clear why the climate in Venus is so different from the earth, when they are two planets so similar.
"Our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which Venus began as land, possibly with a habitable environment makes millions of years."
Police caught "enriched uranium"
a kilo of radioactive material, who say is enriched uranium, was yesterday Slovak police and Hungarian.
A Portavos police declared that three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The effective could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said that it could have been sold for $1 million (GBP).
Still remains open
Mitt Romney says that is not worthy that presidential candidates answer the questions of a monkey of snow.
However, the Republican candidate for the Presidency possibly agree to hold a debate in Youtube, in which ordinary voters questions on video and sent to its spread between the candidates.
None of the questions tabled in the afternoon of Wednesday 28 November were more ridiculous than that of the monkey snow that Democrats asked about global warming in the debate of the Republican Party of Youtube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot about the state of the Republican Party for the elections next year.
We do not know exactly how the producers of CNN, which Co-patrocinan the debate, chose the videos of Youtube to show the candidates for candidates.
But the first half an hour of debate, the longer devoted to a single issue, focusing on immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful clichés for the Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters that dial when listen ideas that I Agradaran: issuers peaks of approval when the candidates spoke with arguments extremists.
Exchanges of words strongest of the evening occurred between Rudy Giuliani, the pioneer national, and Mr Romney, which has been leading in the crucial polls Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani is trying to ruin the reputation of Romney because it was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
Mr attacked Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts employ illegal immigrants to work at home.
Both responded aggressively when I asked whether any candidate could support a "Amnesty" (allowing illegal immigrants to regularize their situation and giving them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
The candidates minors as Duncan hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman of Colorado, succeeded in accordance with the issue.
None has the floor of being nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because both alerted on the issue of immigration earlier than others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, the candidates share views: increased vigilance on the borders, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This cliché, together with the fear of toys toxic China and other concerns about the foreign aid, to the Republicans to forget, or minimise, divisions between Liberals and Conservatives Christians.
But the debate was transformed into uncomfortable when other issues.
To Mr Guiliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed as to whether the immersion in water should be considered a torture.
Someone asked whether the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led to Mr Giuliani to encounter towards the position that while the Bible was his book favorite, did not believe literally in the history of the Jonás and the whale.
Someone else asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first of all in the most recent poll, thanks to his conservatism Christian longstanding - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed to answer if Jesus would be in favour, the laughed by saying that Jesus was too intelligent to be a candidate in the elections.
The race continues unusually open.
Mr Huckabee increases in Iowa, coincidentally with fundraising campaigns of the liberal rum Paul, and their statements by the heated debate on Wednesday.
These two have come from the back, because both sides of the party not reached agreement on the candidate most famous and traditional.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincing winner with a message on the greatness of America, satisfying to both wings of the Party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in that sink; but also emerging
As the political scandals still in England, this is not particularly interesting.
Not appear to have sold influences, nor is Exhorbitantes Auditors hotel in Paris, or Chupadas of fingers.
But it has been revealed that a rich businessman has disguised contributions to the party of government, of more than 650 pounds (1.3 million dollars), for almost four years using false names, and that the party not denounced.
Two months ago, when Prime Minister avoided call an election, insult the British intelligence stating that opinion polls not in its decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong government and efficient.
But instead, as Vince Calbe, the Liberal Democrat leads with ingenuity growing, because the dreaded Mr Brown has gone from being Stalin to be Mr bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in problems, showed the weakness regulatory and poverty trial in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code has made the business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authorities lost 25 million of personal data that revealed shoddy work administrative unimaginable.
A trio of retired general launched a mutiny in the House of Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: be Ministers of the armed forces, is called for, a part-time employment.
It is now up to the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watts, the Secretary-General labour (and previous complicit) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr Brown walk irrevocably towards the end.
Governments can reach a turning point after which they may be unable to govern.
People do not think as politicians, but usually suspended their disbelief when a new batch assumes control.
Once it is clear that the Prime Minister can not improve things, that it has no remains for a long time, this suspension is worth: public officials are beginning to fail; the cabinet ministers are set out; the press seeks bad news; and the government is on the defensive and not focus.
On the one hand, the position of Brown is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders can not defend themselves on the grounds that it is new.
Even if I wanted to renege on Tony Blair, was his lieutenant higher.
The problems of the Northern Rock and tax registration of authority, are related to the decisions made Brown as Chancellor of the purse.
And even when it is not directly involved in the setbacks of Blairish - or "effective partners," the research funding of political parties - voters can assume that if it has.
Mr Brown, however, the situation is not as bad as it seems.
The gaffes are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As Mr bean, no one is dead, or has been cheated directly.
And the remedy, although painful, is to give what trends of course Stalinists of Mr Brown have promised always: a reliable government and brutal.
The new political scandal of donation is a good example.
Mr Abrahams, comparing their donations with gifts of charity, says that he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision not to take him.
Laws against anonymity for large taxpayers politicians is clear and there is a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those in power.
Mr Watts, who said to know of the agreement by Mr Abraham, and that this was not illegal, obviously face Mendlesohn, head of fundraising to which asked on donations in October.
But Mr Brown has so far not is involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these activities, although the bulk of the payments was made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
Has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but is diluted in the decision-making process on a matter of family, a Commission of Inquiry into the matter - driven largely by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been raped, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, and to find a permanent and independent head for the committee on standards in public life, because it has not had one for six months, and in addition to push for a genuine reform of the financing of parties.
This will require a cooperative hard work of labour with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation is with the trade unions - bitter measures for partisan as Mr Brown.
But he has to deal with a few facts Party.
The Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way they can move to the victory is to act with an impeccable probity and a strong competition.
Sharks cards
The crisis of subprime mortgages is infecting the American market credit cards?
When there is blood in the water, it is only natural that a few fins Dorsales Naden around.
Today that the American market is in crisis, housing predators have their eyes on the market of the country of credit cards.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that the losses in credit cards can reach 99 billion dollars if the crisis of subprime mortgages other forms of appropriations consumption.
Signs of infection already are.
There is an increase in the charges of cards as crime rate, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been cancelled or that are more than 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that has taken 1.4 million charge in its business of financing to the American consumer, partly because of the weakness of the providers of cards.
However, it is too early to panic.
Late payment and crime are at low levels.
According to's, a rating agency, the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the law American bankruptcy of people (2005) gave rise to a sharp fall in applications of bankruptcy, which in turn represent a major loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore of late payment) would be growing again, or it may be that the conditions for borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also brings solid payment rates, which show how much of its debts paid by consumers every month.
And confidence in credit cards and values backed by assets is quite strong, despite the paralysis in other areas financial.
Dennis Moroney of Towergroup, a signature research, predicts that the volume of emissions by the year 2007 will be close to 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of infection of the crisis between subprime mortgages and the market for credit cards certainly exists: consumers like to pay debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are ending.
But the issuer of the credit card look more the flow of liquidity asset values, so that prices fall in Accionan not necessarily a change in the capacity worthy of borrowers.
They can even work to outflank issuers.
The incentives so that consumers will continue to pay off the mortgage decreasing if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the debt of the card up on the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond rapidly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that the mortgage lenders changing interest rates or altering balances creditors.
This in theory should reduce the risk of a Retasación rapid asset.
"We are not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all loans," says Gary Perlin, head of finance capital one.
If a sudden infection of the subprime credit cards on the market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If prices of homes are lower and a credit crunch driving America to the recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a future stronger.
We must continue to monitor these fins Dorsales.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
three British bankers who were on trial for their responsibility in the fraud with the former head of the office of financial Enron, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven charges of fraud by Coludir with Fastow in an operation financial secret in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
Were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before the judge Ewing Werlein Jr. Of the district or. S, each was sentenced as guilty of Colución in fraud.
The three former executives Natwest, a unit of the Scottish Group in the Royal Bank, cause became famous in Britain for extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case weak marks the end of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were having alerted in 2002 to Fastow that was objective of a government research on the fall of Enron.
The accusation against bankers - Dobló the "Natwest three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his assistant higher previous, Michael Kopper.
Natwest had invested in a subsidiary to a society of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of fraud in Enron, who helped spiral of its descent into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the Bank interests of the subsidiary at zero, but the three British knew that rising.
A company under the control of Kopper bought the interest of the Bank of subsidiary in $1 million dollars.
The bankers paid to Kopper 250 000 dollars for interests in that company.
According to the indictment, Fastow was Enron falsely, because the energy company would pay $20 million to Natwest for their parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million were in the hands of the British bankers, and others.
Bankers gained 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received around 2.3 million, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastow was sentenced to blame for two charges of conspiracy in the collapse of Enron.
The trio of British was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a sentence of six years in prison federal Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of 3 years and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million to live in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies in the nation, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide debt of millions or do seem successful their businesses that fail.
The collapse did lose thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth lay and former chief executive, Jeffrey were responsible prisoners the past years for their roles in the collapse of the company.
Is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
The conviction of lay for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when died of a heart attack last year.

Mr Firer was responsible for the cockpit of Gulfstream last Friday in the fair the millionaire, a four-day orgy of consumption held a centre of events in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury providers had installed their stands on display, hoping to attract new Russians wealthy towards all kinds of products, from yachts Artesonados in until the car embedded in diamonds, worth 50 cents.

"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Aprovisionada fuel for the rise of oil, the Russian capital is like Dallas when he was at peak.
"We live in 1890, when some Americans affluent came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialist," says Marshall Goldman, Professor senior Davis of the Centre for studies Russians and Eurasiáticos at Harvard University.
"As the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the largest consumers and Gastadores in the world".
Marks luxury more exclusive of the world are looking for their share of the cake.
Elsewhere in Moscow, this week there will be a conference on the industry luxury with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the President of Lvmh, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The Conference is organised by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)

In addition, the rich of second degree include 103.000 millionaires Russians whose money goes to the $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of the personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists of the Centre for economic and financial research, a think thank local.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, a 15.8% of the Russians were below the level of subsistence.)
"There are hundreds of billions in Moscow - and that is why we are all here," says Nicole Marais, representative of sales and marketing of David Morris, the jeweller London.
She has attended the fair for the first time alongside the distributor Russian trade mark, the group Soho Jewelry.
"Women are prepared and men are very much."
Visiting the fair on Sunday evening, dressed in clothes of late, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and themselves as millionaires.
"Looked cars and I am trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and Porsche," said Yumatova, which reeled off the clothes of design that used as a network carpet veteran dishing with Joan rivers.
The fair aims to attract new rich, the kind of buyers that they would be prepared to stay several hours in a warehouse that mixed marks from Cadillac Escalades, of of Mövenpick, tables for swimming pools to task, apartment in Dubai and bears of Gund.
The general public can buy fares of EUR 30 ($44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are keen to learn what mark is the most expensive and the best," said Mr Gijrath, which sat Patrióticamente in one of the real Dutch Delft, in front of a reconstruction size Mural of a paint, made of tiles painted by hand.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in Bling-bling."
In fact, sellers said that the Russians rich more record (10 to 15 years, for the Estandares Russians) have changed their tastes from the marks editions limited, not in a fair trade.
However, several thousand people: millionaires in cash, envoys of the millionaires or tourists, fill the corridors every day.

"The millionaire Russian wants wheels leather of sand or a portrait of his wife fact buckets of Zirconio, will not necessarily lead on these wheels," says Mr Karapetian.
"He will keep the car in its garage, along with other 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of their customers Russians are rich, Mr Karapetian makes it clear that the phrase "millionaire Russian" does not mean exclusivity, given the wave of prices of properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it is probably a millionaire, at least on paper if not in cash," he said.

"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," says Karryev.
Surgery "shoddy work" could be a cause of death in New Jersey
It was the day before action of thanks when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the restaurant "a bit healthier" and was how an ambulance rose by white Cape Cod, two doors down avenue in West Scott.
Suddenly, there was a car of the patrol of the police.
And then another.
"So I saw up the ambulance," said Mr Livingston, Supervisor of the restaurant that day on Wednesday.
"There was when I knew that somebody had died."
The authorities knew that the woman was dead Arroyo, of 41 years, the assistant director of the department of the police of Newark.
Now researchers are trying to determine whether it died because of a procedure carried out by a plastic surgeon unauthorised, which is not yet identified by the police, but working in the House of the 212 of the Av. West Scott.
The authorities still do not determine what caused the death of Mrs Arroyo, but waiting for the test but the results will not be available until a few weeks. This will help resolve the mysterious death that has sorry the ranks senior police Newark.
Mrs Arroyo had been the assistant director of the police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and its voice was familiar to many in the department.
"It was fair, working and persistent," says Mr McCarthy on Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"It was my guardian."

Mr McCarthy said that Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a Ex-oficial police Newark who work for the Committee on control of the alcohol, and that left two children of 14 and 11 years, and a stepchild.

The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to lift the stock market
The actions on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market hoping that the Fed Calmara conditions of credit with cuts in interest rates, which rose tranquillisers with the comments of the Vice-President of the Central Bank of the United States.
The stock markets are Aflojaron in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two in Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, declared that policymakers must be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the tension continued financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets in the midst of growing evidence of pockets of credit, Mr Kohn said that the recent turbulence "was partly reversed by the improvement in the market at the end of September and during October."
If the upward trend, would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate and business, said Kohn.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital in the markets of the US and to make further interest rate cuts, to stabilize the conditions of the credit.
The comments also helped to calm Wall Street in the midst of bad news for the economy of the US, as sales of homes that reached the record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil was marked by a warning of bear Stearns, bank of investment that 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in an overall reduction in costs to offset the loss of their investments in sub-prime mortgages in the US.
It is expected that only 20 of these posts come to London, where the Bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the average Dow Jones industrial rose in 331 points, or 2.55%, to the closure to 13.289.40, while the broad index of the S & P 500 rose a 2.65%.
In London, the index FTSE 100 rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to the closure to 6.306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of leading companies in Britain.

England takes to view the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who is to strike at the No 6 by England in Kandy this weekend, will Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should decide?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the President of the selection which is on loan - with that title particularly at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, Director of the England, it is beginning to fill offers to become dials national, and if not, in one part time.
Not achieved the sixth place of beats be unfortunate, but life often is unjust and sport as well.
It is not easy to throw what makes a man at the top of their profession, while another never goes further than the lower level, sometimes due to a lack of luck rather than by ability.
Not only in the choice is difficult because we need trials that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time to Bopara be lifted?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be done in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "tubby" Banerjee, two bright young executives with good degrees and are familiar with the business, would have to be promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who is to say what a good level for a player, unless we give it the opportunity to sink or swim to the next chance?
The figures, of course, have a great influence on decisions, but that also have opportunities.
Within a team, a player has to catch the eye of the master at the same time to take a wicket and a Bateador for opportunities to change the order if it wants to have impact as a player one day.
But to catch the eye of the Seleccionadores is more complicated.
There were many which improved last season, for example, James Anderson, played in the first test even if Stephen Harmison pleads for fit and bowls like wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 Wickets first-class in 33 careers by each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 in the same average, but both have had their moments high and can expect more of them.
The Games in Shah or Bopara in the stadium Asgiriya may be only a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make the career of a man, or it may mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, batty played in every test and did so well in the first, with 5 Wickets and 40 useful careers, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to be established at the same time who came to become a major player, and despite a note% double against Australia in Australia, can yet be underestimated.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, following a discussion more in today's sitting in the stadium Asgiriya, they will continue their instincts conservation and encourage the greater experience of Shah above the exuberance of the young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favour of Shah is a brilliant and valuable test of principles of 88 in Bombay, 32 hundreds of first-class deal with only 6 of Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent Antedecentes against spin Bowling.
But Shah did only ten careers in its two shifts in May against West Indies in the test at home, as player Middlesex, and that caused an immediate rejection of the Selectores when Vaughan called instead for the next meeting, seemed to have taken their batting something of élan that in Bombay.
On the contrary, the team Essex has in swords.
It for nothing in the field of cricket and its attitude was summarised as when turned his vehicle at an exhibition for the sponsor of the car England, Volkswagen.
Suffered minor injuries and, presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was draw its Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his fellow team that was looking to the distance, to tell you with excitement: "do that?".
Bopara is the best player, including their pass slippery to have effects on their stake that seem to satisfy it, because Batea with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choose the best time, another.
Perhaps that is the real art of the selection.
My inclination would be to give to Bopara your opportunity, this does not mean that Shah not, as suggested the leaves of tea, it is he who is playing here this weekend.
Buses to bring the refugees back to work - and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Syria Iraqi refugees began to reach Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles were not to be effective, without stretches of the visa and those who hoped that the city returned to normal.
Some even had turned to combat the militants that led out of their homes.
In the station buses of Mansour, even before the advent of 800 people from Damascus in a convoy official government made up of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan had turned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after that killed many doctors in Baghdad," says Sabah Al-qubaisi, medical Sunni.
"I returned today by what I saw in the TV and what I have read in the newspapers, on what happened in Baghdad and it is safe now."
"they say that the Mahdi Army stopped killing people", declared, referring to the militia of the Shiite militant religious cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, that he ordered his troops a cessation.
Qassim to the Atwani, Shiite 38 years and Professor in the area of Sunni Amariyah, again with his two children because it was impossible to renew their visa in Syria because the regime does not want to Iraqis working in their country.
Its neighbours Shiites in Amariyah what called on the phone and tell them that a force ally of the US helped bring Al-Qaeda outside their stronghold in the west of the capital, and to come back.
One of the newcomers of Jordan was the head of a tribe Sunni and Shiite who had been driven from their homes in Sleikh North of Baghdad, by an attack of grenades, after which urged the citizens to stand up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come here to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends I called and I was told that they had begun a militia Al-Qaeda in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my colleagues."
"That is why I have today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, of 62 years.
Many said to be attracted by the growing calm in the capital since US troops Afianzaran groups of "public concerned", armed and working in cooperation with the US military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many have returned declared by the refusal of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis were established in recent years.
Al-samarrai, 51 years and father of three children, gave voice to the common suspicion between exiles, that Nouri Al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian Government to impose restrictions on visas of refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe have fled the country because of the sectarian death.
"We were well until Al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni.
"I can not believe in a government that supports the criminals who fire my home that I left."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that the Sunnis have been expelled from the Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxing the tension.
The fear is that a sudden wave of refugees will arise again sectarian tensions and start the fight.
The small, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even conspicuous by the international orientation of its universities.
As throughout the country, the Sarlandeses lack only a field of education.
"Yesterday I explained by a time not Sarlandés that we are not Franseses" - that was the motorcycle ironic on themselves of the smallest federal state for their Cencuentenario.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a major role in the educational system of that in a study of the Institute of the German economy (Iw) called "Bildungsmonitor" took the fifth place.
In this way, the universities traditionally have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The university was in 1948 by the Franseses.
Until today students can end here his career university with two or three Dipolmas.
As a result, the of foreign students is high, 15, 6 for hundreds.
However, the number of students from the Saar is higher than the average in the universities. Many of them do not have a Bacillerato.
"It takes advantage of the system of vocational education," says Axel Plünnecke, the Experte of education sector in the Institute of the German economy (Iw).
More than five young people doing her baccalaureate in school professional. It is that is 7% points above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety the range of possibilities for education Profesional-académica is very broad.
The offer career double, in relation to the number of population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite the vocational training practice and a growing demand, the number of graduates in engineering sciences fell by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Ministry of Education of forced universities to do more publicity for the specializations in sciences engineering.
"After the first PISA study, carried out some reforms in schools of general education", says a spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
So the government introduced comparative tests throughout the country.
To ensure that children begin as soon as possible to study the last year of the project called "Kita-jahr", it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model imitate the other Estades federal.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether it has increased the performance of pupils.
According to the report Pisa 2003, the number of pupils behind in development school Desminuyó of 29 to 20%.
But, in general, not improved much as other federal states.
In Bavaria, pupils calculate know better.
For displeasure of the Sarlandeses, the report Pisa not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this area could achieve good results.
Despite the fact that the Sarlandeses are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject for study in institutions of secondary education.
Chávez change the hour.
Póximamente in Venezuela there will be another time different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chavez leaves change the timetable the country in South America the clock half an hour.
Currently Chavez is running as a comical in Spain.
As has informed the Official Journal of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, when it will be at least four hours GMT.
In this way the country South America will have a timetable that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez as an enemy of the United States, justifies its Desición saying at the time that the United States would impose an obligation on the world to change a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chavez announced the breakdown of relations with its neighbour Colombia as a result of the action with hostage taking.
The nationalist left-wing said that there would no relation either to the head of state or with the Colombian Government until the conservative Alvaro Uribe remain the President of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chavez, who is Propulsando a constitutional reform of the country where citizens oil must decide on Sunday in a Referendúm.
With this reform is quite could extend their power in the country.
The reason for the conflict was the Desición taken by Uribe by withdrawing the mandate of Chavez in negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas in that it was the release of the hostages.
On Sunday, Chavez said criticism that the decision taken by Uribe offended Venezuela.
In Spain there is much talk about Chávez.
A new tone of so-called cause feeling in the country: "Why do not you Callas?" is the phrase that have already unloaded half a million people.
This sentence pronounced the King of Spain who was annoyed by the continuing Interrupcciones by left-wing populists in the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the reduction in wages real threat to the Germans.
According to a prediction this year, a reduction in wages real threat to employees German despite a strong economy.
The experts have a host of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to the calculations of the Foundation Hans Böckler, employees Germans should have in 2007 with a real Cuenta-salario lower than the previous year.
"That is to blame for the weak evolution of salaries, the increase in the value added tax and the Estirón of food prices and energy", reported the newspaper "Bildt" Gustav Horn of the Institute of macroeconomics and research of economic cycles.
Also new burdens of the unemployment insurance to be for employees.
The Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that, given the current situation, the intention to reduce the burden of unemployment insurance a 3.3% from one year to the next, it is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the office of work should not be getting involved again in an unpleasant situation, asking appropriations and subsidies to the federal state, in the words of a political party of the German Social Democrat.
Tuesday was made public that the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the food sector and the sector of oil derivatives reached the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices with last year, these are increasing 3%.
Venus: twin brother of the earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the planet more like the earth, which so far had not been raised. The European probe "Venus" discovered rays in the atmosphere and Remolinos in the Poles, the same people who are also in winter on earth.
For the past three decades, the researchers had the suspicion that there may be rays in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence, discovered electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. In the rays Venus Cayen of heights of 54 kilometres of a cloud and behind another, account Russell of the University of California at Los Angeles to the scientific journal "nature."
According to the famous model of the origin of life of Urey-miller, the rays caused life on earth: the storms could have led to reactions in the ocean, for its part, had led to the amino acids that are the building blocks of life.
In Venus is not the case: if one day there were living there, it would have to be in one of the first states of development ", explains be Solomon of the Carnegie institution of Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus life: there can be no pressure air is almost 100 times greater than on earth and the surface temperatures reign of 500° C, in such a way that can be achieved temperatures below zero.
"Possibly, Venus is a twin" diabolical "of the land, but it is still a twin," said Russell.
The main objective of the mission "Venus" is to respond to the question as to why Venus, so similar to the land for its size, and has had a development so different.
Since the 1990s as there was no specific missions, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-express" in November 2005 was a very important step for research of Venus.
Recent research results which will be presented in many articles of "nature", according to researchers, underscore not only the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"This Desmuestra also that planets neighbours have more common characteristics to the land from which assumed," informs the ESA.
Despite the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers found in the region polar South also a Vórtice made up of the clouds that revolves faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of the flow of wind at a high layers atmospheric land of the Poles, according to a team of researchers described by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of special and physical space.
The second planet of the solar system has the mass almost equal to that land and with its Equatorial diameter of 12 000 kilometres is almost as big.
This planet also known as star Alba or star evening orbit around the sun almost 225 days.
But its period of rotation is slower: a day when Venus is equivalent to 243 days on earth.
Although Venus with their surface temperatures 460 degrees and with its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars not resembles much to the land, scientists assume that both planets were formed under the same conditions.
In the two planets had been patchwork water on earth stayed in the oceans, but in Venus in the universe.
While in the earth carbon dioxide had become stones carbon, in Venus form the majority of the atmosphere.
He defended the rally of Merkel with Dalai Lama.
, the Federal President, insists on an end to the fight between the parties for the reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellor.
He criticised indirectly to the party Social Democrat German Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst, the Federal President, is concerned about the reputation of Germany and therefore demanded that the grand coalition ended this fight for the reception of Dalai Lama.

Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in Meteria of foreign policy, it stresses the Federal President, defending Merkel by the criticism he received to carry out a new policy with China.
"The Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional way of the One China policy.
China also knows, "he said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the foreign minister (Social Democrat Party), had indirectly shown its displeasure by the reception of Dalai Lama and because of this he was attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its policy ineffective in the external field.
The reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellor was a lot of misunderstandings in relations Chino-alemanas.
Thus, the Chinese Government not only withdrew the invitation to peer Steinbrueck (Social Democrat Party), the Finance Minister of Germany, but also, according to information sources of the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, head of the Chinese Government, called on the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognise this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Stating the position of China, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept that European politicians were given to the religious leader of the Tibetans in its official position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that is trying to divide Tibet and other Tibetan region of China, which now includes also other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots such as those in France.
Battles with the police in the streets, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that there will be disturbances as was the case of France.
The Federal Minister means that we must do everything possible so that the social dissatisfaction in Germany will not be moved to the streets.
Barricades were made, the vandals fired guns with the police: after serious riots by young people in France, the Federal Minister of Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We have to look also that the social problems of our country do not take the form violent."
"We need to take seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hanover.
Not all young people in constant change of social reality.
The federal state, the state federal and local authorities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, said Schaeuble.
This relates not only to the integration of immigrants.
"Of the Summit of integration to the Conference of Islam: all this is beginning to bear fruit."
It is still early to take for granted the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the suburbs Germans do not have the same problems Edificatorios and sociological as is the case in France.
The young serious unrest in the streets with the police to the north of Paris last night.
In Tolouse also burned cars and public buildings.
Kenan Kolat, the President of the Turkish community in Germany called for greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of a copier.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, the actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the rate of unemployment among young people under the age of 25 years is above average.
We must ensure that there will be more posts of vocational training.
Kolat stresses: "We must give the young people."
The President of the Turkish community in Germany added that more than in France "there is a strong social control in families", higher than the country French.
In addition, most young people of foreign origin does not want to destroy what they had built here their parents.
Kolat view: "All in all, we have to be careful."
"We must provide the opportunity for young people to receive faster a job or vocational training."
Meanwhile night in the Paris suburb Villiers-le-bel went peacefully.
Hundreds of police officers took part in the action, a helicopter with lights territory.
Authorities reported three arrests, as well as of rubbish and cars burned.
Since the day before a team of nearly 1,000 police is looking for security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Interior Minister, announced that the police will take stringent measures until it is necessary.
The night of Monday to Tuesday around 80 policemen were wounded by unrest in Villiers-le-bel.
The riots continued the next night in Tolouse.
The disturbance began by a traffic accident on Sunday, which killed two young people.
According to information provided by the public prosecutor's office, the death of young people was not the fault of the police.
In the Kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The action very far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content came to its last point and that we should not expect anything more of it.
But in which country the Chancellor?
After his desperate action, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House must be said: it does not live in the country that would have to be governed by it.
With regard to the reproach made by repeatedly actions in foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected it with a sentence.
He said that this would be a way that showed note that did not want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower House spoke very clearly expresses all that this criticism was appropriate.
We could not feel or a minimum interest, nor any kind of feeling for the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke was presented in this way: a policy very high fleeing in foreign policy and stay there without achieve anything in particular.
One example: the prevention of climate change: a great deal praised itself for the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but says nothing about how they should be here these goals in issues of climate.
In general, this way of praise itself for two years - the leader of the Party of the Union Demócratocristiana it has not been possible to allow so much modesty.
Because insists on expressions to seek a boost to the people.
And in this way damaged its public image for the pragmatic concept with which solve the problems without going about the bush.
But in the Kingdom of Angela Wolke internal problems are Aparencias of little value.
Does the child poverty and the concerns for workers with low salaries?
The only is dedicated to speak on this subject using prayers subordinate.
It is impressive how often is wrong to speak when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a sentence more or less good.
It is beginning to encounter "as if it had been in a land unknown", in the case of more concrete information.
The section attacks.
The two favourite, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, made a confrontation in a heated debate of presidential Republicans of Youtube and must now fear only to a candidate from the outside.
From the outset already be felt tensions between the candidates.
Mitt Romney his opponent Rudy Giuliani that this would have turned to New York in "a place of refuge for illegal immigrants."
This, for its part, responded with accusations serious: "I would like to say that its own House was a" Port "for illegal." Giuliani replied to the Ex-governador of Massachustes by saying that he was who used to illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attacks: so far as the group of Republicans has no clear favorite, the eight presidential exploit the debate on CNN, especially to discredit his adversaries.
Small videos of 30 seconds, road by Usarios of the Internet that were sent to Youtube, do not have much content.
"With this way of isolation leave it to Hitler coming to power," that was the criticism of John McCain to his adversary rum Paul, the only one of the meeting that insisted on immediately withdraw troops from Iraq.
Romney receives too much criticism by the veterans of the war in Vietnam, when it refuses to recognise as torture "waterboarding," a method of interrogation, to make a person drowning simulate his death.
The reactions of the public in the Chamber in St. In Florida show that in the meantime the most important issues of the campaign are others, not only the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always welcomed very strong when praised the values Conservativos and refused the rise of taxes.
So you can see better where the weaknesses of both favourite.
"At that time I got it wrong", explains Romney and calls for forgiveness to the people and the public television for having been a defender of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, I did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf governs without uniform.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani President was swearing as President.
As well have just eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took Juramiento for a second term of 5 years.
Television Pakistani transmitted in direct the ceremony in the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf respect the Constitution and work for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday transferred its mandate of army chief to his Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, particularly by the US.
Eight years after he seized power in a bloodless military coup, the ex-general governs for the first time the state as chief civil.
With its renunciation of the post of head of the armed forces, Musharraf fulfilled the condition of the main opposition and the West.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the public prosecutor of the state, after the Juramiento Musharraf will cancel the state of emergency very soon and will meet the second condition of the West.
Since it was proclaimed a state of emergency in the Supreme Court there were many lawyers supporters of Musharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country rejected all the resources before the controversial new head of government elections on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a convoy of the military in the region Watiristán North, five soldiers were killed and another four were injured.
According to information from the spokesman of the army a bomb exploded in one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
Once again the founders of Krautrock.
The German band most famous of the 1970 continues its activity: three members of "Harmonia" took part in a concert in Berlin.
As Reestreno was a copy of "live 1974" which was written in the best time of the gang.
Already at that time were very famous in foreign countries.
The assistance of these three gentlemen to a meal official caused the feeling.
Each of them has it in front of his Cajita, their cables and on all their buttons.
In the middle sits Moebius that has 63 years and is dressed with a white shirt.
To the left is Michael Rother of 57 years, which is portable computer and Guitarra.
, looking to the right of the audience, is Hans-joachim Rodelius, 73 years of age, which is very busy with the panel controls.
Each contributing their sounds, among them are even pace.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds are turned into a piece of music.
This does not seem to upsets the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for the passionate of Krautrock was the fact that the band Harmonia again to make music.
What to reveal here is this: precisely the questions have shown that the name of the gang Retumbaba in the minds of the people, but it was not something special for 32 years after the public the Extrañase both.
But why the Germans can not also applaud his legend lives of the 1970s?
Particularly when the ambiguity Kautrock was always more useful in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a prize of music "ECHO" the members of the gang can 2003 Cologne for his work in the Chamber of life, we could see the faces of artists of pop Germans.
And when network Chili hot peppers to the band the Düsseldorf Neu!, all opened their mouths with astonishment.
Later Michael Rother spent time in the stage during the concert network Chili hot peppers as if it had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance recognition at home and abroad, are only one thing.
It is a problem remind this band, because the trio existed only two years and at that time I fail to a great effect on the public, however, was subsequently thanks to the other.
Already some time ago Moebius and Roedelius had done music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, which promised a lot of fame.
At the beginning Tocaban in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a company of music in Duesseldorf that was Patronizada by a church.
For a while, Rother had a Trabajillo in Kraftwerk and then worked Guitarrista in the band Neu! managed to improve the reputation of this band German In those days was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the musicians of exiled to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruin of the 16th century, living as refugees in the city.
The way of life was less ideological in the Comune I, where Roedelius could complain of its position.
That was more a life of artist full of surprises.
As they say, one day appeared an association of song Harmonia of Ottenstein in the rubbish, which turned out to be a good name for the art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first Albúm be called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "lux".
Although the music was calm and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as artist was not only to find itself.
The CDs "live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone recalls that, in this recording participated almost 50 people.
Then Rother expressed a desire to push through Harmonia and do from time to time trials.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against the customs.
In 1975 the band announced their separation.
Rother ended run into issues of Esoterismo and assured its existence with álbumes as "Flammende."
Revived the 1980s and since that time has had more success of which had Harmonia.
The recording in direct Albúm in Griessmer, that we must thank Groenemeyer.
His company of music Grienland was objective is to cultivate this contribution own German to preserve it as music alive.
As the work of Roedelius, also the band Neu! was again discovered.
The presentation of Harmonia as gang takes place in the House of cultures of the world in Berlin.
The gang was subsidised with public measures of the festival Wordtronics.
There is Julian cope, English, old punk and the author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler."
There is also present Dr Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all the influences of Krautrock to the next pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a Súper-banda, a job that was empty.
The sentence of Brian Eno accompanied with music special fills the room: "this music is the only music, some of it I Partenece the Fúturo."
There are photos Harmonia with producers in a farm.
The history of the development of the legend is in the projections of photos in black and white, where are instruments with cables.
Basically there are three veterans that began to improvise again.
Do nothing more than to set the microphones to the body and the battery to be able to produce some extraordinary tones with the help of the apparatus of effects that they had built with their own hands.
Currently the music is electronic and had to be.
Three people who expand in technology.
But that does not change anything.
Under the leadership of barbaric Morgenstern, in an atmosphere music is coughs, Susurra and at a good time of emphasis is sings "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock already was always a term of origin English.
But it was never rock.
Not sought the origin of gender in the blues, but in schools of music (can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing the conventions artistic and social ().
Here who shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia retains the calm.
In the scenario is considering very well on what is already clear.
Where it begins and where it ends music?
This can be broken one the nerves or give rapid moment of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "the hunting party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" engaged again to the war in the Balkans.
But the two did not have much conviction.
Or the concepts are set much into action and Tirotes or the two films are Demasiando exciting.
Richard Gere with its "the hunting party" can not help in this case.
At the beginning there was a good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war criminals, are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but there, in the dark inside the country during the war in Bosnia, was found again the actor Richard Gere.
Finally we had lost sight of the man most of the 1980s, because nobody wanted to see it after their roles pleasant and minor in films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the film "the hunting Party - when a hunter becomes what pursued" (why today the titles of the films have to be so long and?).
The film has a wonderful presentation to see: basically, reporter its role in the war is the presentation of what could make Richard Gere, if the destination and the film industry had not been so with him. He was a man whose better days of life, which as a monument to the ruin of their decline preserving so far much of its charm.
"The hunting party", despite this triumph, together with "Moerderischer Frieden" that is production German and will also be presented this week, turn out to be only a series of films without success on the war in the Balkans.
Can the film "Moerderischer Frieden" In short: these are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbia of the Francotiradores of Kosovo, one of them is acting very quickly and that it also leads to Enamore of it.
The effect of the film is lost by the actions and the shootings, although we welcome the fact that the Serbs are not presented once more as the only culprits.
The film series is like the German "alarm takes on 11" without motorway, but in war situation.
In the example of "the hunting party" can investigate, because it was never a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another author of script (Richard Shepard in two posts), the history of American reporters in the war that is going to detect a Serbian war criminal called "Fox" probably could be a new "Now".
In this way, the stories are remarkably similar: the small teams are twice the mountains for something that can not do the army and it is becoming a journey in madness.
One reason for the failure of "the hunting party" is at the beginning when we are presented with Simon, whom he can not be simply a cynic with heart.
No, the script also provides for an adventure loving Bosnia with a Muslim that will kill then.
Then "the hunting party" is very far from the reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with an impressive quickly achieve what they could not achieve for five years NATO, the CIA and all the hunters head of the world, which was to catch the war criminal and leave them to the Bosnians Musulmanos to Vengaran in a way that is fair.
It is so badly, that tempted to appeal to the International Court in The Hague based on the Crimenes against Logica Cinematica.
However, the aim of the film is, in fact, one Profondamente human.
The Pelicula want to condemn the fact that Karadi and Mladi Esten even free, and emphasises that the Americans and the French are not really concerned to pursue them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so that we have in mind a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this Peoma it is a mask of a demon Asia: "in the Gandes brow of his face see it, sharing the feelings with him, which is hard to be bad."
In films such as "the hunting party" there are also these demons but they show that it is hard to be good.
The problem is not only in the kind of films of war in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper wrote that all films on Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
You can also add that there has never been a good film on South Africa.
Almost always better to have a rule: when a star is put by a region of crisis or by the minefields, then is something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "across all borders," with Angelina Jolie or "diamonds Sangrientes" with Leonardo Dicaprio.
Perhaps all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
Must go at least decades until Hollywood Ruede a good film on the Holocaust taking as an example the film "the list of".
Some films already need more time. The classic as works on the Vietnam War in "the deer hunter," "Now" or "full metal Jackett" in his times were not concluded by unanimity as the masterpieces.
Perhaps today we know too much about world conflicts, and therefore in our times each massacre (Massenmord) has been tabled directly in two television at home.
And that is because the perpetrators of script they have no objection (which is necessary for power) in good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "the great dictator" turned out so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still did not know that such a bad was actually the Nazi regime.
Perhaps not to be a good person to rolling a film.
Perhaps we need to be as novelist Lawrence Norfolk, looking sarcastic and distant of an artist.
When asked to him about the parallels between his historical novel "dictionary of Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "that is just not that some things never change."
The big cities always will be in danger, the men are always going to be killed cruelly and Yugoslavia always reign war.
Von Beust receives in response criticism negative on the Olympic Games.
The Mayor of Hamburg received a lot of criticism of the politics and economics not to apply for the Olympic Games in the summer.
Many want to continue the fight for competitions in the section of water sports.
But Beust reminds us that we have to be realistic to assess the possibilities.
Hans-joerg Schmidt-trenz, Director-General of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, said on Wednesday this resignation as "not good for the site economic."
In recent times no other project in the big city triggered so much motivation as the idea of the organisation of the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective would not be able to maintain the political momentum, sports at the same level."
Schmidt-trenz called on the Senate not forget this project, but to find a new application long-term "that relates to another time."
On Wednesday the mayor Ole von Beust kept their statements that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organisation of the Olympic Games in the summer were not carried out until at least the year 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the request for the Olympic Games, but that is decided by the Federation of German Olympic sports," says von Beust in the online.
Sent to the decision of the Federation of sport (Sportbund) that is expected in early December, on the request of Munich for the Olympic Games in the winter of 2028.
"This preference means for us that during this period of time, we thought that until now have until 2028, from the point of view realistic we will not have a chance."
Nevertheless, this dream not ended forever, said von Beust.
The Federation of sport in Hamburg (Hsb) regrets the statements of von Beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It is too early to take the opportunity, if the plans are ruined," he said on Wednesday Günter Ploß, the director of Hsb.
A renunciation of the request is contradictory to the statement made by the head of the Senate made in a reception at the general meeting of the Federation of German public sport of universities (Adh).
There von Beust appointed the request of Hamburg to Universiadas 2015 as "not a replacement" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week, the Federation of sport of the universities appointed Hamburg as a candidate of the request.
The fraction of the Social Democrat Party (German Spd-bürgerschaftsfraktion) blamed in the Senate who do not take the time is so valuable for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate delaying with the development of the small district of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or building houses," said Veit and Jan Quast, Members of the German Social Democrat (SPD).
While the SPD always called for an integrated planning of Olympia for small Grasbrook and then the use of houses built, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, the request of Hamburg for the Olympic Games in the summer of 2012 caused a great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It is not the boxes of wood.
Who linked the terms Sweden and box of wood, think Ikea, but I do not think Andy Warhol.
Or has it?
currently boxes of wood produced in Sweden are like the shadow hanging over the list of works of Warhol.
Most of the 1990s and four Brillo-box of "type" of this list are false.
After a few months ago the newspaper Expressen "doubt about the authenticity of Brillo-boxes of Warhol modern Museet Stockholm made disappointing: six" Brillo-boxes ", that the Ex-director museum Pontus Hulthén gave the museum modern Museet, are false, and almost 100 of the other type of" Stockholm, "which on the road in the market, are too.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between production and artistic Patrocionadas.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York its first "Brillo-boxes", painted wood boxes of red, blue and white, with the same shows that had cartons of soap powder "glare".
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of their works 1968 in the museum modern Museet were exposed hundreds of Brillo-cajas cardboard. These did not Warhol (as a result of the expenditure), but were brought directly from the factory cardboard "glare".

On the contrary, the structure of the copies of the 1990 shows that the paint was applied with a steamroller without print directly Platas serried. In addition it is not a question of the paint, but the paint Acrílica.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from the official list of Brillo-boxes of Warhol," says Lars Nittve, the director of the museum modern Museet and adds that if the Commission of "Warhol art" in New York will not come to any conclusion, the museum modern Museet Clasificará these six boxes as copying / objects of exposure.
