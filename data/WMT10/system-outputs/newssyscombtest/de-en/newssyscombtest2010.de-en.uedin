A lack of snow in the mountains haunts the hotel owner
Scneelose Pisten Sorgenn make not only the giant mountains-local residents.
The lack of snow discourages people from appointment of Skiaufenthalte in hotels and guest houses.
So you can get in Giant still free room for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, prices note, but now they have to order fear, binding.
And if they will call us, they immediately ask whether we believe this year's Christmas on snow or "have to wake up," the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura led.
If you want to the New Year's Eve-stay in the Spindelmühle just after his ideas, should no longer hesitate with the appointment.
Anyone who prefers saving and where the quality of the mission comes in second place, which can try to wait a few days.
The Spindelmühle-hotel owners offer now for the Silvestertag mostly just weeks stays.
I think that they will endeavour for a while to sell them, but then they have to give in and comment on shorter hours.
And the free rooms will then quickly evaporate Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter dates is always, always a travel agent in Ingtours Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, meanwhile, is not yet sold out.
In our supply about half of the seats is still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas respites for the last moment, the director of the travel agents Ingtours, Petr Schiefert led.
The Silvestertag in Giant can offer the Vrchlabi-travel agency, but there are fewer free seats.
Good (also find the first 14 days in February, the rest of the winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest is influenced by stays for the winter, too bad that no snow lies in Giant ever.
People wait to see whether snow falls.
No one wants to spend the end of the year without snow in the mountains.
The space of a week Pisten should be verschneit this Christmas will also be sold out, Schiefert says.
Conversely, and slightly better than in last year, we need to fill the rooms in the hotel horizon in Pecpod Snezkou succeeds.
We are around five percent better than in the previous year.
The Silvestertag and at Christmas, we have only a few more free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holiday in Janua, and in February, the business will also run well, the director of the best Pec-hotels, Karel Rada informed.
About 80 percent for the New Year's Eve stays is also filled the Omnia Hotel in Central Park Square in Janske Lazne.
Even half the beds, however, remains free on Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
Pleasantly surprised us in this year of January, for which we are currently occupied at around 60 percent.
A bit weaker of February is now, but at the very moment when the snow comes, is increasing the interest also determined to the periods spent in Giant, the director of the Omnia hotels, Erik Sporysch led.
On a more snow Mess the Giant-hotel owners now wait.
On Thursday it should cool themselves and if there is rainfall, that should be snow on the mountains.
But after a warming is to come back, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the site of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove.
United States: Repetition is mother of wisdom
It is almost comical, repeatedly with what Schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the President with his reputation of Klügsten, the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan issue, which he believed, even for the most stupid.
Finally, as he awaited his ausschwitzte Afghanistan Doctrine, it emerged that he abschrieb these on the Kopierpapier from the Bush-Iraq Szenariovor three years ago.
Not only that he in the text itself has repeatedly used the phrase "just as in Iraq," he has even used the name of the Bush statement in January 2007 as the name of its own declaration: "New Vorwärtsweg" without the fence.
He has criticised even three years ago, the Bush idea - fresh troop contingents in the troubled by the civil war of sending Iraq - as "irresponsible and in its conclusions karastrophische decision".
Subsequent months showed, however, that the recommendations of the military outgoing Bush is the only possible strategy and was very successful to the extent that there is talk today on the news about Iraq.
The Bush's reputation has not been improved by objective because he has left behind his successor a much dankbarere starting situation, as it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle is repeating itself.
By increasing the troop contingent have asked him to reintroduce the military, especially the supreme commander of the Afghanistan-Operation General Stanley McCristal, even despite the Subordinationsgewohnheiten criticized zaudernden gunman in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers in order to reverse the situation for the better.
The president postponed three months, but came to no better idea, and so he has betrayed the General wenistens about 10,000 soldiers.
He has a commitment from Europe for another 5,000 pressed, even though he originally projected themselves with at least 10,000.
Highly problematic about the whole Obama strategy is its plan to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan in just 18 months, and complete the process within three years. The entire Obama Doctrine has left more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the cut increase in the same effect as the measure will bring in Iraq.
Also, despite the fratricidal war of recent years, the Iraq is relatively well-structured society, its leaders honour the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the cons indication - you can rely on second and there are no agreements.
Under these circumstances, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces that are used to every day to change their mind.
The political institutions, even if they were established formally correct, will remain only bogus construction, behind which the patriarchal tribe relations can excel on.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the confusion of the conditions that complicate the Pakistan- and Iran-influences.
The building of a "strong state", which is the minimalist objective of the whole operation is very unrealistic.
Time horizon of the Obama strategy puzzled by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated further, and now it is on the verge of explosion.
Due to the fact that the small soldiers that have broken out in the war cries about the "early return" create a miracle here believe, can only a truly romantic soul that is not influenced by facts.
From the political point of view, setting the date for the withdrawal of troops sheer irresponsibility, because the Taliban will resume as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit demonstrated that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fray in Afghanistan is running out.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their constituents, in what way the safety of Germany or Italy is connected with the war in the Hindu Kush-Gebirgsvorland.
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically, the development of events in Iran.
Should the situation continue to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not work, the United States is a very serious question arises of whether the problem was not resolved with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America after Obama is the winner withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation plaster for Barack Obama is the fact that still has three years left before the presidential election, and therefore still have enough time, so that it can take up to a different strategy remains fallls would prove that as a total loss.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs received no bonuses in cash bonuses more
The chief executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will receive no bonuses this year more bonuses in cash.
It has announced the company is responding to the sharp criticism of its pay practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of money, but we can only sell in five years.
In addition, the stock can be removed from the managers in the case if they act excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs is so according to the Reuters news agency at the forefront of efforts, the premium bonuses of Wall Street in order to connect with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street is aware of the wider direction in which it has to go, the former banker JPMorgan's society, Douglas Elliott led.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made the target of criticism after she had for the first three quarters of this year put nearly $17 billion for bonuses bonuses aside.
The total amount of bonuses bonuses in the course of this Jahra, according to the Reuters news agency will probably also indicated today despite the measure exceed $20 billion.
The high premiums bonuses in the banking sector have become with the start of the financial crisis in a whole series of Länders the most burning political issue.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to the bonuses of the bankers who exceed £25,000 to strain unique with a tax of 50 per cent.
Similar steps are also preparing for France.
This year, women have won the Nobel prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record women have taken in Stockholm today from the hands of Sweden desKönigs Carl XVI Gustaf this year's Nobel prizes in the technical categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists including the German writer of Romanian Abkunft, Herta Müller was under, including.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine two American Biologinnen, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with her compatriot Jack Szostak Chromosonen for research in the area.
The prize for chemistry, the Israeli Ada Jonath has, together with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for informing Ribosom received-structure and -Funktion.
The final Laureatin awarding the Nobel Prize for economics, the American, her compatriot Elinor Ostrom and Oliver Williamson have received for analysis of the economic report.
The only specialist category in which this year, no woman received a Nobel Prize, was physics.
This prize today, the scientist Charles Kao won for research in the glass fibre-area and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD-chip-invention, which is the basis of all Digitalkammeras, fax machines or astronomical distant water pipes.
Each of the winners received the diploma, the Nobelmedaile and certificate on the acquisition of money prize.
The totals in each category of ten million Swedish kronor.
If there are several winners in each category, the prize money will be shared between them.
Traditionally has received the American President, Barak Obama, the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
He acknowledged in his speech the Kontrovere his appointment, because it is only the beginning of his journey, and it is also at the forefront of the country, the two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In respect of his policy, he added, however, that wars in certain situations are for the Erkämpfen world peace, even if the price is so high.
Ministers Janota is considering the resignation, Klaus has invited him into the Burg
President Vaclav Klaus receives on Friday morning, the Treasury Secretary, Eduard Janota who thinks about his continued presence in the government because he is in agreement with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form in which that was released by the Assembly on Wednesday, not.
It is thought that the budget and perhaps also the continued presence of Janota will be in the cabinet the themes of the Friday meeting.
The budget will also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepened the crisis in the public finances.
In addition to the coincidence informed the presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
In addition to be further Janota stay in his post on Monday with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer wants to negotiate.
After the budget-law which now receives Klaus's signature, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
In Parliament on the Left Party-proposals were voted on Wednesday but the monetary upheaval and the money for the civil servants' salaries, increased for the maintenance of the social services and direct wages of farmers.
The government has told the proposals of social democracy that masks they increase the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party, on the one hand, and of the government, Mr Klaus and legal party, on the other hand, dessentwegen pays the question mark over the future work of the Fischer-official cabinet, on the design of the ODS and CSSD and Green Party agreed in the spring has arisen because of a sharp domestic political dispute.
Critics claim that the budget was adopted in the parliament, which practically liquidated package of austerity measures imposed by the Fischer- government in the fall, and that is to end after their understanding of the national debt.
Mr Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but need not, said today in the discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected the "serious problem" that is "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances, the longer term.
In his view, there is no good solution.
An improvement could only bring a strong government that could build on top of a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS-chairman, Mirek Topolanek, stated that the budget is appalling, and the government should weigh their continued existence.
The ODS-Stellvorsitzende, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently does not work anymore.
Prime Minister Fischer described in the editorial similar words as "strong Aussprüche."
The CSSD-leader, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek-words that the budget deficit is horrifying that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion kronor.
Already on Wednesday CSSD evaluated the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
Even the People's Party was satisfied.
Mandela was in the new movie by Clint Eastwood played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood shows-film "Invictus: The Ungeschlagene" of the world, much of the country from its fight and victories despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sports, racial backgrounds and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid system of government in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in his life story of American Oscar-actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela, whether he could represent him in Eastwood- film.
A further important role Matt Damon.
I said to him: "If I will play you, I must take you.
The zweiundsiebzigjährige actors who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood-drama from the Boxbereich "Million Dollar Baby", was already the leader of the Movement for the abolition of slavery, become from the end of the slave owners, is a fictional US president, and God in "Evan omnipotent", but rarely someone who is still alive, and for many people is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was for his active career in the end of apartheid in South African Republic of 27 years in prison.
He was set in 1990 to free foot undfür four years, he has been president of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is ungeschlagen the Latin word for "," and at the same time, this is the name of a Gedichtes of the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was to speak as he
The film recounts a real moment in the Nelson Mandela his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, closed together to reach the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people also remains after apartheid increasingly divided races moderately and economically.
He believes that he can unite his people by the sport, so he decides to some of the rugby players who are part of the world's outsiders.
Finally, the South African team to rise up in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years to bring the Mandela-history on the cinema screen.
He had to bring no other purpose but to play that role, such as closely as possible the reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was of course, to speak as it.
The actor said that if he and the world leaders would be in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela to eat with him and to be with his speech behind the scenes.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela's hand.
I noticed that if I schüttele you the hand, I accept your energy, they will be transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you are, he said.
For me, it is important to become a different person.
Matt Damon François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team is in the film that have prevailed in the white players.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him, when he met Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember, when I rang the door bell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: "In the movie I see much bigger".
Despite the apparent differences in the stature of the actor in comparison with their actual role models, he has received under the guidance of director Eastwood "Invictus: Ungeschlagen" welcome reviews and it also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the newspaper Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his assessment in the following words: "That was very good story, very well ausgeführter film."
In the Filmrezensionen on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus 76 percent positive assessments has received.
Light secret about Norway dissolved: The Russians have tested a missile
Via Norway, a special light effect was observed of unknown origin.
The Russian defence ministry has admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
The launch was not yet successfully and as a type "Bulava" missile, which was to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming a nightmare of Russian Generalität and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, will be.
His continued presence on the ground in the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Launched Bulava is usually not been damaged or in the air.
In Russian newspapers, one already writes about "Bulava" than about a "missile that flies."
A missile that flies, but quite
This already 13th attempt at the beginning was normal.
It was only at the end of the flight technical damage are, in turn, occurred in the missile.
Presumably, the engine exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time, launched "Bulava" from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij that went under the water of the White Sea.
This Raketentyp enables the firing from the submarine.
Therefore, the result of an unspecified fliegendes object causing mysterious lights on North because actually was the damaged "Bulava" is likely.
Moreover, the Norwegians since the first moment did not doubt that that it is a Russian rocket.
The Generalität has kept this time against and claimed that one cannot speak clearly from a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket fell from the accident and not from the third stage was only affected.
In the previous cases, the same engines were damaged in the first stage.
Although no test launch was carried out without a mistake, the leadership of the Defense Department considers only six out of thirteen for unsuccessful.
Of the nearly 50% success so the Generalität met with optimism and so that the "Bulava" will fly again without problems and even to ten Hyperschall-nuclear warheads with a total weight of Max. 1.15 tonnes will continue to pay claims.
The legendary Fetisov has signed with 51 years, one-year contract with the CSKA Moscow
The legendary defensive players Vjaceslav Fetisov envisage with 51 years in turn in a professional-Eishockeyspiel.

After Denis Kuljas wounded, we urgently need a further defensive players.
Fetisov has trained regularly and agreed that he will support the team.
We need to clarify a few remaining formalities, the agency quoted AP the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous Eishockeyspielers will affect only a game.
I believe that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, players Nemcinov listed.
If comes back to the Eisfläche Fetisov, according to AP, he is the oldest Russian professional Eishockeyspiel.
In the NHL, the legendary strikers Gordie Howe played with einundfünfzig years a whole season for durum Ford and 15 hits and 26 letter Assistenzen could benefit.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful Eishockeyspieler in history.

Hyundai has been the unions after. All overtime will be lifted
The management of Nosovice-car factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the lifting of all overtime.
Because often overtime set the union announced on Monday the strike call.
The spokesman confirmed the car factory Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
The board wants to do a deal with the unionists still on a Saturday classes this week.
We must not abandon our manufacturing plan, which is a principle, therefore, was on Saturday, 19 December, proposed voluntary overtime for the reason that two layers of work to be done, said Vanek.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company would have the staff that the Saturday shift work, offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
The staff also received after the event for which Saturday class of 28 November.
Vanek has decided, according to the company, the motivation kind of staff for the proposed overtime to change.
Either they can pay the overtime pay or they can take for that replacement holidays on 28 December, and so the Christmas holidays, led to Vanek.
In addition, all members of the Saturday section will pay their fares and lunch.
With regard to the fact that the overtime of the most pressing and most burning point about demands and complaints were the trade unionists, who had stopped production last week, the board has decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the lifting of all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk listed.

Until this September here around 80,000 vehicles were produced, the current production capacity of 200,000 vehicles a year.
Czech discovery: A substance that acts in ´ tempered like steel ´ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists testing new compounds designed to prevent the spread of HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of improved substance is that he is also in the viruses that are resistant to drugs.
This fact has fallen against the disadvantage that the link on standard virus-variants is not as strong as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured.
The patients on the drug combination but can prolong the lives and prevent the propagation of HIV virus in the body.
Their use is accompanied by a whole series of side effects.
Partial suppression of the virus-proliferation has also developing sg. Resistant viruses, against which no drugs are more effective.
The work of the experts from the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (chemically-Technological High School) Prague, from the University of Heidelberg opens the way of how to deal with the virus-resistant.
They have proven that the substances known as Metalokarborane effect on the protein stuff for the propagation of the HIV-Viruses responsible.
The Metalokarborane are links of boron and hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus-reproduction in other ways than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance-problem.
In her work, the scientists reach new ´ improved ´ compounds which have been prepared on the basis of knowledge of the Molekularmechanismus their attachment to the viral protein substance.
The Metalokarborane have a unique dreidimensionale structure: Two vielfächige cages composed of Bor-, hydrogen and carbon atoms and through a metal-nuclear are coupled in this case with cobalt.
Heinous and consistent virus
HIV Protease is protein substance of the HIV virus that is for the life cycle of the virus is essential.
Without the HIV-Protease caused by the HIV virus-division would be no mature infectious virus particles.
If we switch off the HIV Protease, we are also thrust the propagation of the virus in the body of the patient, the researchers in the press report, from the Institute for organic chemistry, biochemistry and given out by the Academy of Sciences CR.
The work was published in Science newspaper Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole rows of compounds where two couples of cages (see table) through a brief organic chain linked to the changes then systematically further.
Slightly weaker, but reliable
The impact of this series of substances against the HIV-Protease wurdne tested in Reagenzglas, even against their steady (resistant) variations which were won by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of the Metalokarborane in the usual enzyme-variant is not as strong as in the clinically used medicines, but they do not lose their effects on the resistant variants, against the use of medicines are often ineffective.
The unique effect mechanism and its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical ways, makes the Metalokarboranen too interesting links for further on the development of effective medicines against HIV research aimed to Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory says for structural biology of the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics, of the Institute for the National Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over budget. ODS backfired on fishermen, the Fights Back
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "terrifying" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, in his view, consider their continued existence.
The statement of the ODS described the Prime Minister as a "strong Aussprüche."
Supposedly it is time for the analysis.
The deputy ODS-Chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet works with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party now longer.
After the Prime Minister is Necas must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in parliament for the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it be through him to stay in office of Parliament left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed differently, Necas pointed out.
Parliament on Wednesday adopted the budget for the year 2010, but with Link party-amendments on more than 12 billion kronor.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of the social services, and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has told about the proposals of the social democracy that masks they increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should operate with a backlog of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, so it has fulfilled the wishes of the government, because the amended budget is just a few bad variant of Budgetprovisoriums. Frase not clear
Disappointment and futility
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has argued that the government's assessment of the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota would have seriously threatened with his resignation in the event that the amendment proposals were adopted, the situation would be different.
Under the Czech Television Janota has declared on Monday after the government business in the Premier.
He has indicated that he would be further considered staying in office.
This reason is his disappointment on the Verhandugn of the budget.
The extent to which fishermen for the continuing battle with the budget-deficit comes out, so that in accordance with Necas have) the Nominanten the Social Democrats (CSSD who had pushed through the changes in the budget to do nothing in the government.
The Premier should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament adopts continue to deficit-boosting laws, for example, sick pay and pensions or the service laws should be changed.
Topolanek: The ODS is not nominated ministers
That is a matter for the Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The result of the ODS nominated ministers made no mistake, Topolanek stressed in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that people are in some ministries in co-operation with top 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that, if fishermen in favour decides to give up the fight against the deficit-level of public finances, "it is completely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in Parliament".
Then he cannot expect allegedly with the support and tolerance of the Civic Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if that will be up to date, then I will deal with that, by the Civic Democrats nominated Defense Minister Martin Bartak said the journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer flew in the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS came at the request of the Premier back
At the same time Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote on Wednesday in Parliament against the revised budget, if the Premier ask Members of the Civic Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We are not as orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question of whether the ODS has not been diminished in the political negotiation of the budget by the absence of the party leader in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I would not have noticed that my voice is lacking.
As I have already eschewing the mandate, I knew that in coming months, in particular, would be about Bolschewisierung of Parliament and destruction of all positives, Topolanek even responded.
Under the new map of the CD (Czech Railways) fewer trains will travel for roughly the same fare.
The Czech Railways stopped or restricted from 13 December some less ausgelastete Schnell- and local trains, other links to be strengthened against.
The whole transport volume is reduced from the validity of day of the new road map compared with today at 2%.
Most tariffs incl. Basic and customer journey Arif will not change.
Several link opportunities in the capital received, for example, the residents of Ostrava-zone, the railway uses for this line of type Pendolino trains.
The drive by express train will no longer after Bratislava (former Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also go by the wayside Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle, the direct links from Prague be reduced after Letohrad.
The biggest reduction plans the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (King Graz), for a total of eight per cent, against a rise in Prague and surrounding areas can be pleased.
Also lifted two night trains on the route from Prague Budweis Tabor, and on some days in the week of the works of some fast trains on the route from Prague Budweis Pisek - will be reduced.
One of the biggest changes to the introduction of the new direct transport route heard from Milovice to Prague, must now switch in the inhabitants of Milovice Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of suburban transport system Esko, whose opening is thanks to the rail electrification from Lysa nad Labem after Milovice possible.
The long-distance routes in the capital will end in the target station Prague - main railway station.
The CD introduces more links between Prague and SC Pendolino Ostrava and the trains after Sumperk / Jesenik will drive in the space of two hours.
With the Pendolino passengers since 13 December can no longer go to Bratislava.
This year's bill for regional rail: Increase of 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid for by the Transport Department, overall, the railway to reimburse the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, receives four billion kronor, how has this year. The local trains supply the districts, overall they pay in next year, eight billion kronor, while the state zuschießt three billion.
This year, the regional trains 200 million Czech crowns are more expensive.
For the local trains, as well as the fast trains has completed the railway a ten-year contract, until now, it had only ever for a year.
The railway praises the system, they may not have also resorted to the increase in the price of the vast majority of tickets.
To changes occur only in one-day closed-door Netzfahrscheinen CD Net and favourable Internetfahrscheinen eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card is increased the price CD Net of 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of the drive eLiska will then depend on myself caught until now he was for travel between any district towns in a consistent and cost 160 kroner.
Filipino Millitante firmly take more than 50 persons, the children were freed.
Millitante abducted today in the south of the Philippines 75 people, including some basic pupils and their teachers.
This has led the agency AFP, who informed originally only about 65 abducted.
All 17 children held have been released after eight hours, including a teacher.
The kidnapping occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Roughly 19 Millitante allegedly used the hostages as a live shield on the run from the police.
The local negotiators are now committed to the publication of the remaining hostage.

Jancura collects for libel cases against three head of the CSSD.
The owner of the student Agency, Radim Jancura, collects today for libel cases against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of southern Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the region Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a zwanzigminütigen Inteview on radio Journal.
The complaint is connected with the effort by the company to operate the regional train services in some districts.
All regions have signed but at the end of the long-term contracts with the Tschechischer railway.
All three managers are attacking us and say that we could remove the cherries, we have tabled the offer only on the size, as it voted with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech Railways, because we were aware of the prices of the Czech Railways, over the last week.
So nothing different option but to defend than us.
Because of this defamation of society student Agency, Jancura told the Radio Journal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he has evidence from all districts that they have made their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a trial for the European Commission.
Hasek thinks the collection of the complaint for further continuation of Medialshow of Jancura that him as free advertising for the Company serves, as well as for his own person.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good name and reputation in my region, and I urge other managers.
I assume that will also be in this matter clearly that it is Jancura, manipulated into the cause of the public and used Regionaleinsenbahnverkehrs lügenhafte and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura already reported last week that he had invested several million kronor in the advertisement, which will highlight the damaging step of districts.
The Radio Journal, he said that he cut the campaign after Christmas and New Year wants to continue that.
He clarified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign has launched Jancura after the districts agreed at the behest of the regional rail transport with the Czech Railways and had the task in a High advertised by 150 billion kronor no tenders.
After Vancura such behaviour is illegal and incompatible with the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the movement of trains in the districts threatened him, according to Jancura, already a Member of the CSSD.
The only threat is if we do not abandon it, that we can lose the Buslizenzen.
He presented himself as a Member of the CSSD, I know who they are, his name, I am not saying today Jancura told the Radio Journal.
Vaccination against Pneumokokken free of charge and
Imfung against Pneumokokken changes from January the usual.
It is to be a first for the family for free and voluntary.
But now voices that the duty-vaccination report would be more effective.
Culminate the preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against Pneumokokken.
The medicinal institute already set the maximum price of vaccines that have to pay for the health insurance.
The experts are also on the vaccination procedure in the clear.
New-vaccination
Free vaccines for August-Children
From January children cannot be vaccinated against free Pneumokokken, born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition st that they have still not received a vaccine dose.
Anyone who has already started the vaccine in last year or earlier, further repetition vaccination must also pay for themselves.
The first dose of vaccine should be taken between 3 and 5 living month of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of the families to vaccinate their children against Pneumokokken.
The parents paid 1,600 kroner and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses required.
As a whole, the experts estimate that the health insurance spending for the vaccination doses of 300,000-450 kroner per year.
They would save but in the treatment that need the children without vaccination.
Until now, the state has spent on all land vaccination of children around 500 000 per year.
The duty-vaccination was introduced with the so-called "Janota package.
Pneumokokken Mittelohrentzündung cause, but also serious infections including Gehirnhautentzündungen and blood poisoning.
By Pneumokokkeninfektionen die in our investigation in hospitals per year for up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years.
Outside the Czech Republic's duty-vaccination of children was introduced against Pneumokokken in some 40 countries.
Will be the vaccination requirement?
At the same time that this vaccine could be required in the future.
From January, this is to be paid for by the insurance and voluntarily.
That the duty-vaccination would be better, for example, the head of the citizens association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky mentioned.
His association already advertises for the long term Pneumokokken-vaccination.
The experts at the international conference in which our group was involved, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
That is not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have managed to impose at least that.
I believe that this is the direction we must go now, Kalovsky led.
The health department does not want but that vaccination procedure against Pneumokokken change.
At that moment, we do not consider that anything, his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen said.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, the doctors say.
The chairman of the specialist company of practical Kinderärzten, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then you might think about the reduction of reoffending vaccination number "In a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive we understand the political decision that this vaccine was launched as a voluntary," allerdingst Cabrnochova says.
The experts expect that more than 80 percent of parents to vaccinate their infants against Pneumokokken from next year.
Vaccination against Pneumokokken is also full of significance in the fact that this is paid as a first set-vaccination of the health insurance and not by the state.
The insurance should spend the money for prevention, so that they save for further treatment, erkärt Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
So that is a concern of the practical Kinderärzte is linked, which is buying the vaccines.
After the initial project vaccines should be purchased by insurance companies and doctors will receive this in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
Some Members feared that the insurance so could "the money from the health insurance issues result".
Therefore, the doctors will buy the vaccines themselves and must wait until the insurance companies pay for them this.
According to the estimates by the individual practitioners will invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be at all easy Cabrnochova says.
They and we still
Can be Islam French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters have voted for a ban on building minarets and is widespread concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John has Bowen, an American academic, wrote a thorough and thoughtful report on whether Muslims in one of the avowedly säkularisiertesten societies of Europe — can be integrated and be integrated.
Some readers will read this new book from admiration for the last station of the author: "Why do the French 'no scarves love" (the original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely argumentierenden study of a contentious issue which divided the country about one and a half decades and employed and whose effects are still visible.
Bowens neustes book offers a more comprehensive and kühneres spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he would like to know not only what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what happens on the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutions that are now the 5-6 million Muslims in France, as it is called Bowen offer "Islamic free spaces."
He is a good listener, he reflects debates between teachers and students, on the issues that concern them most.
Should marry a Muslim in a mosque or a City Hall (or both)?
Young Muslims should be lectured about evolution and gay rights?
Can marry a Muslim woman a non-Muslim man?
It is permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-oriented banking system in order to get a mortgage?
There are these seemingly more down-to-earth matters, he claims, which account for the day-to-day life, unlike the political dramas of the media.
The author acknowledges a new generation of Imamen, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a familiar name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab-Muslim scholars and academics.
This new generation tries to reopen the debate about how it is possible to be both a good Muslim, and on the other hand, a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have not all arguments on their side.
The conservatives are wary of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who quizzed Bowen, are with their Salafi counterparts usually divided – supporters of the puristischen Sunni Islam, which is in contact with Saudi Arabia – the show today, a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires give and take on both sides.
He calls into question the extent to which French policymakers (and the intellectual elite) watches as passionate the separation of church and state feel obliged to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may have experienced a rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who make their historic compromise with the secular Republicanism.
Rather, he sees a "tightening of the screw values" as a growing pragmatism.
Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The most dismal outlook for the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that it marks, is melting at an alarming speed and takes life that can survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, Schifffahrts- and fishing interests have placed themselves in the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers, and now also authors in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and Illustrator, paints in "On thin ice" (the original title: "On Thin ICE"), a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bears.
Familiar with the complex history and politics to whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arktiserforscher who have proved themselves in the hunt for the polar bears.
Admiral Nelsons encounter with a polar bears as a brave 14-year-old Fähnrich sea, fought only with his rifle butt Muskete, is certainly a myth, but others are true.
Young bears caught than schwammen behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers, have been brought in zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the twentieth century demonstrated 75 polar bears in a presentation.
Even today Zooanlagen typically still have a million thirtieth of the living area of a wild Alttiers. The climate is rarely appropriate: The Eisbär in Singapore was quite green of the algae that grow in the hollow hair of his skin.

Ellis refers to the reports of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat, the hunter for the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, which continues succumbed in Greenland and Canada, where hunters use in helicopters and engine sleigh-travelling Inuit powerful assault rifles to express their prey on the route.
Ironically, the ice is in the waters of the north of these two hunting nations remain the longest.
In his new book "After the ice" (the original title "what the ICE") Alun Anderson, a former editor of Science magazine New Scientist, "a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a rabble-understanding of how the future might turn out.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheres Ozeanografen scientists still cannot explain the speed of change.
But that is not from a lack of explanation testing.
The pioneering tours of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century could be imagined for the first time, the Verwirbelung of the Pack ice.

A useful adjunct therapy are satellite measurements and the widespread application of Messsonden on Eisbergen, but still a lot like going through brave people out in the cold.
Anderson casts a glance into the curious, tiny world of flow system within the Arctic ice that formed by Salzwasserrinnsale will be brought together in the run.
But, starting from the bear on the ice until the microscopic marvels in the ice, all of them are under threat if the Somme rice passes once, which is expected in the period between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ago … that We could be"
Marines were among the 6,000 who put down in Arlington placed wreaths
The Obergefreite De "Angello Robinson arrived with seven hours by bus to lay a wreath at the grave of a soldier, whom he had never met.
For him and the other marines that the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, made at the national cemetery in Arlington to decorate with graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they came into force.
In a few months, from where we will be returned, we can do it, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we had that, I wish someone would do the same thing for me, so I try to show my respect as.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to put placed wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington-cemetery.
Worcester Morrill, holders of the Company in Worcester Trauerkranzherstellers Wreath Harrington, Maine, founded in 1992 this tradition, as he and some others decided to dekorieren hundreds of graves at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make the trip each year to keep in various cities along the route to carry out events that are given to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America) (placed wreaths across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year, more than 16,000 volunteers placed wreaths laid at the graves at the Arlington-cemetery in areas at the Pentagon, on graves of National cemetery in Fayetteville Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York and at the memory-site for the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation has donated for the second time, more than 150,000 dollars for purchase and transport of placed wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, and who are 70, from Westminster said that she has made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldiers.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, said Hunt, and who are this is their way to give back to the victims.
She said that this is a small contribution, how can we support civilians our soldiers.
It is like the visit of a family grave site.
Situated warmer clothes wrapped in the volunteers migrated across the vast lawn land and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers were older graves from the First and Second World War and the Vietnam War as a target, since these are not visited as often as the newer graves, as the organisers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples remained in hand, while she wore the fresh Kiefernzweige on the grey increasingly grave stones.
Each round wreath at was a dark green with a small red ribbon, which was strapped to the upper section.
The section 60, which is located in the vicinity and where veterans of the wars are mostly buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations cheered 1,000 placed wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars fulfilled this area.
Some wept openly, others prayed and family and friends clung to each other in the icy air.
Some prior to read aloud the names written in stone, while others are twisted descending into small black-white place cards that had been set for those in the moist mud, whose tombstones were not yet ready.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who was crying before the grave of her son bitter tears.
It is 8 hours of driving Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marineinfranterie-Corporal David Shane Spicer, who fell in July in the fight.
No one should ever forget why we are free... that my son has paid for it, she said.
"If I am no longer, I would like to see someone recalls him."
Contractor of the US government of Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor to the U.S. government's Notebook of mobile telephones and computers sold in the country, representatives of the Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, is working for Development alternative, Inc., with headquarters in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients, such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Konsularbeamte the interests of the United States in Havana to try to gain access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charge was not yet published, although a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitors can be arrested after Cuban law for almost everything, on charges of "vulnerability".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities that light protests and critical writings include an arrest risk.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are regarded as a serious crime.
Cuba has pursued a growing bloggers-community, led by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband by government representatives and being attacked.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractors will probably increase the tension between the communist government of Cuba and Castro's brother in the Obama administration, which had sought a "slow" overtures to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night at the New York Times.
The new US policy stresses that the United States will yield a return if the Cuban Government is taking concrete steps in this direction, such as freeing political prisoners and create more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and Notebooks in Cuba are legal, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government employees is $15 per month.
The Cuban government allows only since this year, ordinary citizens with the purchase of a mobile phone, they would be hautsächlich used for the non-text messages, since a 15-minütiges telephone conversation cost a daily wage.
The Internet use is restricted on the island of extreme.
It is in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and in some government departments, like universities, accessible.
Cubans who want to log, often the government must notify their names.
Too many websites access is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens who are in Cuba in prison for crimes such as drug smuggling behind bars, Gloria Berbena, the press spokeswoman of the US interests said in Havana.
Berbena said she could give no further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity which would be in any other free society - the levy legally free mobile phones - a crime is in Cuba, Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the American section of the group Human Rights Watch, who recently, a harsh report said of the freedom in Cuba, entitled "Neuer Castro, the same Cuba issued", an allusion to the investiture of Raul Castro as the leader of the country of the sick older brother Fidel replaced.
Vivanco said that the defendants were very often arrested within a day, convicted and imprisoned.
He said that any solution would probably be politically and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries move towards greater willingness to engage in dialogue with each other.
Pakistani government officials plan to meet to send men into Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered help on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy that sought to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said that they hope that this case could yet to reveal a vast network of terrorist recruitment agencies, was made to the Internet after radicalised young men.
Investigators said that they had sought an opaque insurgents, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had made them, because one of them had delivered on the Internet video site YouTube favourable comments on terrorist attacks.
Saifullah was after her arrival in Pakistan, the leader of the men and tried to help them to reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who was briefed on the matter said on Saturday, Saifullah was not the Al-Qaeda leader that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held on days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far removed from the inhospitable mountains in the north-west, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, the government officials, who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter said.
The government officials said that the men were not discouraged and still tried to get the right advice to gain access to the al-Qaeda camps, when they were arrested by the Pakistani prison authorities.
To be consulted about the case of five men, who remain in Pakistan and by the FBI - the crucial role of recruiting sergeant underscores the identification of future terrorists and possibly even more important, in deciding who is to be trusted.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, it has made the US secret service to a matter of the utmost urgency, host human asset within Al Qaeda.
The recruitment agencies act as guardians of the organization, which is not let those whose commitment not to the holy war seriously enough and those that might be spies.
American would-be recruits undergo of A Qaeda of a specific test, analysts said.
Because of their potential access to U.S. goals and its propaganda value, but they are also viewed as hugely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohl man to rank the highest analyst of the NEFA Foundation, based in the US, said that terrorist groups in recent years have become much more cautious about whom they are allowed access, because the US intelligence experts their recruitment methods become.
If you try to anyone in these groups slot, what better way could there be than the recruitment model to follow, so many have already followed?, said Kohl man.
Now the model is based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators are calling in Copenhagen climate "Action"
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched here on Saturday through the streets and demanded by the negotiators in the Bella-congress centre in the town of kühneres action on climate change.
Protesters said that 100,000 people had joined the rally, while the police estimates were more of around 25,000.
The event passed off relatively peacefully, although a handful of dramatic activists zündete small explosive devices in the vicinity of a number of government buildings in the inner city.
On a day when the UN-sponsored climate talks little happened, thousands of activists with banners had migrated through the city on which in English, "There is no Planet B" and one in Spanish, it stated "The Earth says" enough ".
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the Fotografin Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the land of their birth mother, her heart has to fight with the heart-breaking problems of the country because of the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I chose to participate in the great demonstration - pass to speak and to call on world leaders to get a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around the results.
The police held the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either disguise or pocket knife mitführten.
According to Danish law, these actions are banned during demonstrations.
According to a viewer, who did not want to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, zündeten demonstrators disguised in black dress several explosive devices near the Copenhagen main channel, near where several ministries are located.
They cast it near the building, he said, and added that they began as Leuchtraketen, but by "a few large explosions were" followed.
On the inside of the Congress Centre people gathered in front of television screens to watch the whole afternoon the demonstration.
But the protest has the awareness of the main officials, such as Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator, apparently not.
When he was asked if he thinks that the demonstration would have a positive impact on the international discussion, he replied in English: "That is something that I was not even aware".
He then went into Mandarin and said: "Because of the venue is great, I cannot hear what is happening out there."
He noted that it abhänge from the perspective of the individual, whether the rally would hurt or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "we can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent racial divide
The evidence on the mathematics performance last week was welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the District of Washington is still well short of the schools in the country, the maximum yield benefits to show the evidence that the Viert- Achtklässler and include in the past two years, faster progress than cities, Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made.
But what is in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Education Progress (National Assessment of educational Progress (NAEP) included, is the persistent achievement gap between African American and white pupils, both at local and national level.
The average point number of white Viertklässler from Washington D. C. rose in the past two years of 262 at 270 (on a scale of 500), which has increased its African-American peers but only three points of 209 at 212.
In reality, the achievement gap rose between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African-American Achtklässler remained essentially the same, he fell by a statistically significant point of 245 on 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data, because the spot size was not big enough.
The picture over a six-year period is not encouraging.
The gap, the white and black Viertklässler separated in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, accounted for 60 Skalenpunkte (262 to 202).
And although the item number is to have achieved the children of both groups, grown in that time span, the difference with 58 points now has barely narrowed.
Some education advocates of the southern over last week expressed its concern that the results that have been hailed by Schulkanzlerin Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were driven mostly by white pupils that are already powerful children.
This suggests that we have increased the overall value judgement by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale, what is problematic and difficult, Jeff Smith, member of the board of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that promotes educational equality in Washington D. C. said.
I springe not for a span of two or three points, and Lower, said the democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, a daughter in the fourth class of Eaton-primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said that the message of the study point figures is that the middle schools the city urgently need attention.
Of course, one would ever see the positive signs that I respect.
What frightens me, however, that we should not spend nearly the time and energy that we use for our middle school.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the current weak pupils.
This fall, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new curriculum of reading, the Wilson-reading system, aimed at pupils in the upper classes of elementary school and middle school, the basic skills of reading have not mastered the beginning of their Schullaufbahn and lagging significantly behind their young counterparts classmates.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on the nursery until the sixth class games and real life experience to the fore, was brought under the former chief Schulinspektor Clifford Janey after Washington and this curriculum be attributed some of the NAEP-progress that has been reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to benefit the best measures the pupils who are below the central level, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP can stress-results whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and will continue to play the extra money and resources to put the current weak schools that are necessary to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, Bruce Fuller, a professor of education said at the University of California at Berkeley, studied urban audit results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms at the schools in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could create political fallout that work against this important agenda item.
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban Schulinspektoren they tried that to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We must strengthen our schools in districts so that all families, regardless of where they can live, be sure that their children receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who is now Schulinspektor in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for closing the achievement gap, the traditional public school year, which is currently in Washington 180 days to extend to compete with the charter-school.
We must increase the school year at nearly 200 days in order to have the power to change, Janey, who came with his teachers' union last year to reach agreement on 185 days per year, which he regarded as "a milestone" on the road to a major increase in the next Treaty said.
Higher education for more people than a future
The coach reached the Gettysburg-College with a loud pipes.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 is rising, from and blinzelt a moment on seeing the white pillars of Ziegelsteinfassaden and smaragdgrünen lawn.
Hardly Gracielas parents have completed the High School in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, which was recovered in silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale had also never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and the other Achtklässler the group to explore the Gettysburg, where the teaching 38.690 dollars per year costs of a reverence full visitor, but an enthusiastic future students was more likely.
"Yes, I will soon be here!" Shouted Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the leaders announced that they will now enter the building for science.
"Wow, really?" Said they food for thought, as her the low teacher-to-student ratio of the school reported.
The college in Pennsylvania was the seventh, which visited the children on their three-day tour and now they have included the intended message altogether: The question is not whether it's going to college.
The question is, where.
On the one hand, a growing concern about the high number of children born in the United States hispanischer immigrants, what the High School does not end or as a pregnant teenager, on the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands of what the college education needed to be promoted into the middle class.
In truth, from a closing five of this "second generation" of the college Hispanoamerikaner – which is a remarkable achievement, given that many of their immigrierten parents, mostly from Mexico and Central America into the United States without having completed the High School.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because it is for a generation that play a huge role in the labor force in the country to show the way forward.
Those who study powerful children, say, they often have a natural affinity for the school and its inherent propulsion to success.
Many of them have also find parents who bring their children high goals and ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But advisory programmes also play a major role in helping Graciela and millions of children as they arrive in college, especially if these efforts continue over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them Wegsuche through the system, then a single measure at any time will not solve the problem, Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California at Davis, said that investigated hispanoamerikanische students.
We must consider this child to a supporting network of pre-school until through the High School.
The federal program that had funded Gracielas college-Tour, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR up - a swing high thrust - and is more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems available to launch college-preparation programs that have started if low-income students in the middle school and continue, completed by the High School.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program since 1999, more than 10 million pupils has helped, of which more than 60% have gone in college.
Iraqi oil ministry is concluding contracts with foreign oil companies 10
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government on Saturday ended in two auctions has brought greater oil companies can do to rebuild its damaged infrastructure.
The 10 contracts with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi Ölministeriums suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has paralysed for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies have seen shares in only two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid, has lost out.
Two American companies have been able to conclude contracts for versteigerte fields in June.
The sparsely gesäten representatives of American valued in the opening up of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war and instead of US companies give Asian and European the path, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq.
Security concerns were highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability by the withdrawal of the US military held American oil companies from likely, analysts said to do more in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
U.S. firms because they have to take no account shareholders were disadvantaged in some cases because have competitors, particularly the Chinese, and other state-controlled energy company, significantly lower wage costs and more risks.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum, Inc., was the only American companies that have been able to conclude agreements with the ministry.
Major U.S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and in recent years were with technical advice, started empty.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of this weekend obtained contracts.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered for more contracts than any other companies with large packages and could go to contracts for two major fields home.
We all know, the spokesman of Ölministeriums, Assam to be Jihad that China is on the way, one of the big players of the world economy, as well as a technology makes said.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can compete with its Mitbietern and will fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
For the commandment levy advance elected companies issued commandments, which then pay the fee per barrel of oil were compared, the ministry was ready to increase the output of each Felds above the current level.
Top designers of the Al Qaeda apparently killed in Pakistan
In an apparent US missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan this week is intended to be a top-killed Al Qaeda's operational planners, as representatives of the U.S. terrorism reported on Friday.
This would be if it were to be confirmed, the second deadly attack on a senior leaders of the terrorist organization in this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs that should have been killed, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities representatives of the region by a number of missiles, the Shah on Tuesday her vehicle near the city of Miran in the province of North Waziristan-met.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a Drohnentyp, which has been used by the CIA in the lawless tribal belt of Pakistan.
They drove in a white car in the direction of the Afghan border, when the car was taken to a government representative of a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah said by telephone.
Locals who are alleged to be one of the militants ran to the site and quickly took everything in itself, which was "completely wrecked bodies".
The local authorities, the identity of the victims could not confirm, but two representatives of the US terrorism led to an unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali has been described as the leading military planners of Al Qaeda, the operations of terrorist groups headed outside the region of Afghanistan-Pakistan.
He was involved in plots around the world, a senior official, who wished to remain anonymous, and on the delicate nature of the US air attacks pointed to the Pakistani state said.
If you assume its central role as a given, it also included the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He adopted strategic instructions from the Topführern of Al Qaeda and turned them into operation plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American authorities representative said that Somali had ballooned quickly in the Al Qaeda hierarchy and best compounds used with other extremist groups in the region.
He may be some Americans do not know the second authorities representative said, but this in no way reduces the risk that he represented for us and our allies.
If confirmed his death, Somali would be the second leading Al Qaida or Taliban leader who was killed since September, when Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other Topaktivisten were killed in a similar attack.
The pace of attacks by unmanned air vehicles of the CIA has dropped since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a Web site-operated by a nonprofit organization, from an average of six operations per month on two.
The decline may have taken on improved tactics of terror groups are based, the steps to reduce their vulnerability and kill while at the same time, on suspected informants, the site reported.
Senior UN envoy in Kabul will resign
The senior UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, leaving a stormy tenure was over, marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
Oath draws redundancy, as the Obama's decision to send 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed his concerns about the fact that the US timetable for the military withdrawal, which is expected to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw its forces.
We need to speed the development of Afghan security forces and will send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust of the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
This commitment must be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to help with the political conversion of Afghanistan.
The troop increase on the military side must reflect an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he never quits, but only one in March 2008 to fulfil his family agreement to remain just two years in Kabul.
He said that he wanted the notification of UN
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon pass now so that they have time to arrange for a replacement.
What I said that it is better to seek a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, it was a zweimonatiges vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban-representatives in accordance with UN has started the search for a replacement.
The UN representative said that he has learned the Swedish-Italian-@-@ descended Staffan di Mistura, who has recently directed the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno ’, who conducted before UN peacekeeping operations.
Oath draws position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September to favor President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to cover up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has denied all accusations, but he also said that the allegations of Galbraith, who was fired - "the mission have undoubtedly caused damage, because a great deal of scepticism was on the international interference in the election".
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the aid measures of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also entered the UN's top leadership allows his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries who donate to the Afghan mission, and said that it would strengthen their confidence that their money is used properly.
Eide voiced his disappointment about the restriction of its forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN-recruitment schemes have undermined his opportunities in airports capable people.
The UN rules are such that I since May, he said, only one person was able to stop.
This is disastrous and cannot continue.
U.S. Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must reckon with additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will impose soon "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, because he has not in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a seven-day tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq and played the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, no good options are on the ballot, he said in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that are on the soul, is, if we have learned in the past six years, anything from Iraq, the war own Unvorhersagbarkeit."
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package, aimed at the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians.
He said that a "package of incentives and disincentives" is necessary "in order to convince the Iranian government that it is protected with nuclear weapons, in reality, less" because their people "will suffer terribly" from the sanctions.
On Friday has joined in a statement from the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the American government, the top European politicians in the warning that Iran must count on "credible" consequences if he with his nuclear program than the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear-monitoring organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency, fulfils.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should only be won for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said that he would begin talks to curb its nuclear program, and in a substantial part of its stores stock of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for would abandon its medical research reactor.
The US government has pressed for this type of agreement to build trust between the two parties and to win time for negotiations.
Iran appears to leave but since that time, the negotiations on the preliminary agreement -- in part, experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether they should commit to the United States.
Iran has let the international community with regard to some of the proposals, which it had already agreed at the beginning of October, simply stand has, frankly, the international community, together with the Russians and the Chinese, in a way, as they did in conjunction with important additional sanctions on Iran were never, Gates said.
President Obama has set the 31 Dez. as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he will be other options to pursue, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "crippling sanctions".
In a statement issued in New York has condemned the Iranian representative at the United Nations, which it on Thursday, "gratuitous and unfundierte allegations" of some Security Council members called on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to reach an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who should return last Friday to Washington, met in the morning with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying in the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers with Kurdish authorities in Kirkuk and representatives in Irbil.
The tension between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, in particular concerning borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent delays of US plans to reduce the American troop strength by the end of August by 115 000 at 50,000.
Gates also sought to dispel the Kurdish concerns about the impending withdrawal. U.S. Representative Gates, who said to Masood Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, quoted: "We are your security, your well-being and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
A change of course in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that kept them lectures that Mother Earth "is too tired to talk about other children" and "A baby more means a grave more."
These lessons have you learned so well that ermunterten, as government officials in Shanghai, through the low birth rate and ageing population began appearing in this summer suddenly, to change course and young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and definitive: "Under no circumstances".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child is left with nothing, Wang said, 31, a staff leader with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously dicklichen, spoiled Einzelkindern who are affectionately "little emperors", rolls a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 at the time, as this policy came into force, the UN is
Department of population issues, while the number of the population 60 years and older is expected to rise by 2020 from 16.7 percent of the population by the year 2050 31,1 percent on soaring. This is much higher than the global average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is in rich coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai, stronger.
Last year have identified 60-year-old children and elderly almost 22 percent of reported residents Shanghais, while the birth rate has been under one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, the head of the Shanghai city population and family planning practice has said that couples get normal reproductive age babies to reduce "to help the relationship of the ageing population shares and alleviate a workforce shortage in the future".
Shanghai will soon "as old -- but not so rich -- as the developed countries, such as Japan and Sweden, have," she said.
A gradual easing
Enshrined in the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy, arguably the most controversial injunction, which was introduced by the ruling Communist Party until today.
Couples who are against this policy, must reckon with huge fines -- triple up on her annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese state representatives have attributed this policy that the critical financial pressure on the natural land resources could be avoided, while human rights activists have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have abzutreiben pregnant women who have already had a child, forced to.
Moreover, many couples had to carry out sex-selective abortions, which has created an unnatural ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government officials have toned down for population gradually their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban dwellers and members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been Einzelkinder -- and 2007 was moderated by the tone of many hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing said that government officials have discussed recently even more radical changes to allow, for example, two children, couples in which one partner is Einzelkind.
Shanghai was in July for the first Chinese city, which has launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters, the family belehrten to have only one child, were replaced almost overnight by directives that will describe in detail, who questioned for a second child and how to apply for the permit.
The city government has municipal employees and volunteers for family planning sent to couples at home to visit and information sheets under the doors by passing.
They also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for the available that have more than one child.
The response was not particularly encouraging, family planning officials said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials said from a rural town in external areas of Shanghai that a recovery is to identify with the requests from couples who want to after the start of the campaign for a second child, the urban districts against report no change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115 000 only four to five requests as an example still per month.
Disheartened Shanghai officials say that the 2010 expected number of births in the city will be despite the campaign still around 165.000 -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of family planning committee of the Shanghai municipal Caolu, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people no longer want to have children.
They want to give her first best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juan Juan, 26, said that they would like to have had two children and allows it legally.
But they have, how many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance from the government.
Without a social network, you say that this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West to assess the one-child policy wrongly as a human rights issue, Yang, a structural engineering, whose wife seven months pregnant with her first child is said.
Indeed, it is robbing us the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples to provide psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the chief of staff, said that they would like to only one child, because she was also a Einzelkind. "We were the focus of the family and used that anyone cared about us.
We are not accustomed to care for others and do not want to do this. "
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old, a translation company belongs, it said more outspoken.
For parents from the middle class with Doppelkarriere drops, through which the birth rate, he said, it is hard to be a success and for that you have to be selfish.
Today, the age group of 20 to 39-year-old grew up in order to see their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they like a life not for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, makes huge demands on the time for parents.
A mother has to give up their social life for at least two years.
Then there is reconstructing the space question -- "Man to his home" -- and the lives of planning have -- "If the child is 9 months old, has already been a CV for the best nursery classes of Europe."
Most of his friends are ready for this one time, Chen, but not twice said.
Our generation is the first to have achieved a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to get too many victims.
UN group is drafting plan for reducing emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which until now by wild postures and mutual recrimination characterised -- has set on Friday with the publication of a document back a focal point of the recording for the next 40 years an ambitious cuts in greenhouse gases, with the industrialized nations in the near future would have to shoulder the main burden.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has experienced both the remaining obstacles, as also shown the way forward.
But he was seen as a major step forward in a negotiation, which comes the time when next week arrive more than 100 leaders from around the world in Copenhagen.
The text, which was created by a special United Nations working group was established, says nothing about the amount of money from the rich countries to poor countries should be to ensure that these short- and long-term global warming can master.
He would also offer a range of options for the key questions, including how developed and major emerging countries limit their carbon emissions and support what should be the upper limit of the global rise in temperature, the political decision-makers.
The process will be awarded a great flexibility, as John Coequyt, a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has drafted a six-page document, summed up a 180-page negotiating text to put it at the heart of what the leading representatives of the UN climate change, Yvo de Boer described as "the big picture".
He would show the outline of a possible agreement, in which the industrialised nations would join their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent lower compared with 1990 levels, while major developing countries to cut their emissions in the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 2050, about 50 to 95 percent.
The European Community has the talks on Friday also given a boost by their promise to allocate over the next three years, 3.6 billion dollars per year to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from the masters of the floods and droughts until the avoidance of deforestation.
Friday nonetheless expressed the same verbal fire stations, which had driven the talks in the past week.
The U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern rejected wordings binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, demand, if they are not funded by the industrialised nations.
This train announced that the Obama Administration drive a harder line with China, as a representative of the Bush government-less than two years ago.
The United States will sign an agreement without major emerging countries could stand up and take action, so Stern, who also sued over that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts also confirmed by outsiders.
Stern issued its opinion one hour after the declaration of the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, which meant that it feels the leading US climate negotiator either of "common sense" or "highly irresponsible" of him was that he said earlier this week that the United States, China would not help financially to tackle global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of major world powers is at stake, have opened up both within the industrial nations, as well as between the industrialized nations and emerging economies fault lines.
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to save the planet, with China and the United States claim to fight amongst ourselves up for their respective commitments, while poorer countries that the two dozen influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers should fight about who will bear the cost of the Bremsung of greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have begun to act more aggressively to bring those countries with very high greenhouse gas tax to account for their actions.
This is clearly a game, suggesting a new economic dominance will develop, so Ulate, who is also a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that suffer the worst impacts of climate change, said that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants said that the talks will lead in the best-case into a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members presented on early Friday morning, a 24-page draft Treaty.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of small island States exercises "political pressure on the overall political process," partly because they are now united and measures of emerging countries, such as China and India are calling.
The talks got a new urgency, as the delegates have focused on the fact that most outstanding issues still need before the arrival of the government leaders are resolved to reach an agreement.
Senior representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice Minister entstiegen their aircraft and chart almost through the corridors of Bella centres of meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, existing nutritional order, which will be under negotiation during the next week.
The sheer scale of the assembly -- more than 13,000 people run daily in Congress Centre and from, gitarrespielende activists will stage late-night shows in which she makes mock the funny countries -- betray their opinion and sell, and draft Treaty passed from hand to hand, rather than by e-mail has been a challenge.
The intensity builds just: Almost all important ministers are here and now as of Wednesday 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to the Upper League, Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of the organisation, Conservation International said.
The heavyweights.
Britain's first 225 km / h speed train defines the Monday feeling newly
Monday tomorrow at 5 p.m. 13 will penetrate a pipe the darkness to announce a journey admitted that a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first Hochgeschwindigkeitspendlerzug will travel the country with his lightning trip from Ashfort, Kent, to London St Pancras reach 225 km / h and 93 km in 38 minutes.
With Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, Dame Kelly Holmes will then go on board the first Javelin-commuter services from London.
He hopes that the new service ankoppeln Britain is finally at an international rail network faster and more reliable trains and the major metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland will connect to London.
The neglected province could become viable commuter towns, working hours would ponder radically reduced and the exchange of plane and car on the train would reduce the national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main parties believe in this vision.
But the many billion British pounds for the construction of a new national network, the unavoidable planning battle and concerns about environmental damage could in the British high-speed tracks still consider the brakes.
High-speed Two (HS2), a company based in January, which is due to present to the government a feasibility study, according to the Times, Lord Adonis is the report on 30 December.
In this way, he receives a detailed route map of the next planned phase of the high-speed rail network.
The new rail line connecting London with the West Midlands, will pass with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places where the effects on the environment are controversial.
The free site of the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final stretch.
HS2 also to produce three options for a wider, taller northwards high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will react in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a Y-shaped route, would result in which a single high-speed link in the West Midlands.
The route would share in or near Birmingham and a Abzweig would lead to the west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in the direction of North East after Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the most viable option," a rail-insider said.
After the completion of the journey time between London and Edinburgh would reduce to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part of the track that cannot be opened before 2025, it would allow the travellers, the London-Birmingham stretch in 49 minutes, compared with today, just over an hour to traverse.
The draft guidelines would be offering the opportunity to travel at a speed of 400 km / h, increasing the British rail network, the quickest of Europe.
The initial route has been designed in a way that 400 metres long trains can travel with a maximum capacity of 1.100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour-Birmingham could be behind London in operation.
This in turn would mean that a terminus in London could be would be needed, checking on the 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the space limitations in the capital would be expected to an existing station will be built to house the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will be known whether this plan should be continued his opinion, or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion that the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from the high-speed lines on existing rail routes in the north of Birmingham, making the journey times between London and Scotland remain in about three hours.
This is seen as a key sticking point, so that a switch from air to rail can be guaranteed a beacon for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers for £75,000 for mortgage at a Conservative-Orangerie
Alan Duncan, the senior Conservative member of the Commons, has asked the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of a Orangerie in accounting, he took it building up in his house in his constituency.
The prison spokesman for the party, which was downgraded by David Cameron because he complained that House of Commons members' of lean Rationen must "live, has increased its mortgage at 75,000 pounds to build a Eichenholz-skilled factory farming on his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to ask the taxpayer to pay the additional interest in accounting, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The leaders of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time, and they were not can also question asked by Sir Thomas Legg, who is carrying out a review of the expenses of Members of the House of Commons. Last night said Duncan that the proposals would have "not even cleaner or more comprehensible."
Duncan, one of the richest among House members, zweistöckiges owns a house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Near the houses have reached a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, residential and Esszimmer, but the fees office that the spending control of the House of Commons, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he has cultivated a winter garden, described the plans as "Orangerie."
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment."
Duncan was not even during a recent examination of his previous mortgage contracts by the committee on standards and privileges invited to comment on the increased money opening position.
The committee has acquitted him last month for an investigation into his spending by the breach of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan the security transfer for a mortgage on 271.406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house on his constituency home, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election to the Member of Parliament.
This week published documents show that Duncan had until March last year around 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month in mortgage interest-reimbursed.
In April his claims rose to more than 1 800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncans RBS-mortgage during this time has not changed, which suggests that the overall increase in funding the money host served by 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal levels unemployed RBS-mortgage interest rate dropped from 7,94% in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where he is still standing.
The latest from the House of Commons published documents show that Duncan made in this May continue to be entitled to 1.250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month.
Duncan lost his job in September as the opposition leader of the House of Commons, after a Undercover-reporter filming him when he said after the expenses scandal that MPs "of lean Rationen would" live.
"Basically, if it works for the state that it must live on lean Rationen and how does S * * * * * e treated."
He said: "I have spent my money for my garden and what is entitled to make a tiny part, measured by the.

Johnny Hallyday was enabled by the doctors of the hospital Cedars-Sinaï in Los Angeles in an artificial coma, in which he was hospitalised on Monday because of a bacterial infection after a succession Bandscheibenoperation on 26 November in Paris.
The singer has undergone in the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of the, through the last intervention created unhealthy changes again an operation.
His wife Laeticia attended on Friday morning in a Schulveranstaltung in the French High School of Los Angeles, in which their daughter Jade goes to school, said a photographer of the AFP.
The head of the department for terms and traumatologische surgery at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, would have been aware that he visit the singer on Monday in hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer has burdened the Neurochirurgen Dr Stéphane Delajoux, who has the singer on 26 November operates in the Clinique international du Parc Monceau in Paris, difficult.
They told us that he had done the purest massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said that they were totally outraged Mr Camus said.
I have heard that you will probably start a trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "far too quickly and so with the permission of the Paris surgeons travelled to Los Angeles."
I spoke on the telephone with this doctor personally, who assured me that he sees the visit as an entirely unproblematic, what has surprised me very much because I have even been two Bandscheibenoperationen behind me, he added.
Shortly before he went known for RTL that the singer had apparently after the operation "without Drainage without leaving Everything" the hospital.
DR Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artist environment.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at this time.
In 2007, he had operated on as the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorbieren a Hämatom after a Gehirnblutung.
But he is also a doctor with dubious reputation, which was several times because unsuccessful operations and not forgetting, convicted for Steuerhinterzug and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the doctors' association, described him as "a man without scruples", which has to answer "regularly" before the chamber board and "anything but commendable".
After a few days of silence Dr Stéphane Delajoux issued on Friday by his lawyer, David Koubbi Me, a statement.
He said that the intervention would be "perfect run" and the post-operative investigations were "normal".
The operation "caused no bleeding and therefore requires no Drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of Sängers, whose health problems since äufen letzem summer seems called into question.
It is quite clear that it is for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens) a little too tight, Mr Camus said.
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) will vigorously and the party Nouveau Centre invites to use no longer their mark
The alliance is being monitored by François Bayrou ’ s party modem, has to use on Friday on a takeover attempt by the label, once of Valéry Giscard d ’ Estaing positioned, from the chairman of the party's Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, reacted sharply and asked him under threat of prosecution, this marks on any document added.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over the UDF Siegel, because he is of the opinion that François Bayrou would not be worthy of this political legacy to defend after he would have done the left hand.
The defence minister, whose party partner of the UMP is, incidentally, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC).
On the strength of his efforts he had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette ehemalig (UMP), now in NC), which collects a claim on the property of the trademark UDF, since he was first applied for this brand of 2004 when "Institute National de la propriété industrial".
However, the secretariat of the fallow by François Bayrou's friends oversaw the silence UDF alliance of parties and that they were not expropriate itself has stated clearly and pressured the minister and the Member under threat of prosecution a deadline to use this mark no longer and transfer their property rights to the brand.
They have made in the past few days, numerous statements that you would suggest your political movement, the UDF Siegelzu assume + +, the party alliance wrote in one, from 19 of 24 office members signed the letter, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the party modem and the Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
They also believed to be possible you would have the right to the name of this movement + Nouveau centre +, the slogans + today's UDF +, on their political material, as well as the starting side of your website.
As you know, you have no right to the use of this mark, the secretariat said the UDF and the Party NC) asks, "the mention of the name of sämtlichem UDF immediately to remove material and of (their) website."
Moreover, one of Mr Hervé de Charette demanded "to transfer the property rights of the brand of their legal right to qualify."
If you deny it, we will collect an action against you to give the law respect and defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, the undersigned warned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF" since 1978 is a fully-fledged political movement and recall that Morin and his friends "the election have made" to leave them in 2007 to start a competing movement, as it had already taken other 2002 to start the party "UMP."
The Party has therefore Nouveau centre, the undersigned, no rights to use the UDF Siegel (Union pour la française Interior).
They continue to point out that the last congress of the UDF 2007 passed the three-year membership of the party modem and the establishment of a business centre in defence "of material and moral interests" of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing formed movement.
What Mr Hervé de Charette, the secretariat is continuing, "he was at the time, as he has requested the brand name, for three years is no longer a member of the UDF" but the UMP.
He benefited on scandalous and fraudulent manner, from the absence of the deposit of Akronyms UDF to carry out this for himself.
You also have to remember that this is recklessness on the best ways to turn into a criminal offence, and ironisieren the strategy of the NC): "It seems to us, but in politics as in life would be full to make a name for themselves, instead of trying to come out of anonymity, by they appropriate, of a name that has no legal rights."
Affair Liliane beds Court: François-Marie Banier is convicted for exploitation of weakness
The Court of Nanterre decided on Friday, the artist François-Marie Banier has assessed to determine whether he, as the daughter of Milliardärin Liliane beds Court claims exploited a weak moment of 80-year-old, being cheated out of a portion of their assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his celebrity photos, will have on 15 and 16 April 2010 answer for exploitation of weakness in court, a crime that is punishable by a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of EUR 375.000.
This decision means that it will really make a process in this affair, which is one of the richest families of the saga worthy of France, in the mother and daughter fetzen itself and at the same time, the reins of L'Oréal cosmetics empire in the hand.
Equally, however, the 15th Supreme Court ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane beds Court, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and Hauptaktionärin of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially among, during the investigation of the public prosecutor of Nanterre's conditions.
The Friday-appointed doctors are still present before 10 March 2010, a report in which you make clear whether, and at what times Liliane beds Court may have been in a state of weakness.
I think they will be subject to these investigations.
I will talk with her, the prosecutor of Mrs beds Court, Me Georges Kiejman said after the hearing.
With regard to the lawyer of Françoise beds Court-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is with the decision of the Court very satisfied.
This is excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he has manipulated (Banier) this old lady who needs to be protected, he confirmed.
For the past two years, the only daughter of Liliane beds Court has launched a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and Allroundkünstler, and accused him to exploit the weakness of their mother for years, with grants being cheated out of a total of EUR 1 billion in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For its part Liliane beds Court had always refuted, to have been manipulated by the photographers, which it views as a longtime friend.
Although the court would have to assess the admissibility of Mrs beds Court-Meyers initiated legal action, the Plaidoyers of lawyers on Friday led to a large family debacle.
So the prosecutor of Liliane beds court has appointed on three of his Klientin at their notary, sent letters (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she distrusted the husband of Françoise beds Court-Meyers.
According to her lawyer Liliane beds Court added: "Could you please explain to my daughter that I fifteen years have long, once written by twice a day to Banier.
Françoise I was able to talk since their marriage never again. "
The public prosecutor of Nanterre is once again respond to the view that the plaintiff, had no right, as primarily a guardianship judge has, in recent days because rejected their request to open a judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane beds Court "is fully capable of law, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act on her behalf, "the representative of the prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney confirmed.
The court has now decided to deliver a verdict after the trial has taken place on the admissibility of Mme beds Court-Meyers.
Manager-revolution or the end of the Strategic early detection?
If nothing will change at the leaders of the big French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence have been for nothing...
Since the position of the company vis-à-vis join over a decade, the attitude of the management of major companies said in relation to his staff, consumers from the marketing revolution: It is for staff "values" determines the best, as it was previously designed to impose on the consumer-products of the technicians in the station.
By the customer at the heart of the company's marketing revolution has been to impose the strategies of the conquest of the markets on the ground... although separated the authoritarian temptation produce factors preferences of customers regularly again!
A demobilisation of staff can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects in particular the employees.
These demobilization is having a negative effect on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, especially to those of F Eund, what is even more crucial &, on those of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IU (Intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "by all interested parties (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision urges"; she claims a commitment from the staff, the instructions from the authoritarian management contradict altogether.
Therefore, we would ask for an occupational revolution, which consist of the staff denMittelpunkt in putting the concerns of the company on an equal footing with the customers.
The very-related benefits of internal polls
The internal polls, as the questionnaire submitted the orange his pay recipients to encourage this revolution in relation to the management practice?
I fear that, unfortunately, not.
- First, because I could see that the whole fabric with a new situation after many domains cover finally about to do the priority... what it has always done.
Partly because of authoritarianism - one of the pathology of power in proportion to the importance of his own failures is increasing.
And finally, because most managers have a much simpler idea of human behavior.
Born of the great engineering schools their interpretation is the psychology mechanistic.
They assume intellectual comfort through the old behavioristische theory that was recently reactivated by the US "neuroscience" and unwittingly spread wide-ranging from research institutes and through the media.
Thus, it suggests that it is possible to operate the "leverage" (sic) on the involvement of employees, a aktuellein Le Figaro.fr appeared poll by ipsos executives confirmed in a position to a mechanistic control system, which is unsuitable for today's world.
The mobilisation factors identify and measure
Instead, one for the smooth operation of the modern business necessary operational revolution requires the approval of a permanent view of human behavior.
It is to integrate into any thought or practice of steering a fundamental record: For wage earners is the commitment to the company will only be possible if it seems clear as a means to achieve a portion of their dreams, their ambition and their projects.
Currently, only take the studies from the multifunctional analysis of this conception of the motivation of staff.
These studies have shown that they judge their companies on the basis of a scheduled Doxa that allows them to estimate by their wahrgenommenes picture of the company, as it offers them in achieving their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of this mobilisation factors the executives of the company can control their "social performance," predict and anticipate and place their human resource management back to the right place.
So they create a fertile ground for the harmonious development of a robust and effective economic intelligence favourable.
Speaking from Oslo, the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right one
The American rights on Friday welcomed by Barack Obama on the eve speech in Oslo, and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had mocked the awarding of the prize to Obama on 9 October, applauded this time of the speech by the president, the example of the former Vizepräsidentschafts-candidate in the elections of 2008 following Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said that Palin, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party said in the newspaper USA Today and added that it had set itself the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in its newly published memoirs.
The war, of course, is the last person I think that Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has worked on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force; a way to explain his Entscheidungvon nine days to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, took the view that the Präsdent have done in Oslo 'very good work ".
I found that the speech was really very good frohlockte former Speaker of the House of Representatives, particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world," in the words of Obama's acknowledged.
In some parts of this speech habeich felt quite as historic, Ginrich, who was questioned in the radio programme "The take away," said.
The previous Member who is seen by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said he would be delighted to see a "president of the left," which reminded members of the Nobel Committee, that they were "not free and not a prize for peace could hand when the use of force does not exist".
For Michael Gerson, a former recorder of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has "a very American speech".
In addition, is that it represents itself as "Kosmopolit", as he makes "it over," he had "spoken as an American president," when he pointed out that the Europeans live "as in a security bubble that created them and protect them, for they do not much," Gerson.
Among the few, not persuaded rights of former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a hawk in the Bush era, the speech on the website of the National Review Online described as "boring, pompously happening and inspiration".
On the left wing of the president of the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is worried about how Barack Obama defended the recourse to the armed forces.
The war is packaged under the guise of the judiciary to justify the massacre of the innocents, quite simply, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, remains a commended at the side of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still of the view that the Nobel prize was awarded prematurely to Obama, described the address even for a speaker like him, who is known for his talent as a "Monumentalwerk."
Speaking in Oslo "offers a running plan for the management of international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," enthusiastically as the California newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama proclaimed "the necessary discourse" and described his speech as "bleak and exemplary at the same time".
Long-distance drivers: Three Marathons for an agreement that ensures the supply at Christmas
After three weeks of negotiating marathon the unions of road Association and the TLF arrived - the only employer organization that stayed until the end - on Friday evening to an agreement that sets the strike order and the threat of severe supply crunch at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, "the responsible for the transport minister Dominique Bussereau welcomed" the agreement that was launched on Wednesday morning, after several weeks of negotiation.
After a second night of negotiations the Verhandelnden on early Friday morning began to crumble in the hope to sign the agreement later this morning quickly.
Despite the fact that the three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra OTRE upset) and had to leave the meeting.
However, it has taken more than six hours from the start of the meeting at 11: 00 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and only about 18: 00 p.m. the agreement was signed.
The conflict "would have the company very much harm would be inflicted" and it was "to fear that it would hurt the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and by 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
Of the hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages so instead of EUR 8,72 9,06 euros.
"That is not very much but once we start small," Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now instructed to block the supply centers.
"There will be increasingly likely, however, some recalcitrant who are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
The TLF-Chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "difficult to give these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is up to 170 euros a month for the low and with 100 to 120 euros for the high wages.
"This agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the employees," maxim Dumont) (CFDT, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of a "historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke on this point about "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for an increase in the cost of travel by 3% and the upholding of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010 that will enable it, in particular, to address the issue of 13th month salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that the drop in taxes on employers to the tune of 100 million euros, "the subject of an amendment was" the government on the bill of the corrected finances for 2009, which was adopted on Thursday night on Friday by the National Assembly.
The government calls "an identical" vote by the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows that the agreement will apply for the first of this organisation affiliated companies, and that it is then in the event of an extension through the labour minister for the entire profession.
This is "in no time" of the case, assured Bussereau.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the process.
The federation FNTR has denounced a "fraudulent trading", because the 100 million euro "had been promised the sector to offset some of the carbon tax already."
The secretary of state for transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but to verdrießen about the bird-Esser in the approaching Christmas days, the Unostra laments.
For the association Otre threatens the agreement "small and medium-sized companies in the sector to schaufeln over the next 12 months, a major grave".
Line RER A: Disruption this weekend, unions with the proposals of the RATP dissatisfied
The disruption on the line RER A, the largest fast rail network in France for the Greater Paris and the Île-de-France, continued at the weekend, while) waiting for a meeting on Friday, the second day of the strike between the unions and the management of the RATP Paris (Independent passenger transport management, the strikers, with their demands for wage increments.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas, no trains were running between 10: 00-20: 00 p.m. on the Central line (between la Défense district and nation) was one of only two trains and outside the central route, only one in four trains a day.
The end of the guidelines of the SNCF was suspended in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced passengers on other flights.
The department store chain Galeries Lafayette in the eye, which counts each day 200,000 customers, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to annex the big business traffic technically".
The line runs through the RER A Paris metropolitan area of West to the East.
The section of the RATP combines the places of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre and Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-la-:.
On Friday, about a planned wrong of two trains on the main transport time, and almost none during the transport poor time.
As on Thursday, there were no Menschengewühl on the platforms, as the residents of the Île-de-France had prepared for the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less run over than usual, mainly because of the lack of secondary school pupils.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (after Val-de-Marne) Jack Nbakina declared that stood engineer (29), before he would be extra "one and a half hours to arrive on time for work."
The SNCF, which had a care of travellers by officials and security forces, pointed out that it had come in Saint-Lazare train station to no bottlenecks.
The SNCF on the line by the RER A or direction from Cergy-Le-skin-powered trains arrived and drove through the station, Saint-Lazare, to ensure there in the wake of the Metros.
On Saturday and Sunday general meetings of the strikers were held again, while the results were checked, who had found the bodies after the meeting with the leaders on Friday afternoon as "pathetic".
The RER-business leaders proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line on all relevant aspects, working hours, professional careers, etc.
However, that is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud) they call for a long overdue pay award.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP even their pay award proposals in brackets, and stressed that the leadership "does not know how to resolve a problem during the long-distance lorry drivers and the SNCF but also was possible."
The RATP made clear that a new meeting is planned for "comprehensive examination of working conditions" on Monday.
This shows the associations also that the company ignored "the Wochenendfahrer."
On the morning around 150 drivers on sought the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Once again it was the leadership that rejected to date, any discussion during the strike, and a meeting encouraged after a lull.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened, auzuweiten itself after a notice of Unsa Indépendants and on the RER B line.
The unions are calling for a pay award of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which EUR 30 variable-( CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they lament the deterioration in the working conditions on this route, on a day millions of travellers are travelling.

Turkish constitutional court resolves pro-Kurdish party on. Decision with serious consequences
The country's Constitutional Court on Friday announced the dissolution of the pro-Kurdish main party in the country; a decision on the immediate angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in south-east of the country and in Istanbul followed.
This decision threatens to complicate the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community, to bring the 25-year-long conflict to an end.
The "party in a democratic society" (DTP) was dissolved, because they had become a "site for activities for the independence of the state and its indivisible unity detrimental," the president of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kiliç the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes would have been needed to impose the dissolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the leadership of the party, including the chairman Ahmet Türk and the parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, for five years excluded from the political scene.
Furthermore, the judge announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity, the Türk Tugluk and enjoy, and the seizure of assets of the party.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (from 550).
The party leader said before the verdict that MEPs would leave Parliament rather than to meet as party unemployed parliamentarians.
The decision followed a in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish federal court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya operational procedures, and he accused the DTP to follow the "instructions" the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is seen by Ankara and numerous other countries as a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party is assured, "to have no link" on the PKK, but refuses to describe this as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court funkt in between the government, which is keen to accommodate the Kurdish community and to propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of Kurds, so don't support the PKK by the Kurds and to put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a break-up could become a re-eruption of tension in south-eastern Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan had conducted in recent weeks in clashes with the police.
Since the announcement of the Court of thousands of protesters gathered in front of the premises of the DTP millions in the city of Diyarbakir in south-east, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
The security forces used tear gas grenades and Wasserwerfer one, when the protesters began throwing Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also marched in Istanbul.
After the verdict Türk assumed that the decision of the Court will "deepen the despair further".
"Turkey cannot resolve this (Kurdish, Anm. that editorial) question on the basis of the ban of a party," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, regretted the decision too.
"We oppose in principle against the closure of the parties.
That does not solve the problems, "Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a quashing the democratic opening, which was promoted by the government," the political market observers Ahmet island.
"You can reckon obviously on a reaction of the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK is known for an attack in which three days earlier, seven soldiers were killed in the north of the country, and this was one of the most brutal attacks of recent months.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years, it was seen as a secret city for Western visitors inaccessible.
Selenograd, one in ten districts of the capital, Moscow, was in the Soviet Union, a strict bewachter location for secret defence research.
Today, the community with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 miles from the Moscow Centre away, as "Russian Silicon Valley".
Considerable research and production facilities for micro and nano electronics lie here.
Since September 2008 Selenograds representatives had been developing contacts to Frankfurt science location Riedberg - with the Uniinstituten) and the firms of Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ.
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday and now Selenograd Riedberg in Frankfurt signed a "protocol to closer cooperation."
The Moscow Vice-Mayor Yuri Smirnov Rosljak and Anatoly Prefect of Selenograd led the Russian delegation that signed for Frankfurt Planungsdezernent Edwin Schwarz.
2010 will be representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the science Foschungsschwerpunkts travel for a seminar after Selenograd.
Exchange of scientific
It is a continuous scientific exchanges.
But it is also about economic relations.
The FIZ firms will be allowed to take on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science firms want to receive orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
For example, the Moscow Institute for Elektronentechnik belong to the big corporations and Sitronics Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plan city" for the defence research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "green city") got its name from the forested hills landscape, in which the research institutes are embedded.
In Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 will not even set high enough.
For the supporters of the project is simply "the new heart of Europe".
Rightly so. S21 is much more than the deeper place of a railway station, more than a monströses construction projects that will plunge the City of Baden-Württemberg Land capital for a decade in utter chaos construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of the 1980's.
Head stations with tracks, which ends in the middle of the city, was seen at the time as transport technical fossils of the 19th century, who appeared as Bremsklötze of a modern rail transport, since it took umzuspannen once a huge amount of time, locomotives from the back to the front.
Harvest, keep briefly to go further - so ´ s should go.
And that is why the head stations should disappear: In Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: A transit station, which lies about half-way through the trans-European rail-main route between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - so the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is being tackled now, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realised that it is in the results and the Bavarian city nearly unaffordable to implement the deeper place.
Head stations have also, however, no entry and exit problem anymore, since there are modern turning trains with locomotives and tax cars at both ends.
Still, Stuttgart 21, beyond the ICE-building after Ulm section is being addressed.
Regional and local politicians have it enforced.
The train with power, partly because the risks of the largest infrastructure bears-Einzelprojekts the Republic of taxpayers and not the state corporation.
The project is justified Städtebaulich still reasonably.
It creates new urban space - it is thought the computergenerierten graphs of planners - equipped with a lot of green.
For the transport system is rail S21 harmful.
The transit station and the sea expansion are intended for passenger transport, which it attributed - typically 1980s - huge growth.
At that time, there were not the competition from budget airlines.
Modern transport policy, but it must first go to strengthen the freight transport, because the transport by rail is much cleaner than by lorries on the roads.
But the new route is due to intense Steigungen not for freight trains.
Much more serious that S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
Good six billion euros are to be buried in Schwäbischen.
That is the official number.
Experts believe that ten to 15 billion for realistic.
Firmly in the next decade the money to other hubs and Engstellen is missing from the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the Transport Ministry.
One of the most important is the development of good 180-kilometre route through the Rheintal.
Since 1987, is being built on the route in slow motion.
An urgent need to push right here on the Tube would be.
But S21 will act as a brake.
The Rheintalstrecke will become the bottle neck for international freight transport, right in the heart of Europe.
Government is considering judgment on the Airport.
The provincial government has let in Wiesbadener project open, whether they will go against the verdict of the results in administrative tribunal (VGH) a night ban in review.
The CDU / FDP coalition have asked experts to examine the more than 400-page ruling VGH legally, economy minister Mr Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The VGH in Kassel had founded on this day in writing that the country in the event of the construction of the planned north-west runway at Frankfurt airport should regulate the ban on night flights.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., according to the provincial government, is not compatible with the legally necessary protection of the population against noise at night.
The coalition until 4 January must decide whether it goes against the verdict in review.
The opposition criticized the suspension and entered on the representatives of the government to abandon a revision to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD group chief Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel urged CDU and FDP to get back to their pre-election promises on a night ban. Otherwise, it was a "breach."
It is hellishly difficult if you must keep its word, Green chief Tareq al-Wazir, in allusion to the FDP-election slogan "We believe that word said".
Ministers Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel back, the country government try to come with "Rechtsverdreherei and sleight of hand" to their night flights.
A precise legal examination need their time.
The coalition would not operate on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a legally certain Entscheiung, Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
So, as they constitute the opposition, were the testimony of his group on the night ban never.
U.S. banks pay back aid
The troubled US big banks will touch on their government shackles.
The Bank of America has paid back on Wednesday aid from the banking bailout TARP funds amounting to a total of 45 billion dollars (well 30 billion euros) in one fell swoop.
And the Citigroup plans after a report by the US channel CNBC to reimburse the state aid.

The Bank of America had worried about convertible bonds well 19 billion dollars in fresh cash from investors.
The rest of the money they took out of its own coffers, which was filled partly through parts sales well.
Bank CEO Kenneth Lewis said on Wednesday evening to the American taxpayer: The injection have helped through a very difficult time.
The money had verhoben house at the height of the financial crisis with the takeover of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup wants to acquire the liberation from their liabilities towards the State also money in capital markets.

Quick election
It was then, but everything faster than thought.
The ZDF had barely two weeks after-board of the acting editor Nicholas Brender pushed out of office, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the panel wanted to vote on the Personalie.
As a favourite Peter Frey are scoring, head of the ZDF was-main city studios in Berlin.
There was no confirmation from the station, however - officially, in order to anticipate the procedure.
However, a role should not even have played to damage the ZDF-Intendanten Markus Schächter further, this proposal to the board should also not be allowed to get away.
Frey are scoring, Schächters candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 council members.
The result of the vote was not fixed in editorial conclusion of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter was failed with his proposal to extend the contract with Nicholas Brender by another five years on the board.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him and Brenders dismissal was a heavy defeat for Schächter, a erwartbare, however.
Because the Union majority on the board did not confirm signals for weeks before the election to want Brender in office.
Had organised resistance against the editor-in-chief of the hessische Premier Roland Koch.
With the argument, Brender had lost under the news broadcasts of ZDF in ratings, he rejected another term of the highly-regarded Chefredakteurs.
Until shortly before the election result, there were protests, in which the political influence was castigated for the ZDF.
Finally, even 35 Staatsrechtler had interfered in the debate that the action eingeschätzten chefs as unconstitutional.
Nothing came of it.
To the person
Peter Frey are scoring was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, and pedagogy Romanistik.
Afterward, he worked in the South West radio and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey are scoring changed on ZDF, firstly on the "today-Journal."
Subsequent stations: In 1988-1990's personal advisor will Chefredakteurs; 1991 / 92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998, director and presenter of "tomorrow magazine"; to 2001, head of the ZDF-foreign policy; since then, head of the ZDF's main city studios.
The Greens announced after the dismissal Brenders who was elected on Wednesday or by the industries leaf medium magazine for journalists of the year, a constitutional complaint.
Koch's adversary in the Management Board, the Rhineland pfälzische Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF-state contract so that staff proposals of Intendanten cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
An excerpt of party leaders from the supervisory bodies of ZDF also Beck left out, however.
Brenders voraussichtlicher successor Peter Frey are scoring had recommended to the Board with a bold move - when he criticised the body immediately after the dismissal-Brender strongly in favour.
Thanks to this journalistic independence Belegs both Schächter could elect him without loss of face for the post of Chefredakteurs nominate and the management board, with none of the suspicion to lever a partisan office.
In the party arithmetic Frey are scoring already will be included among the left liberals.
Study will entrümpelt
Part of success for the students: After a year of education strikes the Culture Ministers of the countries on Thursday finally drew a: At a meeting of Kultusminister- Hochschulrektorenkonferenz and both sides agreed to try to improve conditions in the studies Bachelor and master.
The students should be able to complete their studies.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the testing burden: Basically every Studienmodul should just yet complete with a single test.
Moreover, the workload of students reviewed and "a realistic and reasonable level 'is to be guaranteed.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of auditing services between universities inside and outside Germany.
The countries undertook to make common structural targets for Bachelor- and Masters more flexible.
Different countries regulations should not give it beyond.
Less tests
Since the start of the student protests in June and Culture Minister Uni-rectors bearing the saying of the better Studierbarkeit in the mouth.
Now, for the first time, it was filled with a specific content.
The so-called accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of trials drastically in part: "Each module usually ends with only one consideration," says in a 30-page document, which is intended to regulate the admission of new courses in part.
With the "sharp reduction in the testing burden chairman of Reinhold Grimm said," the accreditation council-, should be offered a "trend, which endangered the Studierbarkeit significantly."
Moreover, the "Studierbarkeit" in the future, "the critical factor" in the design.
Modules as content are "rigorously checked to see" whether "Einengungen of students in the choice of unnecessary
Events "would be avoided.
The students had "entitled to maintain margins, the own initiative will allow and encourage".
The rules should apply to the approval of new, but also in the review of existing studies.
This must all be five years' reakkreditiert "– meaning that it would take until 2015 before all courses were reviewed.
Responsible for federal far ten accreditation agencies that the accreditation council set up by the countries are subject.
The Culture Minister had urged the countries in October "with vigour", as to the agencies that the material wealth, not too big and not too stringent verification regime.
In individual Länder universities and technical colleges with the country ministries have already agreed to take appropriate measures.
So far as the only country to said in Rhineland-Palatinate for the further development of the Bologna process additional resources.
Of the money for the universities must set up especially Tutorenprogramme and studies advice and strengthen inspection and Auslandsämter.
Country and universities want to spend tens of millions of euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce an amendment of the Hochschulgesetzes into Parliament.
After this is to be the conclusion of a study model only one more test.
The study design would be more flexible, moreover, the recognition of achievement after point is guaranteed to other universities and access to the master be facilitated.
By the end of next year, all courses of the country at their Studierbarkeit should be reviewed.
The government and opposition had argued on Thursday again on the studies conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The federal, state of Juso-Hochschulgruppen called for the organisation of education policy should not be held in the future more "behind closed doors" of ministers and university chancellors.
After the education at the latest strikes the students as a person "a little word should now also have a say."
The support they received the future graduates from the President of the Hochschulrektorenkonferenz (HRK), Margaret winter coat: "We need the experience of the students," said on Thursday in a meeting with the ministers with whom the HRK debated on a common reform paper.
The union education and science (GEW) went the Bonn decisions as a whole does not go far enough: They are demanding a legal right, the more any graduates with a Bachelor-close access to a secondary master degree.
On the other hand, that the current generation of Bachelor stand for-students tomorrow sufficient master studies courses with best available studies conditions, so GEW-board member Andreas cellar must ensure the countries.
The countries must stop far more lecturers.
At a freer access to master the Culture Minister said not, however.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Comment in Germany and from almost no control is beautiful... "is the beginning of a line of Gedichts Lyrikers Werner Söllner where this raised in troubling language shreds the arrival experience of a dissident, who won the freedom but lost both his language area.
The 1951 in the Romanian-born Werner Banat Söllner had worked first as - speaking German and English teachers in Bucharest and later as Lektor in a children's book publishing before he übersiedelte 1982 after Frankfurt.
Söllner has been awarded with various literary prizes, in 1993, he thought the legendary Frankfurt Poetikvorlesungen at the Goethe University, and since 2002, he is head of the Forum in Mousonturm Hessischen literature in Frankfurt.
For considerable extra-literary, he caused a stir last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, when it came to "German literature in Romania in the mirror and their Zerrspiegel Securitateakten."
Visibly confused and transfer Söllner read out a statement in which he declared before Romania German writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his cooperation than IM for the Romanian Securitate.
Together with some of those present Söllner had received in 1989, the German language prize.
The recruitment attempts had begun by stealth, first in 1971.
I am, closed Söllner, "meaning someone who stood up to intimidation attempts by the Securitate not enough."
Is the lyricist Werner Söllner IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize homage to Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule the literary scene and, in particular, the Community of the Romanian-born German authors will be shaken by a case that makes the throes and the cowardice of a recognizable political system, which is based on monitoring and domestic spying.
Werner Söllner is, so far as one can tell after bisherigem knowledge, not just the perpetrators and victims.
In his Securitate-acts IM Walter have played a role, the literary scholar Michael Markel said after the confession Söllners for him, pointing to the positive influence of IM Walter.
He had cheated him out in all for him at the time, difficult points "," Markel.
It was him a moral need to make that point.
Söllners statement was in form and in this audience unexpectedly, quite surprising the commitment of a former dissident and his cooperation is not with the Romanian secret service, however.
Germany has been a cosy reserve for Securitate-spy, Herta Müller had already written in July in the hours after she had read their own acts, 914 pages.
The victims, one must assume, speculation will have known, and in some case arguably of any clear name Sorin, Voicu and even Walter what lay behind the aliases.
Unlike the belated procedures now very safe sighting of the Stasi-files dealing with the legacy of the Securitate-monitoring is still very vague.
A systematic education is obstructed in recent years and been disabled.
One of the Birthler agency founded the National Council for processing the Securitate-files (CNSAS) was not until 1999, the publication of the files, but since then has been rather slow.
Only since 2005, there is a law that regulates the management of the files.
The influence of former Securitate-members in Romania is still very large, restrained after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller an interview in which a former Securitate-head of Temesvar spoke contemptuously about the prize.
They have a climate, after all, they have interrogated them only once.
The infamy of power meant to be here quite blatantly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly Söllner, as so often in relation to issue debt, inevitable questions linked to the case.
Why only now damaged? Who was? The measured response of who will listen to Söllners commitment that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by know rather than drive of blame and shame gives us hope.
On the plant of Genese Herta Müller, who has received a Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation in Champions League situation
It felt as if there were just a smart gekleideter Außendienstler by a very nice Christmas party, at a sporting goods manufacturers had distributed Goodies, as the new VfB-coach Christian Gross rose in the company of an orange plastic bag of Ausrüsters a quarter of an hour after midnight in a leaflet called C-class. ¨
The man with the enormous shaven heads chauffieren left him because of the tourist city.
Otherwise, he would also have themselves can drive - alcohol was not in the game, and luck besoffen before the 55-year-old girl was as little.
It was a pleasant evening, but this morning the work goes on.
Or just right.
In the words of the first three days before Schweizers pledged: "We have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3: 1-success against Unirea Urziceni in Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: It is a brutally tough fight against the descent."
"Much more important task" before stand on Sunday.
It is necessary to repeat in Mainz, the king class performance in the League-daily.
And the perfectly revealed weaknesses again after the rapid three gates by Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (to put an end to 11).
Drew lots to appoint
The eighth finals of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / Rückspiele 9 / 10 + 16 / 17 March) will be chosen by lots as scrutineers in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy at the start of the fulminanten Babbel-successor remained cautiously so.
Not only with the supposed saviours, who had given the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short term self-confidence, dedication and love of the game.
I have received from the players, and should have told them that they look at their strengths, and they have continued to be courageous, souls plumber Gross said that as simple-sounding recipe for success under Therapeut Babbel but had had any effect.
He has sparked a certain magic, Babbel-enthusiast Jens Lehmann admitted that "if a new impetus comes in football, sometimes things that no one would have thought possible to happen."
And Sami Khedira, which has become a violation break after weeks thanks to its dynamic equal to the best players on the field, tried to describe the identified "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh air" and the operation of new superiors, "he is a man who took decisive action and discipline demands.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel it had apparently because, you know.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet out of the woods, warns Sports Board Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs but especially steady work.
As Gross, players and managers hüteten themselves as before, the victory against a spare weakened and completely called on defense of the Romanian guests completely overstated.
They have won even in Glasgow, before the evil awakening was four days later in Leverkusen at 0: 4 come, Khedira admitted in mind.
And sports bureau Horst Heldt reminded that a season aim had been achieved, but another is still a long way off.
We are not yet on the mountain.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory since three months ago was celebrating after not feeling that lay at the events of the weekend that auflebten in the form of a just before the start of the game broadcast television interviews of gate-keepers Jens Lehmann fresh.
There are decisions that other and not the Jens, Heldt Lehmanns countered the harsh criticism.
The accused had shown the Board leadership weakness and decided on the change of coach at pressure pubertierender fans have.
Also that his free day was removed after the Games, Lehmann took as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and Miss favor.
Lehmanns statements were "characterised by pure self-interest," Heldt keilte back and announced in consequences for the final man.
They will probably no friends for life, the two forty Years.
After all, but they were with all the others agreed that the teaching and vindictive strong idea would not be without the preliminary work by the team trainer abgelöste have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants would have "a big share of the success," said Lehmann Heldt and in unison - and the man with the plastic bag agreed.
The World Cup Fight heavyweight
Hitziges duel in Bern: Keep challenger Kevin Johnson provoked a world champion Vitaly Klitschko in words and gestures.
But after 12 hard rounds of Ukrainians defended his heavy weight-title after version of the WBC.
The judgment of the judges was unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko remains box-world champion in the heavyweight.
The 38-year-old champion after version of the federation WBC) defeated in the night of Saturday in Bern the American Kevin Johnson unanimously after points (120: 108, 120, 108, 119: 109.
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defence after his comeback in October 2008.
Before the Ukrainians was twice world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it has not k.o. with which all expected, turned out well.
Klitschko built from its record on 39 victories in 41 professional fights, he twice had to be beaten on the basis of breaches.
Johnson challenger in the 24 fight suffered the first defeat.
Around 17,000 spectators in the Berne arena of 2,02 metres tall Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight above all leadership with his left hand.
Of the 11 centimetres smaller Johnson, who had announced the duel before the end of the Klitschko-era, but always evade the blows of the champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights into the decisive goal.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried to come only through the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his strikes hit the world champion but only rarely.
After all, it is only the second Boxer after Timo Hoff man in 2000, which went with Klitschko on the full distance of 12 rounds.
The challenger had made before the fight in the Swiss capital for some commotion.
He offended Klitschko as "ugly zombie" that "nothing can right."
The cradles of champion has provoked then on Friday, Johnson solar glasses of the nose to pushing, "in order to be able to see his eyes."
The fourth victory after Klitschkos comeback
Klitschko also remained in his fourth fight after his comeback on 11 October 2008 victory.
After almost four years of leave he had beaten at the time, the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC-belt, which he had previously surrendered without a fight.
This year he defeated then in his Titelverteidigungen Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba in September and Chris Arreola from the United States.
I have received in this fight only a stroke, and am physically very well in form, Klitschko had justified the rapid return to the ring.
His dream remains, but the unification of all four major titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world WBO and IBF champion of the associations.
The WBA belt but the Briton David Haye has, after he was in November the 2,13 meter Nikolai to dethrone Walujew.
Haye had cancelled earlier in the summer of a planned for September fight against Vitaly Klitschko.
Supposedly, whose promotion company has now before the fight against Klitschko Wembleystadion in London.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin, Defense Minister Guttenberg described because of false information to Kunduz affair as a liar.
The Social Democrats and Left demand information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - After the latest findings on the air strike in Kunduz opposition Defense Minister Karl-Theodor Guttenberg ascribed to (CSU) a deliberate deception.
The minister said the fatal bombing at two fuel load trains from September "knowingly the falsehood," Green Group chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the German ARD-news programme "days show said".
This is known as landläufig: He lied.
The order to kill had been granted in defiance of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report, the NATO had Mr Guttenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it became known that covered the attack not only about the destruction of abducted vices, but also to kill two Taliban leaders purposefully.
In the German Kunduz-commander Colonel Klein unsolicited US air attack-inquiry report were killed, according to NATO, or up to 142 people were injured.
Green, the Social Democrats and Left on Saturday called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to comment immediately before the Bundestag and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel will have to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of Afghanistan's policy of the federal government, and, if approved Federal Chancellery, German army and intelligence service this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin demanded and Green Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The Federal Chancellery had not taken concrete operations of the Bundeswehr influence in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday doubts were also become at the portrayal of the Ministry of the background of the dismissal of Generalinspekteur Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert aloud.
According to the Mirror, the two Guttenberg have fully and properly informed about the background of the tank vice-attack.
Officially, it was said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and denied the minister sensitive details.
In the context of the two top officials said, however, that the Ministry of Defence they would have even pointed to several reports, including a two-way document of the command-off Colonel Klein and a field hunters report.
Wichert should by now have asked in a letter for clarification of the facts, reported the "Frankfurt General Sunday newspaper".
He received a reply have not so far, it says.
The ministry has not commented on Saturday on the allegations and pointed out that this in the Committee of Inquiry of the Bundestag will clarify who wants to set up next Wednesday.
Dream worlds apart
Some people see in wachem state images and hearing voices, the others do not see or hear.
Not only in mental health and on the borders between Drogenrausch Imagination and blurring reality.
As long as it happens in the sleep, all is well.
If we lie with closed eyes in our dark rooms, let us be under Unbound the wildest ideas and imagination entities.
Anyone who witnessed in a guard traumartige conditions, things can see and hear, see the others do not or hear applies in the modern Western world mostly as crazy or drug addicts, at least as a Sonderling.
But such images and voices arise not only among mentally ill or in Drogenrausch.
Blame our imagination: The same neuronalen processes that enable us to design houses to paint pictures or to write Romane, sometimes making sure that the boundaries between the dream fantasy and reality.
Traumartig changed awake awareness conditions can occur in a wide variety of forms, in the best case we call them visions, at worst cow.
Although may differ cause and effect, the vision of Mystikerin Hildegard von Bingen can be attributed to the drug experiences of the New-Age-prophet Carlos Castaneda, schamanische Entrückungszustände, psychoses and hallucinations but on similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise if the balance of neuronalen offered substances of the brain is damaged first and foremost dopamine, noradrenalin, serotonin and derailing Acetylcholin - and the interaction of different parts of the brain.
Complex hallucinations and wahnhafte thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic climate.
The hard power has no power over him
The context of madness and dream has occupied philosophers and medics since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of the dream in the eye condition, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, 1861 noted a "great similarity of mistaken one with a dream conditions" for Sigmund Freud was the dream even "a climate, with all the inconsistency, Wahnbildungen, meaning deceit of such".
It is the autumn of 2001 when Henning T. in a comic strip character turns.
His body is developed along two dimensions and quietschbunt.
The hard power has no power more about him, he is hanging in the bedroom ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him devil shape with blood Red, distorted Fratzen few well-known, zähnefletschend.
They hunt him to enter him with serious, inflammatory piece boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain of the whole body.
Noisy, malicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer tolerate it, the voices that attack and insult him.
Henning T. snaps two cable from the stereo, knotet it a noose and strapped her in a hole in the ceiling.
He is rising at a loudspeakers and Takes the noose around his neck.
Jumping one.
The noose solves.
This should be a lesson to you, the voices shout in trommelfellzerfetzendem choir, "salary in the clinic and let heal thee!"
Seen today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has six acute psychosis, the last one is 2 years ago, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive-paranoid climate, moreover, he is bi-low, he takes medication to combat depression, mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his disease, for three years, he is married.
In the climate of I have seen worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The images are cruel reality bore
About one percent of the population affected at least once in life with schizophrenia, in psychiatric hospitals, they will be treated as the second most common illness after the depression.
In a climate of acute schizophrenic affected mostly can no longer distinguish between internal and external world, it could result in a state of confusion about which to hallucinations, scale, Beziehungs- or paranoia.
The vote is particularly prevalent - order hearing voices, or comment on dialogisieren.
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person is not important to separate from no longer distinguish, the brain can disturbing signals more Ausfiltern, awareness is awash with impressions.
As the dream opens the climate of the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies, the deeper awareness classes bracket.
The perception is reality in the climate of subjektzentriert, Professor Thomas fox, Upper doctor says the clinic General psychiatry in the Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg.
The Schizophrene finds itself in the middle of it, everything has a directed at him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he will be, just as in a dream, overwhelmed by what has happened and they can make not active.
So often schizophrenic feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality matching them is largely impossible, bore images of cruel reality, excluded awakening.
Once in a lifetime to have experienced a Halluzination
Unlike in the dream, fox, "says but remains the sinnliche and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in the climate, received in principle."
The delusions and hallucinations liable ideas were rooted in the reality of Verfremdung Erlebens will take place in real terms.
Why do our brains proposes exactly freak, researchers is still a mystery.
Exceptional situations in every person can lead that he loses touch with the short-term, says fox.
But not everyone will develop a climate.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but Zwillingsstudien have shown that the genes are not the only determinants.
Researchers assume that minimal brain damage are available for those affected.
We suspect that the neuronale maturation of the brain will be disrupted at an early stage of development, a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explained fox.
But it remains a mystery, as the disruption of neuronalen system is reached, the non-manifestiere also first over many years.
Environmental factors also play a role, stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for a climate of if the table is there.
Also Halluzinogene drugs can trigger psychosis, as they are in the Transmittersystem intervene.
If our brain is overheating
The stupidity is to suffer Psychotiker among their hallucinations and expensive drugs, get rid of it, others from swallow money for drugs to get what that Lübecker psychology professor Erich says castes.
Whether bore images are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant, is often just a matter of the position.
Caste collects for ten years, reports of hallucinations and wore phenomena, last year, he has evaluated its results in the book "The unreal world in our heads".
Hallucinations may belong to the typical side effects of psychoses, but also of astonishing many other diseases.
This includes diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's skull and brain trauma, which owns mental disorders as Border Line or depression often.
Surprisingly, halluziniert under certain conditions, even the brain healthy people.
Hallucinations, so castes, are made up of memory content that would normally be withheld.
They arise when, in which are processed sensory, obstructed on active or too little; if our brain runs hot or even if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can trigger this state like brain damage or a climate.
But also appeal of withdrawal, stress, pain or other mental exceptional circumstances.
Recent studies of were up to a third of the respondents to have experienced at least once in a lifetime Halluzination.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and visited there in high school.
A normal girl, actually.
If it were not for the images and voices.
During the break, it can happen that a schlaksiger boy with long, dark hair addresses it.
When he replies, the classmates to look it surprised - no one else sees or hears these boys.
They do not keep the timid girl for a versponnene Tagträumerin, dreams but Sarah K., it knows it.
She is awake, they can see or hear these boys, just as the girl listens in the bank beside themselves and see.
You can feel his presence even, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, they like the boys.
Am I crazy?, asks them sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other was wearing images are not real, and then disappear again.
At night, the phenomena are mostly frightening
The images are also often wore a burden.
If you are sitting in the class room, they can follow the teaching material sometimes not because the teachers in their eyes and ears just presents a new classmates, while he explained for all other visually and visible on the table mathematical equations.
At night, the phenomena are mostly frightening.
If they wait in their dark room on sleep, which is far too little and far too late, they can often not distinguish whether she is awake or dreams, whether the pictures she sees that Fratzen or the girl arise with the bleeding wounds on average, arms and legs, above its open or closed eyes.
Let me calmly, she shouts to the characters.
Parents and friends of it tells you nothing that would keep mad for them.
Autumn of 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
Last year she has insisted that A-levels and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations have off.
Since they had online contact with the psychologists included castes, she knows that she is not stupid.
Cow is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or under appeal withdrawal is suffering, he is likely to after a time, hallucinations, says caste.
I suspect that the brain is underemployed and then provides itself for its entertainment.
Sarah K., a Einzelkind, had as a little girl fear of other children, they often played alone.
Their hallucinations began when she learned with 13 that the man they call dad, since they can think, is not her leiblicher father.
Since the same brain areas are in visual and audio hallucinations active, including real impressions and sounds process, it is people like Sarah K. difficult to distinguish wore pictures and reality. "Every experience," says caste, "will take place in the brain, the situation is there.
Hallucinations are also sends images to the brain, that is why they work so real. "
Even late-night dream images of digesting caste as a form of Halluzination.
The hallucinations of healthy person do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute climate.
Unlike Schizophrenen mentally healthy are able to recognise their bore images as unreal.
Caste so word advises his patients, the hallucinations as a special ability.
Between dream and Halluzination Grenzzustand
In our world too much bewusstseinszentrierten pathologisiert imaginary experience is often, unfortunately, Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale-says-hospital in Düsseldorf.
A climate is a difficult, painful disease, but it also has positive, Kreatives - madness is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroide experience form, a particular form of traumartig changed awake consciousness.
Oneiroide are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams that keeps the Erlebende for real and he can't distinguish downstream of wakefulness.
Oneiroide awareness of the condition occurs in trauma- or disease-related extreme situations, for example in Polyradikulitis-patients who experience in full awareness of a motor paralysis.
If a person of self- and world loss is threatened by, for example, persistent, total impotence, he has replaced the life-threatening reality through their own imaginary world, the decoupled from reality, Schmidt says-Degenhard.
A kind of Grenzzustand between dream and Halluzination.
Since the management of a situation is not possible in the real world, a world exchange will take place, but the real situation is quoted in the Imagination.
An intensive form of Sinn Foundation and making itself in an intolerable situation which does not allow us people own design capacity, submerged in a vacuum loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the Memory
The devoted art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen Oneiroid-describes his experiences in his book "change of heart" as a bailout of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a heart valves operation, followed by a heart transplant is posted on travel, while his body is condemned in the intensive care unit of Bewegungslosigkeit.
A Claussen appears in a self-created world, strange times and places visited: He saw themselves as bettlägerigen, old man on board a Zugsanatoriums, a robot guard on his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under nobles manufacturing drugs from blood.
Being abducted by a Greeks on the motorcycle in his own country, with his Spitalbett Firnschnee surf in the Alps and hits a Korean Mafioso.
He is completely on the imagined happening, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These internal travel for Claussen differ fundamentally from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
Quite the contrast, I have the memories from mental trips and even after years in secondary details abundantly clear.
Even more and more intense than really retain memories.
The intensity of this Erlebens goes beyond the horizon of our other secular life experience, the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard says.
At the end of the show Oneiroide, psychoses, hallucinations and Drogenrausch how fragile our internal given the external reality in the guards.
Any change of awareness of the condition, say the psychologist caste, "can lead to a Verformung what we call reality."
An experience may well be also enriching.

Burda
Children should take the cottage with 27 years
The new head of publishing house Kallen is an interim solution: In the long run, Hubert Burda wants to give his company in the hands of his two children, he told the Mirror.
The holding is to include in future to 100 percent of the family.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long run, in the hands of its children.
Both children inherit with 27 years and have the will to enter into the company, the 69-year-old girl told the Mirror.
The details we have regulated as a precautionary measure.
The question of whether they are also active in the company, only later.
The question of whether they are in a position to do so.
It is impossible to regale 7 500 staff his children if they are not sufficient.
This is killing the children and the company also.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he withdraws from January by the chief executive, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen on his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has since 1999, board member in Burda.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, the responsibility was with the Treasury for the company assets, and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also for direct marketing, outside pressure and finances.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the Verlages.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serve to "10 to 15 years to bridge," Burda.
The holding in the future should also include 100 percent of the family, Burda said.
With regard to the cases rise and Schickedanz Schaeffler Burda said that family businesses are not in front of the sinking certain: "It was always families who were infected by a capital addiction who have speculated away completely and believed that they could as a truly great player.
My strategy was never.
He had "never had world power dreams," Burda.
I am not as the political Präzeptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to be a player in the world league with "Time ', these shops have become too great.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek äuβerst is limited, a device with which you can read his e-mails, without any possibility of being able to see certain annexes or surf the Internet.
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame when it chose the magazine Time on one of the products of the year.
To see it on the Straβe is unlikely, but the idea itself is still, particularly for young people of interest.
Unlike the Smartphones Peek only costs very little and a very favourable flat rate has, for example, only half of the price of the flat rate of one's iPhone.
After the company has seen the success that it has launched two new devices on the market: One, that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, quite unlike the Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same borders, as his American counterpart, however, has a surprise of Europe.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros per month, roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone around the world, already know what it means to have to give up all the data in order to read his e-mails, once one has ridden roughshod over the land border, or if one is frantically looking for a café with WiFi (or a possible link with Fon).
The idea of the roaming with flat rate is incredibly tempting and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone operators already offer specific contracts and prices for abroad, but in my experience, you need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to read about all the small print.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe remained almost always overlooked.
Auβerhalb of their own country has always been afraid to read his e-mails, and rightly so.
That a small device as FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it has no WiFi / WLAN) to offer this type of tariffs can mean that the telephone providers must slowly, but surely, rethink and begin to consider different ways of how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example, in his prices the downloading of books and further questions is included on the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without snags.
This is a internetfähiges device and you pay for it only once, at the time of purchase, and not every month.
And that is what I expect of a day of FonPeek, a buying opportunity with lifelong Internet access as it offers the Peek already in the US.
And this is not because I want to buy it.
I read my e-mails with the telephone, thank you.
But I expect that, because I believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish colour of Michelle
The yellow Lieblingsfarbe of the American First Lady is without doubt.
Even in the case of the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the USA, she appeared in a dress and a coat of paint and the same colour has elected again to accompany him during his, without doubt, the second most important moment in his life: The award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has on both occasions very similar models worn: Auβer that it was almost the same colour - a bright yellow, green, the dress was composed of three parts - dress, jacket or coat from the same Stoff-, and she was wearing something groβförmig gesticktes or a neck chain.
It even goes so far as that it had the first sight of the impression that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes differ greatly in the Stoffart from which they are manufactured.
At the inauguration, she wore a dress from head and in Oslo of a gemusterten kid.
The accessories were different: The first time green shoes with mid-high paragraphs and the second time, while a änhliches model, but gold paint.
Also, the hair style every time was different: The hair were pathetic on this occasion than Haarkranz, with the previous them openly wore their hair.
75% of working mothers received because of their maternity problems in the Working
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who wish to have children.
To this result from the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women's study "fertility and career comes of women in Spain."
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working women see curtailed their career opportunities in the labour market because of their maternity.
The study is laying that there is very broad differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of work they perform.
Those that do the auβerhalb of the House no other activity, work only part-time or have no fixed contract of employment, more likely to be mothers and have more children.
In contrast, postpone the women with a solid job, particularly in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a fixed appointing their first child on average only 3.7 years after the draw together, a figure that rises to 4.1 years for women with solid job, which took longer to achieve this and have her draw together and the first child realised until much later.
Auβerdem also has the kind of work a groβen influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar says about the fertility readiness ", the CSIC-researcher, Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must, at the age of the women at the time of the marriage and the first child to be taken into account.
According to the survey, the age at the time of the marriage and the first child is even higher, the higher the level of education.
That difference could be found in the women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group were between 35 and 49 years, ever since they have, if only the secondary school education or higher education, on average, each with 25,1 or 32.1 mother for the first time.
Moreover, there are still, depending on their level of education, another difference between the women.
Marry the women with major final conclusion before its first permanent employment and their first child while it turn around the women with a medium or high school, just in a different way and a permanent employment look first and then marry later and have their first child, Delgado notes.

A cowardly aggression
My 70-year-old mother was walking through our city last week in the town of Fuenlabrada, suddenly herliefen as a group of young people between 15 and 18 years alongside their and our dog, our dog is a Mischling that we have taken from the animal sanctuary and weighs just six kilos, and then out of the blue she gave him two Fußtritte and injured so badly missed him.
Our outrage cannot take off in words, because it is incomprehensible to us, where the Spass because there is to be a cheap's aggression against a small and auxiliary lot animal that was clearly stated on the leash.
In the suffocation attack, a woman who was walking got comfortable, as if they wanted to chastise these people as a result of the incident, they feared even for their own lives, because if an insanity after a dog attacked, he will be the same perhaps with a woman, a child and an elderly gentleman or likely to draw even with every top that is weaker than he himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet town quarter at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has geheult all day long.
Of course, we have incurred in a police department nahgelegenen display, however, but we have great doubts whether this will actually get something and prevent any prejudice from the outset, we would just make it clear that the fig criminals were Spaniards.
Our outrage over what has happened has prompted us to report the incident.
We cannot understand what must be in the minds of those young people that they can find a cheap attack on a defenceless animal fun, at an animal which gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect have stayed with the animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial) a campaign to promote the hat use created especially for the younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative was intended to highlight the importance of the hat use closely, because it is ultimately the only protection element in order to prevent the head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment in terms of road safety, "involves far more than that at and production of products with every day more and more secure" and confirmed that they also help with other actions educational and informative nature to reach this objective every day, a step closer.
This new campaign is under way to promote the hat use on the motorcycle, or under the slogan 'left to be not to be ", will distribute posters in a first phase of about 500 motorcycle workshops in order to obtain the best lines spread.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and it is precisely for the reason that they see committed as a manufacturer of tyres for two-rädige cars ever to do so, it must be one of its main objectives and the development of safer products.
The sale of vans is rising again to something
After nearly two years of the car market for small trucks are finally beginning to see light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles, which were approved in November in Spain, represent an increase of 12.6% in 2008, and, even more importantly, they are so that the first increase at all after 22 consecutive months, keep going with decline, gemäβ the manufacturers' association Anfac and the car dealers' association Ganvam's figures.
These good figures are too genieβen groβer but currently only with caution, as the reference data are used for comparison in November 2008, that was a particularly bad Verkausjahr with a decrease of 60% on the previous year.
However, it must be remembered that, apart from the rise in the past month, the overall admissions of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures for the previous financial year.
Since January as a whole 95.853 vehicles were sold in this number all vehicles from which the vans market is contained: Descendants of passenger cars are, however, pick-ups, vans, small vans and lighter vans / chassis.
Furthermore, the same storm clouds in the sky that the demand is always draw the most affected, because some of the vehicles will also be purchased by private individuals if the Groβteil of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which almost 100%, of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
So it is with these restrictions on what the result of the tap of credit institutions, are other factors of course einschlieβen covered, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this scenario, and unlike the cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the Plan 2000E helped little.
This plan is intended not only to individuals, the self-employed and small businesses have a right to expect that, if they want to be a vans up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 Ausstoss that should not buy 160 grams per kilometre drive excess, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, back to direct) also paid special attention to these small vices and, of course, also on the industrial vehicles (lorries and buses Ganvam had pointed out that it is desperately needed on the part of the state.
The car dealer association predicts a similar year for the year 2010, just like the last, for which it is looking for a sale from case (in passenger cars and SUVs) by 19%.
The support in Bremsmanövern in critical situations is now duty
As at the time of the Antiblockierbremssystem ABS and what is happening now with the ESP stability control, the auxiliary systems on the brakes in emergency situations must be a duty equipment in European cars.
Indeed, they are already mandatory in all newly registered passenger cars and light Kleintransportern, for the remaining vehicles was a Karenzfrist set by the end of February 2011.
The European Union agreed Maβnahme is aimed at increasing the protection of Fuβgänger, but these braking systems, because of their operation can also help to prevent many front-rear collisions.
The task of the Notbremsassistenten is to put more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical Bremsmanövers, which recognises the system on the basis of the Bremsstärke exported by the driver on the brake pedal.
However, this system is exerting this pressure not until the very end.
According to one of the components of the vehicle manufacturer Bosch-commissioned study for a third of the driver involved in an accident before the Zusammenstoss was no longer to engage on the brake pedal and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
To 1.100 accidents
The Bremshilfe against intervention with maximum force in the braking and reducing the Bremszeit and therefore the Bremsabstand, a car is back at the Bremsvorgang.
According to a study by the EU could each year up to 1.100 fatal accidents involving Fuβgänger come to harm, be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of Notbremsassistenten.
It would even be less accidents - it is calculated that every fourth accident involving personal injury could be avoided - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking are popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that recognises (on radar or a camera) obstacles and the driver warns, while at the same time, there has been a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver then responded, helps him the system to increase the pressure on the brake pedal, should it be needed.
If the driver does not react to the warning, and even if the Zusammenstoss is inevitable, the Bremsassistent exercises maximum pressure on the brakes to minimize the damage as low as possible.
General Motors for postponing the plan for Opel until January
While the workforce of the Opel plant in Zaragoza factory (already) by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, there have been informed that the production of the new Meriva will launch in the first week of April, probably on 8, according to Mr Ortega, the American car manufacturer suggests that he needs more time to get the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, after all, wants to ensure that the affected side gives its assent to every aspect of the plan in advance.
And it is for this reason that the final document, which will start by the workers and then the governments of countries in which there are stations presented will delay until the beginning of 2010 could be it.
Dementgegen that it will take in the next few days for a decision on the sale of Saab from GM is assured.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American car builder, so that this is a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to stand with a number of potential new buyers in contact.
One of these buyers could be Geely, which would also like to buy Volvo, however, the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper-sports cars, who was from the Russian group Converg backing wins, increasingly popular support.
If it should come with any of these buyers to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to China's BAIC.
The decision, Saab has been to schlieβen at the end of the year, if it is not sold in the meantime, will continue to maintain.
The tax of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of its latest and most expensive jewel engineers used the Boxster S as a base and made it really is to make it easier for about 80 kilos, and he is now only 1.275 kilo weight.
In order to create something, they believe, was the first to the automatic aufklappbare roof, which has been replaced by a Zeltleinwanddach with manuellem propulsion, so that only one has saved 21 kilos disappear; thanks to this model used aluminum doors as the GT3 "" a further 15; by the removal of the air conditioning again 13; auβerdem one has reduced the fuel tank of 64 to 54 litres, so that further reductions were 7 kilo; through the installation of sporting Bacquet-seats again with the light 12 and 19-@-@ customs saved five wheels again.
Then we had still achieved through the renunciation of the audio system CDR-30 again six kilos less and through the exchange of Türgriffe Griffe from substance by the absence of a kilo.
Although he is also available with the Doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK, the driving test was carried out in a car with 6-established hand wheels, mainly on the smaller Landstraβen of California, on mountain routes that were really very kurvig.
During his driver behaviour, one can give him only the note perfectly.
The reduction of his weight has not meant that he is now less certain on the Straβe would lie.
Rather, the opposite is the case: Since long, we have not been more dangers test a small and easy model that gives a but, at the same time, a feeling of groβer security in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a young athlete rasen, capable of making his muscles in a low gear in the required time warm until we give him the orders, to slow to recover and then back again to get everything from his engine out...
He makes everything they tell him. The car makes everything we suggest him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is just as communicative and precise.
And he makes it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine Sound for all tastes
The Sound of his V6 Boxers with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and you can still raise it with the 'sport' -Option and by means of a system that can change the engine sounds, which already on the Panamera was used for the first time.
The acceleration is unimaginable wealth brutal, whether from the foot out or when re-acceleration.
The Federungen are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the Landstraβen on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder, was damaged already pretty, but the car meisterte the bumps well.
The electronic assistant had to be done on the whole route almost nothing; and that, although we found some of these curves ice at dawn and Rollsplitt this morning.
In summary, it can be said that there is an ultra-light car, a car that has been an indescribable Fahrspass, as otherwise it rather rare and it is much more than just a small improvement on the Boxster SS.
The car will come on the market in February 2010 and cost 70.831 EURO.

The Baskonia gives himself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many oddball players in the team against Mr Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complex Fuβballfeld of Maccabi Electra and benefits in the first place within his party after the groβartigen appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was with eight three times the best of his team) (29 in the assessment.
The team from Vitoria could replace the significant loss of Mr Mann, Oleson, Huertas Micov or by a very broad dose of use and team work, even if they wait until the bitter end muβten on their victory.
The great hit from the Perimeter out with 16 rate three times maβgeblich contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blue Red, which set out from the very beginning to the top of the billboard ads.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came from the Perimeter, one could guess that they had come onto the pitch with good Handgelenken reheated.
It was English and Teletovic, mainly for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter were responsible.
The second quarter was no different, except that the team from Álava province opted for a game of Barac innenseitiges and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with Pfiffen and applause, which is his home (in order to develop their advantage before the break 34-43).
Teletovic began earlier, would highlight itself as the best of his team with 13 points, including wennn "minus six 'assessment of cluster lieβen already guess that this would not be the best night of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, the game was decided in spite of the clear advantage at the break and far from the Makkabäer wanted to remind the Vitorianer once again that everyone is not winning on their pitch, and thanks to the constant attacking "hand of Elías" it came back into play.
And Eidson Pnini contributed decisively to the "Yellow umdrehten" the helm (50-49).
More disadvantages.
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but far from dead prepare, had to play a few trains with accuracy to get back in the air and one of them the gun of Mirza Teletovic who expressed with almost three consecutive three times and with the support of English and Ribas came so suddenly that einberuhigender gap has been on the table of ads displayed again by (54-67), which the hosts could adorn at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The last quarter were Alavesen bloβgestellt and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that it would allow anyone to them the victory which they are in the first minute dreiβig honestly earned had to take away again.
Nevertheless, resigned Pnini Eidson and to the best of their team and not trying to give their team back by three points from the line (70-77) power.
Nevertheless, and despite the cluster was called for by the place Fouls the team of Ivanovic, not on, defended well and although the Israelis) or in the last minute aufholten (80-85, the game had already been a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja's customary was
Unicaja lost cede vociferously against Olympiacos in Greece and had to take the lead in Group B of the Euro League in it, and that in a game that through the failure on the part of the players from Unicajas (free country, Lima and Archibald was), particularly marked in the domestic game, what the Greeks facilitated the victory.
The team from Malaga had no fear of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship before the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the most of Europe and a lot of money.
Thus thanks to their game in the first quarter of the Andalusians were allowed to begin to dream. An aggresive defence arrangements and three consecutive three times, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, dazzled the hosts with 12-18 in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos was of the intensity of the ereins Unicaja surprised, even if the local team with a domestic game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed that the ads anzeigte table in the 13th minute 22-20 in their favour, the minute in which it would have come as a result of an action almost to thuggery between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and so both have been disqualified.
The Greek team began to be warm and finally hinterlieβen his superiority in a game of two halves, while the departure of the Englishman Joel Free State because of an injury and the three self-induced error by Carlos Jiménez marked lanes at the Unicaja.
Among their players in the domestic arena and the Lithuanian Vorspieler Linas Kleizas, with its three times, they increased-their advantage in the 19th minute at 44 32.
Figure was impossible
The third game quarter marked by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos from which showed 19 losses despite his superior and even managed to make up the difference of Malaga in most game with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which caused leadership seemingly within the group.
Unicaja tried to defaults on the many and the departure of the injured during the match Scots Robert Archibald walk.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja came in the 31st minute thanks to the leadership and the three times by Cook and the use of Lewis back a bit of hope for 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible because the Olympiacos as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimetres basket inside the area to put the brakes on was not.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37-minute, to allow the basket difference at 81-62 and Unicaja had to be beaten and had to surrender the leadership anOlympiacos.

Thank you!
After the most tempting days since last spring, in which inflation of assets was the prevailing mood in the markets, is back on the markets once the insecurity, which is in no way surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the broker make decisions on an inherently uncertain future.
The to stabilize the markets Maβnahme was used to buy it to pay off the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly to let the liquidity free rein in interest rates, the move to zero, so that in this way the totting up the banking assets.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets are virtually ended and without compromising their heterodox policy of liquidity in question, begin to spread some sand in the wheels, as leading eighth the BCE näc already with its annual auction, which takes place next week.
That is why investors doubt the ability of the world economy to sustain the economic recovery without these heterodox Maβnahmen and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The Flüchtigkeiten the stock market and the differences in corporate bonuses will rise again, even if they are still a long way from the para-normal amounts they peaked at the beginning of the year.
The states had to nationalize private risks and the public debt to rise again.
It is now back on quality and the US, Japan and Germany are leading the preferred haven of investors, which in turn to an increase of the differences of the eurozone countries in regard to Germany.
Spain has been hit until now little of this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards on the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty damages not to force the defender to silence the moral hazard that had tried again, with the leaders of the world economic policy awareness to produce what they had caused, because they had slowed down the devastating effects on which the restriction of loans led to the loss of jobs, when they should really have a new day beschlieβen thanks to action.
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai points, to a tribal war between the Emiren to restore power in the Emirates and development in Greece was also expected earlier.
A government that the national debt glosses, elections and a new government, which draws on the same side.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary saves at the beginning of the year from the non-compliance of their foreign payments, and therefore a euro member country rules, no longer meet its commitments.
However, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens in need of auβergewöhnlicchen Maβnahmen with an obligation to maintain the stability of state money.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some Ausschweifungen in excessive amounts, it would now lie within the expected.
In the case of Spain, they should not worry, as long as the differences of public debt rise at the same speed as the European corporate bonuses.
However, the European differences should reduce and increase the Spanish further dannn would be a special Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local early indicators of a Groβteil market research institutes compel their scenarios for the recovery and her preferable scenario for 2011 upwards to correct the einschlieβlich OCDE and the European Commission, which again with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy comes along, promises despite all the warnings of a long life.
Once again, it looks as if it was an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although caution when driving is, at the moment, "" the order of the day.

The chairman of Iberdrola, of Ignacio Sánchez Galán, acting as first yesterday before the subcommittee of the House, where the strategy is being debated in these days in terms of energy supply of Spain in the next two decades.
After his appearance, the chairman of the Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca followed Galán the press gave some key points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind versschlossenen doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola of Spain needs to invest 50 billion by 2020 Euround further 60 billion by 2030 from that date, will depend on the fact that the current nuclear power stations to remain in operation.
This should not be the case that the needed investment would not amount to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the view that one should not invest more in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international groupings.
From 2020, the issue will change and they should increase the performance.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to sterilize the carbon dioxide and, of course, especially on renewable energy.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW will need more, under the Vorraussetzungnatürlich by other "Stützenergien."
Galán, who believes that the Gesetentwurf is for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, in line with what has called for his company, wanted to say anything in any case against this law to create as incentives for the national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his view, "it is clear in this direction in the long term, despite some" individual "Maβnahmen, as she described the chairman of Iberdrola.
Be it as it may, Galán believes that we should already make the decisions on the investment, even if they are in the long term, because it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.

The game in the Champions League has put Madrid and Barça 476,4 million since the beginning.
The Champions League has since its emergence Fuβballclubsentwickelt in 1992 to a source of income for the.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona, have taken since then 476,4 million, putting them at the third and fifth place of Fuβballclubs who earns the most money in the league.
Leader of this list is Manchester United.
Leader of this list is Manchester United.
To win the UEFA Champions League, brings not only glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue of the big clubs.
The League has distributed according to UEFA 5.362,5 million euros to the 105 teams (from 12 Spanish) participating in this event since its founding in the season in 1992-1993.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The weiβe club lies in third place of Europe, who earns the most money through his participation and alongside the AC Milan, the only person who has won the trophy three times.
Of the acting Catalan champion and recent winner of the former Europacups 1992 ranks fifth place.
The list to lead Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that has occupied auβerdem even the most money through their participation in the past Champoins League.
And, although they have lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third of the countries that have einehmen through the Champions money, although it has more titles than any other (five, unlike four bie Italy, three in England, and two in Germany).
Distribution of
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complex cash award procedure that UEFA uses.
In this business year, the organisation, whose president Michel Platini has held up, with revenues of 1.090 million by the Champions League.
Of that money, the UEFA provides 413,1 million for fixed payments: Each of the 20 Fuβballclubs participating in the qualification before round (including the Atlético de Madrid) gained 2.1 million.
Auβerdem got those-won a participation, 3.8 million through their bloβe presence, in addition to the EUR 550.000 for each game, which they denied.
There is also a bonus for profits (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 per team). The clubs that have come into the eighth finals, each received three million; the four, who came into the quarter-finals, 3.3 million.
The last four each receiving 4 million.
The winners earned 9 million, in contrast to the Second, which receives 5.2 million.
So a Fuβballclub at least 7.1 million and a maximum gets 31.2 million in fixed income.
In turn, Barça earned with his victory in the European Supercup 2.5 million in August.
However, the variable payments, earmarked for the 337,8 millions are yet to come.
This money will be awarded proportional to the value of every individual television market.
The Spanish is among the first and has 4 allotted seats.
The mayor of last year gets 40% of the allotted currency, 30% of the second, 20% of Drittplatzierte and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part is distributed depending on the number of games they play in this year's edition.

New programmes for the evaluation of vehicles
In these days of storms and accidents not only increases on merit-workshops
Every day, thousands of cars that have been involved in an accident, towed in the workshops, where an assessment of the damage and the cost needs to assess the repair.
Not a single accident is equal and the calculation of the cost of the parts and working hours can be a long and complex task.
The calculation of the repair cost of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, einschlieβlich of parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
However, it is with the support of the latest computer tools in a matter of minutes

Cost estimates of the workshop in four stages
With the tool Auda-Taller the company Audatex ensures that the user receives in only four stages an estimation, the identification of the vehicle, search of spare parts, and provide a cost estimate.
The ease of use of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince the older professionals, who are usually more or less against the use of this new computer techniques.
The database includes 1.034 vehicles, 666 of them are passenger cars, 109 SUVs, 137 motorcycles, 44 78 vans and trucks.
Of course, you need to use a computer with internet connection.
After the repair of model has been identified by the Fahrgestellnummer, a diagram of the respective model looks and then the needed spare part will be selected.
The user can integrate with variables, such as the price for the working hours, Aufpreise or rebates and then he can leave the Council estimate and pass on to its customers.
AudaTaller, however, is not a tool for evaluation as AudaPlus, but rather a reference list.
The main difference between the two systems is that it contains no aimed at dieWerkstatt estimated working hours.
The use of this tool for cost EUR 350 euros a year, a sum that the customer can easily pay.
At present, the company is working Audatex to be able to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation in the auto mechanics can wait for a long time, since you can select a door with her, for example, and reverse the picture then fully to look at the inner side.
