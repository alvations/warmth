What he will do? the Social Democrats in Prague knows Voldemort or the candy store
New main city councillor from the Social Democrats will have to seems to overcome a language barrier in Prague to the Council and in the site of understanding of their staronovým colleagues from the ODS.
Journal told members of the new Council of Social Democrats "test," as they know notoriously established slang that emerged during the last few years to City Hall, when the Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
Coded vocabulary that Prague's political brass introduced during the previous era Mayor Paul béma, describing some of the most famous figures of the situation and kauz in the capital.
Surprisingly enough, showed that new councillor known those do not understand the too.
At least that's what he says.
"Who is he?"
"I really don't."
"I'm in the policy of talking about," responded to the test "kmotrovského" councillor vocabulary for culture, kaucký.
And although it is a political veteran, responded Similarly, City Councilman Karel Březina.
To the concept of "Golf well."
"This is the only expression of those what you are giving me that I use sometimes."
"Otherwise, I recognise slang in general."
From the vocabulary, the terms of which Czech Journal published this year in June, prior to the election Congress can chose newsroom six examples, mainly those which are notoriously linked to Prague Town Hall.
Socialists should explain the concepts of "Voldemort," "the greatest golf well in Prague," "go to the candy store," "bull neck," "betrayal of the capital city" and "oplechovat."
Three of the councillors agreed with kvízem, fourth - antonín weinert, that is for the future of heading the pražskému education - the first conversation promised later, but did not answer the phone.
Fifth Councilman Peter dolínek straight test refused.
"These things really don't care and that's how to enjoy the Civic Democrats, I won't be evaluated."
"I now covered here, how can we understand it in the framework of our programs," he responded.
As has already been said, City Councilman Luke kaucký would in the caption allegedly couldn't tell that we are talking about influential business and friend exprimátora béma Romano janouškovi.
"Voldemort" kauckému means nothing to him and the only Term that the test correctly guessed, is "the greatest golf well in Prague."
"That is a tunnel," he says kaucký, and immediately adds: "But I know that more of the paper."
"I have to pay some language course," vtipkuje.
Golf swing then like a tunnel of the administration of the dešifruje not only matador Karel Březina, but also Councillor for the environment, shy.
Then know both of the Social Democrats who is really Voldemort, and lukáši plachému, it is familiar to find where this figure - suspected the importance of the term "to go to a candy store."
"I think this means to go to some of the Prague undertaking," is shy close to the explanation that this is the headquarters of janouškových firms.
Same with březinou recalls that knowledge načerpal from newspapers, rather than to use such a dictionary.
In the social democracy by the frekventantů test no similar to a familiar vocabulary slang terms does not exist.
"I advised also with colleagues, but it looks like that really have nothing like this."
"We say more names, some use abbreviations and distortions names," says the president of the Prague Czech Petr hulínský, which straníci přezdívají hulda.
"on the school told me to say, but I don't know if the colleagues call me that," according to their own alias of Charles Březina.
Newspaper told the name, and works.
Councilman weinert is for straníky Grandpa or less friendly old man, zastupitel Miroslav few weeks, which to draw the attention to each other before the election fraud in sponsoring parties, has a nickname for some colleagues "igráček."
Nick are also the only thing that the Social Democrats in vnitrostranické speaking admit.
Hulínský said huldu like to hear, but the Czech recorded and another nickname of Prague President.
"Dr. obuškového rights" He recalls that Petr hulínský won his title judr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.

Moreover, adds more commitment: all the money from the rent increase by SEE chart put the company back in apartments, mainly to heat savings - new windows and insulation.
The priority is to get people who sign an agreement to increase the hiring of.

Fascinated by House of bones and after 100 years. Look to the interior from gaudího
Roof looks like back pravěkého lizards, the backbone of dinosaur and balconies of fish species are open mouth.
This is the House of Casa measures to batlló in Barcelona from the Catalan architect antoni gaudího.
From local a house thanks to its organic shapes earned him the House of the bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of rock debris kachlů and Mosaic, facade of scales, and the presence of the soft lines, all of this is typical of secessionism antoni gaudího.
The front of the house one's the quarterback dream line, tender color and texture of nature and animals.
In the detailed observations is to see geometričnost, rhythm and precisely measured order.
In the night of the facade of the home is even more dramatic Rightwards is so as to be the glamour of color, yet umocněn.
The winding and twisting shape is also occurring in equal measure in the interiors.
Wood in the waves of copying the window frames, rail, decorative elements of the door, watch and bar.
The House batlló, who is in the eixample on the busy shopping street passeig de grácia no. 43, a house conversion from 1877 from architect Emilio Sala cortese.
Reconstruction there was two years and the building was completed in 1906.
Investor, a wealthy industrialist, Josep batlló, initially insisted on the demolition of old buildings and creating a completely new, but soon adopted gaudího idea for an unusual and cheaper transformation.
Apartment house Casa batlló but antoni gaudí did not suggest himself.
Cooperated with him an architect, Josep Maria jujol.
It was on his projektantském plank created decorations for the representative apartment owner of real estate and use of the facade.
Work on the facade and a number of other artists and artists.
The joint work on the proposals of the House Casa batlló started a successful cooperation jujola with gaudím.
Jujol helped build gaudího House of Casa nice and park güell, in which they are more gaudího works.
From local a house soon after completing his thanks to its organic shapes the nickname "house of the bones."
Others him due to the specific mechanism of the opening windows started to "zívajícím house."
Says also that on top of the building is vypodobněn sword of St George, a patron of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motives include other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí into the house proposed to its time unique central heating system with odvětrávacími vents and typical chimneys.
Bizarre may seem their forty five stupňový tilt.
When drafting the gaudí absolutely respect the building codes and not tie them down.
At the beginning of May have gained a construction permit from the city, but it referred to information on planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later in completing the city council was the result of'm horrified and asked for the improvement.
Local councillor mind, for example, the fact that the construction of over pillars and to the public.
To remedy never took place, on the contrary, just 15 days after the call of urban areas, Josep batlló applied, and successfully gained permission to lease two of the top floors of the building.
Owner himself into the lower levels.
In the second floor of the gallery was a social salon and in the third floor of the bedroom and private parts of the apartment.
The ground floor was been let shop.
The whole šestipatrový House cuts staircase, which can be rise up to the roof terrace.
The essential elements of the reconstruction of the suspension of all the right angles and direct lines and their replacement curving walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of linking the area.
Social part can be opening salonních completely link the door, and more society can comfortably communicate with each other, and he wouldn't at the same time her privacy needed for intimnější talks.
House with gaudího conversion, in addition to new facades also unconventional roofs and, moreover, two floors.
Is also impressive gaudího game with light, blue and white glazované tiles that one's internal auditors, and skylights.
Game two colors adds a maximum of light in all floors of the house.
Enough simply bet on the principle that white light more than the dark, which reflects the sun's rays On the contrary consumes.
Casa House batlló, which in 2005 was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund, everyone can visit.
In the first floor of the house is most spacious and nejhonosnější apartment made available to the public.
Owners have chosen for this step up in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of a hundred of the birth of the famous artist fiftieth anniversary.
For the controls remained as they found that it is a very beneficial business and, moreover, surveys passed on common and 6 areas, including the roof terrace.
Admission to the monuments is certainly not insignificant, is 16,50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist průkazek have 20% discount.
The sum is significantly higher than the price of vstupného to other gaudího buildings in the city.
If you want a taste of the mood of the house with dračími steeples, you need to quickly make friends with one of the inhabitants of the House and to visit him straight at home.
How to choose the mattress and grid: women have other requirements than men
Not a splendid bed frame, but lehací quality of the area, mattresses and grid, provide the basis for a really good bed.
But they must harmoniously complement to suit the specific user.
In selecting shall be decided by a lot of things, from the weight, height, age, health and gender owner.
Type of Interior is also important, to which the mattress and are buying grid.
A typical example?
To be on the weekend cottages, where regularly, but nobody has a latex mattress are not appropriate, because the slower "heated."
Also have significantly greater weight than the standard polyurethane mattress.
It is to be regularly call.
Because if they don't have a lot of the dump pipes in core, and is still lies on the Solid board holds humidity: Below could be and blight.
In selecting shall act also habit.
Who spent a long time in the state, where a lot of high mattress are often used in the změkčující layer, it will be difficult to feel good on low and with the hard surface.
"Perhaps all who were returning from hockey players from the NHL, had me complained that there is any sleep."
"To His battered shoulders, heel and hips needed mattresses, změkčující lazy foam layer."
"Such are recommended even for people with diabetes, who have a nervous system disorder, so badly takes over, the information" of the joints and skin, "he says sylva hadamcziková that specialises the upholstered furniture.
Many hokejistům, but also other customers therefore years ago sent mattress with lazy foam.
"Now it's okay, appropriate mattress has to be tempur, Italian magniflex, but also the Czech tropico."
You don't have to be a guy from the NHL to appreciate lazy foam.
This "miracle" simply works.
Optimizes its stiffness and shape by absorbovaného heat or to adjust to your warm body.
Nothing pressing you, at night, you won't tumbling as after the game.
Just you'll rest better.
Lazy foam also works as a protection against proleženinami.
In selecting the size of the mattress with his height to add to the length of the feet, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm and in need of a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum for one should be at the dvoulůžka 90 cm, 180 cm, together.
In separate beds, such as the singlistů, it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
For comfort and possible visit.
"otherwise the rule for the simple: bed while lying on his back YOU SHOULD HAVE hands comfortably slightly bent at the elbow," says Ing. Helena prokopová, cechmistryně čalouníků and dekoratérů Guild, which is addressing the issue of common sleep and ergonomie furniture for a number of years and chanting her on the professional schools.
At the dvoulůžka needs each own grid and mattress, here, however, careful not to purchase to reconcile mattress height.
Otherwise be nothing other than wrap grids in different heights, but that you for each bed frame may fail.
The foam mattresses should have at least 14 cm in height, types with spring out at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on the shape and raising layer.
"at the hands of contact or dosednutí on the mattress Certainly you can't feel," Helena prokopová warns springs.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grid.
Celočalouněná beds where mattresses and background are as srostlá conjoined twins, they do not have what to do in the bedrooms.
Mattress wrong větrají, unable to wash their skin, which already is normal.
And because a night normally vypotíme 0.2 to grapevines sweat, so it is clear that after five to seven years of mattress starts to remind one of great sieve, and at a standstill.
Also because experts reject advertising slogans on the life of the mattress to 25 years, or even a lifetime guarantee.
But everything has its but.
And that is why the Council from the practice from vendors: the mattress with a 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and the work of the snímatelný film do not give up, but add to prefer mattress buffer that you can easily take and wash.
Even if today is normally produce mattress covers the zdrhovadly around the district, so we get two parts after opening, a lot of important for money and size of washing machines!, could still manipulation by the larger types, and in one person in scan to commemorate the fight light weight in the ring with heavy.
You have a place in bed, a record?
Never!
A maximum of the bed for the visit for one night.
Record, yet the, if it is already has. air vents and use the mattress with spring skeleton and height of at least 15 cm with springs in the bags, from něm.taschenfederkern and raising layer.
Polyurethane mattress does not belong to such a background.
On nepolohovací laminated grids with 14 to 18 lamelami will be appropriate latex or sandwich mattresses by a need for the combination of latex and coconut, but you always pays grids, with a greater number of lamel, 28, and more, where vanes are in the field of the European double and it is possible to regulate their stiffness.
On the positioning laminated grids are not mattress with spring out, because the positioning are frozen.
In addition to setting tuhosti lamel you can take and the shoulder cradle.
It is a special snapping lamel, which allows you to push or even know lamelu, so as to shoulder the sleeper a "stabbed at items of particular interest."
For the men, who "have the shoulders of through the back" certainly an important thing.
Even remember her even mattress makers who, in the "Gentleman" began to use změkčující zone just in the field of her shoulders.
On women also remember - those they again softer surface in places of hip surgery.
For the most demanding customers are intended křidélkové or destičkové grids of the multitorzním pérováním.
Pressure is to more points and reduces tensions.
Attention, however, when you use the right mattress and the bad pillow," naducaný big and," most of the "plus" disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow is to support his head on its back and with only intervene to shoulders so that they can to free the shoulder muscles.
As an appropriate size is encouraged 50 x 60 cm, which prefer, for example, in Scandinavia.
While lying on the side should balance the pillow, together with the shoulder the cradle of, or změkčenou zone in the mattress. shoulder height.
Modern mattresses are with the original slamníky plněnými grasses there is something in common.
Their producers is increasingly use natural materials or at least the matter.
Trend is also just the mattress bio.
Raw material of oil, of which make polyurethane foam, the natural oils are replaced, for example, from skočce and soya.
Just soybeans used perhaps all of the known producers.
"Bio the mattress means that the core is made from material of purely natural origin," explains Petr vašíček from the company tropico plus.
Natural substances are used in the manufacture of mattress blankets as well, one of The first was aloe vera.
But you can also take mikrokapsle to you uvolňovala fresh smell of forest or lavender.
There is also the Division for men and women.
While men "Cooling" Vegetable extract from of that team mattress absorbed the heat and cool the body, women, on the other hand, covers "drowning."
Extract from the red peppers increases blood circulation, so it is the weaker sex warmer.
Today's favorites?
Foam mattress made from the cold, has more pores with a cellular structure, it's so prodyšnější than normal polyurethane and also offers better elasticitu.
The combination of different tuhostí cold foams and "lazy" foam is vícezónové mattress, which they know exactly where to be a head, shoulders and heels.
You'll pay for the quality of the mattress from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those that meet health parameters, have a lower rate of VAT, are taken as medical supplies.
As the first to reach the in the Czech Republic to this advantage gumotex.
To save for a mattress and grid is not easy.
Sometimes can be used to be the actions producers or vendors who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
To mark magniflex offers the mattress duofreeze with všitou memory foam memory to the skin in 11 990 crowns.
The other can, of course, have a free of charge.
The era of lazy or viskoelastických foam with open cellular structure and a high density of started "The space" at a rate of material tempur.
Began originally as material for NASA, because at startech astronauts were exposed to an enormous overload.
Tempur warm soften, out in the cold, on the contrary, zpevňuje.
A warm human body is so perfectly adapt and dismantle his optimum pressure.
It is therefore ideal against the occurrence of proleženin, but also for the increase comfort in your sleep.
Viskoelastické foam used not only on mattresses, but also on the medical products, to be a special pillows beneath the feet, which odlehčují feet and žilnímu system.
Domestic producers used, for example, foam eucatherm C or twinsaver, and so on.
Apparatus for monitoring people want more and more parents want so as to guard their children
Worry about my own child brings more and more people to the idea of guard over GPS.
System originally made for the search for the cars may not monitor the movement of people, and this will also help to be in such cases, the disappearance of devítileté aničky janatkové.
Device is so far about the size of a box from the matches, but soon may be just a big watch.
A number of people said the case of missing aničky and started to better protect the quest for means, as their children.
Even at the cost of their privacy.
"We have all to say that it is not about the spying, but on other means to reduce the likelihood that it would be a tragedy," says Peter bits of wood from the macro Weil company, which is one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment to the Czech market.
"I admit that in a case can be a abuse of such equipment, like when you're in the bag of someone who doesn't know about this, but we still are met with such a case."
"Most of it really customers buy sawdust for security reasons," he added.
According to him, would always child should know for what purpose "box" serve and how to use in case of an emergency.
Child Psychologist Dana bočková draws attention to the fact that if the child won't carry anything like it, just get rid of it.
"Even very young children showed great creativity in the way some things on purpose to lose, if they don't want to be under control."
"Great expectations of earlier for parents of cell phones, which, however, can turn off a tracking device like this," says bočková.
According to it is also questionable whether they could really help such facilities in case of attack.
"When it comes to the kidnapping, shall be the perpetrator virtually always that the child with him had no electronics, which could reveal his position."
"Now it is a phone."
"When they begin to spread a tracking device, and they're going to look for them, because their sales will surely supported by a massive advertising."
"In that case the criminals will be always one step ahead of the police," says psychologist.
Acknowledges, however, that a similar device may help in the case of a sudden attack pedofilem.
According to Robert čecha from the RC monitoring company, which offers tracking service for cars, as well as for people, even in the event when it comes after the assault for the immediate destruction of surveillance equipment, his presence can help.
"equipment can be set on regular sending position after a certain period of time."
"If the damage was done, will be available for at least the last position of the person concerned."
"More expensive equipment have incorporated and náklonometry, so, even if you just slipped and lay still, will send the immediate warning with an indication of position," says Bohemia.
According to him, a similar service can do and smart mobile phones with the navigation, where you can just load and special software.
The problem lies in the fact that it is either current surveillance units on the instrument similar přívěskům size of a packet of matches or smaller mobile phones.
Always so face their loss.
According to pilina from macro Weil, so that's why now is testing equipment looking like normal digital watch.
"It will have the biggest advantage in the fact that any aggressor does not even recognize a tracking device."
"or it is a time to recognize and that can give the police the extra time," he adds.
Unfold whether with a tracking device to bangles or přívěsků, still will use the same technology, what is used to guard the cars.
It is a combination of the survey position through the GPS system, which use common autonavigace. And the mobile phone that the current position of the car reports.
Military has ignition lines, that would obmotaly the Czech Republic. But will only two years
The Czech army acquired 445 miles of the lines, which are firing explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense gave the lines in the warehouses of 224 kilometers.
Army so has provisions for 225 years.
The problem is that the durability of lines is two or four years.
Army bought fuse just from the stock stv GROUP a. s. worth 40 million crowns.
The General Staff in the justification for the purchase of such a huge quantity of ignition lines MF today wrote that soldiers uses 60 kilometres in training detonating cord per year.
Of the calculations of Army mine clearers addressed by MF today, however, shows that it would be very intense pyrotechnickým training had to pass each year and all the generals, officers of the command of the army, secretaries, and cleaners.
Defense Minister Alexander vondru and commander of the army vlastimila picka including.
Only then would be justified the annual consumption of the army of 60 miles detonating cord.
This length is 25 thousand explosions.
And even if that's what really was, the Army Reserves would be enough for more than ten years.
If, on the other hand, would, as a result to basic training that each new professional just not more than two meters of fuse just, say experts, and the army of the fresh purchase to - even with increased consumption of ženijních or special forces - supplies for the 225 years.
Troops of the Rapid Reaction Brigade, the Minister vondrovi personally recently complained that they have almost no bullets into the small arms, so that they are even shooting restricted because of lack of money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I head takes it, that it will buy from us repeatedly and a large amount of detonating cord."
"But it is their decision and will know to what they will be."
"For us, it is the army a good customer, which, as traders trying to meet," says the manager stv group Jan děcký.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan pejšek justifies hundreds of kilometres purchased the cord and the fact that the army will have stocks of this "munitions" at least ten years.
Jan děcký from stv group, however, this is only about four years of the life cycle squib. And the police or army Bomb Disposal Unit even just two years.
"It may be in perfect storage and the four," says one of them, who, as a soldier because of the criticism of the army wanted to publish the name.
After the service life must be carefully test each bombs whether it is more reliable and does not harm soldiers on life.
However, these tests are not free of charge and cost more money.
Another argument Ministry is a bulk discount on 445 miles of ignition lines.
"cost us about 60 percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred čtyřiačtyřiceti miles," it conveys a spokesman pejšek the opinion of Department of Defense buyer.
In comparison, annual consumption launch of the lines of police mine clearers, who eliminated or here after the Soviet army ammunition from the Second World War, does not exceed 1 500 metres for several years.
And police orders always just such quantities to this ammunition or even before the expiry of the life cycle.
It worked for the safety of the mine clearers, and may in the flexibility to raise more modern, and, therefore, more reliable types of lines.
The Defense Ministry has already considerable difficulties in cleaning the tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact, when dvousettisícová Czechoslovak Army prepared to tow on Rhine.
The Czech according to mine clearers addressed by MF today, waiting for a couple of years of the same problem: will dispose of hundreds of miles of old detonating cord, which now "cheap" Buy.
Still draw tremendous of contacts, which I give thanks to the competition
Winning a place in the competition trafficker year helped lukáši pytlounovi in sale of a franchise with his hotel.
Winner last year of competition trafficker of became a osmadvacetiletý businessman Luke Bagman of Liberec.
His story of success is like a film.
Luke Bagman I traveled.
And abroad realized that is lacking in Liberec quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
Of savings from foreign brigades and using the bank credit bought polorozbořený house with five apartments.
That was a student in the third year of high school, it was a great courage.
"The ratio between the quality and price of accommodation for US gave me to that tried to do something," says Luke Bagman.
The first reconstructed apartment began to lease foreign workers.
All profit invested back into the house, which gradually over the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, him for seven years of business gradually managed to open four guesthouses in Liberec, two stylish restaurant and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
Most comfortable of them was recently about Bagman design hotel.
This year to him but find themselves with another, as good.
"We have just signed a contract with the hotel in the island at tisé, where we're sold our franšízingový concept and other bidders for franšízu hotels Bagman reporting," says last year's number one trafficker.
"And a great role in this sale of the operating licence of the hotel was just a trafficker of victory in the competition," adds approvingly Bagman.
Victory gave him more known and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognising me on the street, I often have subsequently gratulovali and I have to say that it was a pleasant," he says.
It recommends everyone who took a little, trying to participation in the competition.
Nor is it necessary to win every visibility is good.

"It is not far from a simple my personal success, this is the result of a good work of all of us together."
"Only my name is vystrčeno to the fore," he says modestly Luke Bagman.
I wish my successor calmer year than we did in farmetu
The euphoria of winning quickly replaced the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to cílevědomosti winners but there is a farmet worse times in a row.
For the prize for first place in the past year of the competition of firm Vodafone, last year in the Slavic house owner out of farmet, Karel žďárský.
Jury had appreciated the efforts, through which built from a small nástrojářské workshop in the Czech skalici company with stamilionovými turnover.
"I can say that the award was not only I, but all of my staff and increase us confidence for the match with competition," says last year's winner today.
At the beginning of the history of farmet was the desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered Father Charles žďárského for rent a small dílničku as a compensation for the communists zabavený assets, long did not hesitate, refused the career in the company, where he worked at the time, and with a couple of friends around his father founded the company in a plastic tub.
Soon later started to specialize in presses vegetable oil.
After 18 years of them has become the largest producer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
Greater awareness, and between the neodbornou public the company received the success in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers began to see the brand of the farmet significantly better, but also the foreign partners began to appreciate that shall cooperate with the company, which had more success in their own country," says Charles žďárský.
Last year, however, he was not in the farmetu only in a sign of euphoria of vítězsví.
Awards was based on the economic performance of the company by 2008, and only in part of the year 2009.
And this is the year 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of engineering goods.
During the height of the crisis, which is still so never touched citizens, but companies they already stopped their investment projects and started to limit purchases of new machinery and technology.
"This situation is, of course, no to us."
"sales decreased by 40 percent, we had to reduce production and took place and the job cuts," explains Karel žďárský.
Viable company must be able to do sometimes and such unpopular measures.
The situation but managed and keep the firm in profit, even if less than before the crisis.
From what, but in farmetu neslevili, is an investment in research and development.
"We built research and training center of the subsidies, we have strengthened the presentation in International Fairs, received the award in domestic shows," he says žďárský.
Everything indicates that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are rising again and with them, the number of new employees.
"The new winners have a great sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," said Charles žďárský.
Poll that eliminate the nonsensical provisions
Poll on the absurdity of race is the fourth part of the business.
Some nonsensical regulations has now been cancelled.
Neslavným winner in the next year of the absurdity of the year was obliged to wear on the authority of the documents, which are also accessible online officials.
More than a third of less than four thousand voters decided on it.
, for example, the Social Security Administration required paper listing of the commercial register, even if it can get an official two kliknutími mouse.
Thanks to the survey that will change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration already excerpt from the commercial register the checks for paying premiums would not require," the spokesman said čssz Jana buraňová.
A light, on all of the rules and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must comply, and cancel the ridiculous the absurdity of the competition.
The race is a part of the business for the fourth time this year with economic newspapers and the public enjoys still more popular.
If the last year about Three thousands of voters take part in the vote, this year, you've already been almost four thousand.
And, not surprisingly, various legal obligations, which serves only to delay business, it's with the US still lots and lots of.
"We should be in the number of papers for tax return to the top in the world," notes the Karel havlíček from association of small and medium enterprises and businesses of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying business is becoming the avowed goal of all governments in the last few years.
Compared with the rest of the world, but in the Czech Republic the situation not particularly improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic from the point of view of the conditions for business ranks 74 position, this is about eight seats less than last year.
The absurdity of the year was declared for the first time in 2006 and each year is in accordance with the same scenario.
Log on administrative and bureaucratic nonsense can anyone each year from April to the end of September, when it is closing competition.
To log on serves a Web address www.firmaroku.cz then host the competition has seven candidates for "anticenu" and let the public during the October vote on her over the Internet in the pages www.firmaroku.cz/absurdity and www.ihned.cz.
Absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
In this year's survey was recorded more than a hundred, or at least 105 legislation and regulations lacking sense.
Tips submitted entrepreneurs, but also the professional unions and journalists.
Between "The finalists" competition, as well as between nominovanými found, for example, a requirement for trucks for the maintenance of highway and express roads paid tolls, or to entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two agencies and two toilets painted every two years.
A list of proposals is published on the website of competition of this year's sevens.
The declaration of competition, which is always on Wenceslas Square in Prague in early November, is part of the hapenningu, which is regularly participates in the personality of political and social life.
This year, for example, in the case of the climax of the contest, Eva I, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and the businesses of the Czech Republic or Petr cone, President of Chamber of Czech Republic.
"economic prosperity cannot work there, where state throw a spanner in business people, that is why it is my intention to cancel every year at least three dozen paragraphs, which only needlessly complicate business today," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin doll.
To interfere with the absurd regulation nevyznívá fell flat.
In 2007, the people I do most of the responsibility of entrepreneurs report three days in advance živnostenskému office in the place where the is a permanent establishment, intention to go to stall for exhibition or festival.
This obligation amendment was deleted, this law.
The second most hlasovaná duty in the year 2007, which has been reporting the employment office for its foreign employees of a business trip to the extent of up to 30 days, it has been deleted law on Green Card.
And for the third time of all good.
Absurdity of 2009 happened to Regulation fyzioterapeutům have large mirror, a refrigerator and two land weight in the office.
It was in the year by order of the Ministry of Health mitigated - to have a refrigerator was cancelled.

On pozemkovém Fund in Plzen police arrest in a public competition
In the building of the Liegenschaftsfonds in Plzen arrest of the anti corruption police in recent days.
Irons detectives they local entrepreneurs in the media sector and real estate businessman luboši G.
The reportedly tried to manipulate the current public competition to settle pending claims for restitution distinguish so that the oil has received specific lead in the competition.
He had for the luboši G. pay half a million crowns.
"So far I can only confirm that the police is dominated by one person for offense of meddling in public order and the public competition," said boss law for the Public Prosecutor's Office Antonie green, on the pretext that cannot provide other details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
šestačtyřicetiletého entrepreneurs police released after 24 hours to freedom.
On how he could influence public competition, can only speculate given the low point of official information.
A spokesman for the Liegenschaftsfonds lubomíra black on the questions of law said that the odloučeném workplace in Plzen police really zatýkali, during a public competition.
"It was a client, not our employees," said.
Public competition has the correct name according to the black "invitation to tender of transfer of land in accordance with the law of the land" and being held in the case when the oil of land will be more interested eligible applicants.
"These persons within the framework of the challenges offer higher value of their pending claims for restitution distinguish, which are to be settled before the transfer was announced the value of property."
"according to the offered claims is determined by the acquirer order and Land Fund then converts land person, which offered the highest claims," the Fund spokesman explained.
Luboš G. had probably Information, who came to the challenges of the end, and because he is also the competent person because bought a number of pending claims for restitution distinguish, he offered buyers of land that is not represented in the competition.
For it probably had the money out of severance pay.
This would explain that he was in detention and a large sum of money.
Luboš G. had superior contacts on the PF in Plzen has been in the past.
Was seen in the case of former Chief of PF of Vaclav sankota, who was prosecuted for the fact that he gave in the alternative restitution of the land on which it has a decision has been taken on the location of the building.
That's when he luboš G. from the fund, for example, a land for the construction of public infrastructure, specifically in the place where the minibar field should build arrival thoroughfare in the industrial zone.
Later it is very favourably směnil with Town Hall for a house in the historic center of the city, which had a far higher value.
Then City Hall had to agree to do that, because otherwise it would land retractors construction threatened.
Households on housing připlatí hundreds of a month
Households will have to from January připlatit not only for all types of energy, but also for water and stočné, heat supply and will rise somewhere and rents.
Families so they will have to from January out of the pockets of up to hundreds of crowns a month more than now.
Electricity rates to go up to by 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, up on the tenth in some cities you'll have to připlatit for water supply and mnohde also podraží supply central heat.
Electricity hikes should households in the homes out a year on stokoruny more than now.
Force electricity prices, cut all major suppliers, a significant increase of the aid is to blame the production from renewable energy sources, in particular photovoltaics.
While gas rates to go up slightly, but at a time when people most drowning and have such high consumption.
So a year must also count with hundreds of extra crowns.
While electricity and gas rates to go up all over the country, a change in the price of central heating a different place from the place.
Price increases are planning mainly more communities.
Such as households in Pardubice or Hradec Kralove will pay from January for central heating, about 50 crowns a month in addition to more than 1,000 crowns a year will pay the family in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague, there is a risk that them by more than 9 percent rates to go up water and stočné, and in the event that the city will increase the rent of infrastructure.
If the rent of the change, připlatí, roasted 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague, there would still be in celorepublikovém comparison between lower.
In the north Bohemia, where prices are among the highest, already has a Water and stočné podražit by 7.4 percent.
Can significantly, for example, the increase of prices of rent in 450 thousand rental apartments, where from January end of regulation.
, for example, CPI flats, which owns about 2,500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, intends to from January rent increase up to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with a new amount of lease, intends to give the company to court.
Regulated rents that apply to people in about 300 thousand apartments, could rise as much as 10 percent next year.
Czech children opíjejí fernetem and rum. beer is out of fashion, he slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally, better whisky mark stolen parents.
That are drinks, after which drink it in most often end up in the care of doctors drunken men, who were not yet even fifteen years.
Children are not the exception, which repeatedly of the monkey treated in hospital.
This stems from the experience of doctors, who are found on income with similar cases of Children's Department of hospitals.
"Some kind of beer or wine are completely nemódní, because it takes a long time to them opijete."
"The trend is certainly hard alcohol," said the Chief of children's rights of the department of the hospital hořovice in Central Bohemia vice pelikán.
"If they can pull a bottle of daddy of the closet, so it should be a whisky, but otherwise the fernet and vodka."
"vodka has the advantage, that it does not pour into the juice and so many of them then feel," said Chief.
And for the right gives him, a spokesman for the university hospital Motol Eva jurinová.
"Most of all it is a fernet or rum."
"It is now a modern alcohol in particular in primary schools."
"In some cases it was a slivovici, which they brought from home," said jurinová.
According to the chief surgeon's pelikána are 13 or čtrnáctiletí drinkers in the hospital income fairly commonplace.
Before hořovicemi, where they operate from this year, worked for ten years just to specialize in Motol, where ambulances svážejí podroušené school children from miles around.
"One girl was about four times for us."
"career started in 12 years, when it brought to us with 3.5 per mille alcohol in the blood, in combination with the Ecstasy," described the doctor particularly serious case.
"was on the exhibition in holešovicích on some kind of dance party."
"It is interesting that her mother had not crossed special that did not know ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER of 48 hours," said the chief.
Just parents' disregard or even the great tolerance to carousing Their offspring are seen as the main cause of the growth of the child pijanství.
About dependence in the true sense of the word, however, according to experts couldn't talk in children.
"under the concept of an alcoholic means několikaletá chronic dependence on alcohol with all the phenomena, which belong to it, and it isn't in children."
"For those that alcohol use repeatedly, is rather peculiar mythic Greek rodinně-sociální background," he explained pelikán chief.
According to the spokesman jurinové this year at a pediatric clinic in Motol about forty intoxicated children hospitalized in the middle of November.
To the statistics, however, they only get those with heavy intoxikací, which had to stay in the hospital.
Child drunken men following the ambulantním treatment to drive parents, or is home to the police are not counted.
Except when the children just sit up after school and drink a bottle of liquor, according to pelikána, there are three seasonal variations, on which they can do: a witch, the New Year and the end of the school year.
"That either celebrating sorrow for the poor report card, or vice versa celebrating the start of the holidays."
"Of course I experienced in witch on income and seven children's drunks at once," said pelikán.
Drunk who spends a night detoxikací under the supervision of doctors is, paradoxically, the advantage over the fact that the second day at home continued to suffer painful hangovers.
Early headaches caused by dehydration, and the lack of glucose, away irrigation get with the glucose. and nutrients that organisms are missing.
"They are actually better on that, because they have the experience and good for the beautiful awakening and nothing isn't."
"Only the confusion about where it is," he said pelikán, on the pretext that sometimes ruins patients a mood of at least the cost required by their treatment.
For the ambulance and was hospitalized in an acute bed, also comes to tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I applied as educational resource when I'm right then the kids to vizitě said how much of their drunkenness, and that the Brigade could also spend all summer, in order to earn to that of one party," he added pelikán.
Health insurance, according to him, to regresním management, in which the parents vymáhaly the cost of treatment, are not in cases of children's drunks.
The two l-159 are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain
The two l-159 out of a total of five pieces, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense traded transport plane Casa c-295m, on Tuesday it was flung into the Spanish sevilly, where's the aircraft manufacturer - EADS casa.
This is the first time that the machinery of this type were owned by someone other than the Czech army.
Abroad has only been in exercises or s.r.o. years.
It is a dvoumístné version of l-159t1, which has operated the Czech army and that were letuschopné.
The remaining three machines are single l-159.
You are so far zakonzervované in aeru Vodochody and provider of trade - omnipol - Company to take it already last week.
When the aircraft physically vypraví from vodochod, it is not by Jana pejška known so far from the press Department of Defence.
"The single aircraft l-159 were earmarked for shift from aircraft stored in the long run, and that without other deposits and the Ministry of Investment from the resort."
"dvoumístné l-159t1 were exchanged in the current state and form," he said pejšek law.
He added that the army without dvoumístných aircraft will be left, because the Ministry in May 2009 has signed with aerem Vodochody contract worth 200 million crowns for converting the four unnecessary machines l-159 on two dvoumístné machines.
One new plane took the army takes over in July, the second by the end of this year.
According to pejška EADS pledged that the way by aeroplanes in the equipment of some alliance of the country.
"in the Treaty is clearly stated that the consumer l-159 aircraft is the company EADS and will be used to train pilots of the countries of NATO."
"is, therefore, the matter of customer, how this thing will be implemented," he said pejšek.
Economic newspaper some time ago indicated that such as the Spanish army on l-159 not interested.
The exchange of five l-159 for one of the Casa, and last year, the government approved the purchase of another three aircraft worth 3.5 billion crowns mirka topolánka.
The Defense Ministry nevypsalo to buy a tender and addressing directly to EADS.
Then the defense argued that the shift will promote future exports l-159 abroad.
The Czech army, from aera bought 72 airplanes and uses only 24, the rest would like to sell it.
The purchase of aircraft in the casa is likely to have the judicial dohru.
The European Commission, the Czech Ministry of Defense has sued the European Court because the aircraft had selected on the basis of the European tender and not oslovením one producer.
The army has already took over three aircraft Casa, the last in Prague Airport kbely should come within 14 days.
Finger longer than your ring finger means lower cancer risk
Men who have his finger longer than the ring finger, are subjected to decreased the risk that they get sick of prostate cancer.
It is surprising conclusion of the study, which published the British magazine of cancer on Wednesday.
This may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative finger length can serve as a simple test the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for a man in 60 years," she said spoluautorka study eelesová Ros, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Finger so could help determine which men should take the test of prostate cancer, particularly in combination with the genetic risk or other threatening factors, such as the family health burden, she added eelesová.
In the period 1994-2009 followed with colleagues in Britain, more than 1,500 patients over three thousands of healthy men with prostate cancer and in parallel.
More than half of the participants in the study had his finger on his right hand shorter than the ring finger.
Was of the same likelihood of prostate cancer for them as for 19 percent of those whose fingers were exactly the same length.
In the case of those who had his finger longer than the ring finger, but this risk has decreased by 33 percent, for a man in age sixty of the decline even 87 percent.
The ratio of the - shaped by the length of these two fingers prenatal period - probably reflects different levels of sex hormones, which the child is on display in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer forefinger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone supports the growing prostate cancer.
A leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences Professor of Bobby pačes for čtk said that this study slightly knows, but it's not him that he would be the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer was "completely proven."

American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
Put the American army in Afghanistan a new "smart" weapon, known so far only under the code mark xm-25.
Generals are hoping that the new automatic rifle will affect its conflict with the Taliban, and "Change the Game" in their favour.
The new weapon is something like a little superpřesné gun.
Her projectiles, takes laser to within a few yards away.
Special bullets caliber 25 mm, developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive charge, effectively function as small grenades.
Bullets can be programmed to detonate not only in the impact on the target, but at any point of their ballistic careers.
So they can be used against an enemy who is for some obstacle, behind the wall or in the trench.

According to Richard audetta, who contributed to the development of xm-25, is the first new rifle weapons for infantry, which take advantage of the "smart" technology.
"A soldier with her way, in principle, to FIND THE TARGET will send a laser beam, which specifies the distance to him, so he receives upřesněný deliberate adjust point, according to him, bearing and he pulls the trigger."
"Let's just say that you they measured 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the weapon to charge and will deploy missile at distance of 543 meters plus or minus one, two or three meters," he said audette.

Ice cream University
On "gelato university" in boloně preparing zmrzlinoví shepherd did on a better season.
On the basic course for the future zmrzlináře, which lasts three days, there is a great interest and visitors comes from all over the world.
Where is actually takes the ice cream?
From gelatiere and from gelataio.
Gelatiere, Czech a bit of zastarale zmrzlinář, produces cream according to all the rules of the Italian zmrzlinářského art.
Gelataio out stěrkou ice cream from the coolant boxing, setře into her waffles and sold.
You see this, you don't have to go to anzola dell 'Emilia in Bologna province.
But who wants to learn more about ice cream, he will not shirk "gelato-university" Italy's carpigiani.
In 2003, set up a producer zmrzlinových machines were an ice cream University to ice cream from its machines to high Italian ideals everywhere.
On the basic course for the future gelatieri, which lasts three days, is a great interest and visitors comes from all over the world.
Offers, but also a few days' special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in their own zmrzlinárně.
Someone long in their midlife-crisis for a new career, others to weigh on thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the movement of slow-food and I would offer the quality of the product in the industrial ice-cream country in the future.
Anke from Berlin is the Enterprise konzultantka and I would after years spent stressful work to start something of his own.
Two young egypťanky dream of that, in the kairu open zmrzlinárnu.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and Canadian woman in households Julia arrived, because of its Children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explain participants ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Decisive is not only a good taste, but also the silk softness and a good consistency.
Luciano forget during its training to jižanskou and patriotic the cherry on the cake: "the Italian gelato is simply the best - and then this is still notná dose of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano inserts the basic ingredients of whipped cream, milk powder milk, sugar and not to a mixer, which heat all electronic programme in 85 degrees and subsequently just cool to four degrees.
Then turn to the TAP, and comes pasterizovaný white basic cream, the foundation of all types of milk ice creams.
Immediately the Assistant Professor covered with issues: it is possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without stabilizer?
How can a man himself to experiment?
Luciano warns to be carried away the spirit of the time into the unknown.
Who speaks of Ice cream "only from natural ingredients," apparently used the same stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as the guarová flour from guarových grains.
Naturally, it is possible to make ice cream without stabilisers, however, you must sell in one day, otherwise the strike and the same ice of her client.
Some variation of basic matter are vacation.
Suspense that will be with aromatic essences.
Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream in accordance with the additives to buy in the supermarket either in the department with fruit or in the department of sweets.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"suppliers you will seek to impose a lot of aromatized ingredients."
"But you should simply to experiment."
Either with fruit sorbety with sugar and fresh fruit.
Ice cream or from the White basic matter that will change eggs on the yellow cream and a basis for some cocoa chocolate temptation.
Now the rate to an ice cream machine may be involved.
Luciano lets them always produce four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and lískooříškové ice cream - either with or without eggs them in the basic mass, with a more or less with aromatem or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment is carried out with the fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purée - due to the taste that is not always better.
Lískooříšková ice cream may not like it more oříšková if it contains more of the peanuts.
Favorite ice cream from kiwi makes a group, which it will use more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when a balanced mix vyzdvihne right taste gelato, says Luciano.
Production of ice cream is purely computational task: if the peach purée with a lot of sugar is applied, it must be to reduce the share of sugar in the basic recipe.
With citric acid of ice cream is the need for extra slice of sugar.
Luciano out machine, which specifies the sugar content in Fruit By winegrowers by measure cider of grapes.
Fortunately the table facilitate the numbers.
Ice cream production has already does not require so much physical effort as before.
Does not help only machine for the automatic production of basic matter.
There is also a machine that a ready were an ice cream mixture at the same time umíchá into the cream and cool to minus temperature.
Despite all the automation, the inevitable small accidents.
Brazilan Gustavo had dirty themselves and also their colleagues from top to bottom fruit purée huge mixer, when he gets out of control.
"In any rate," does the Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this would happen."
Auditors in two light
The European Food EFSA office is linked with industry, which is experimenting with the genetic plants.
This accusation is now a group of experts testbiotech, which is considered to be an independent institute for the estimate of biotechnology.
"It sounds like spiklenecká theory, but we did well zdokumentovali," said on Wednesday in Munich chief testbiotechu Christoph then.
The leading group of experts EFSA for gentechnicky modified plants, Harry kuiper, and another expert EFSA have a contract for several years with the Union of ilsi lobbies.
It is financed by concerns like Monsanto, Nestle, or Bayer.
Kuiper EFSA was involved in a decisive manner to control rules for genetic plants and is, like, in a clear conflict of interest, has been criticised by then.
EFSA rules they agree in the Entire paragraphs of the documents ilsi and bear and the manuscript of the industry, which should be controlled the authority in the Italian Parma.
It is the second time testbiotech draws attention to the conflict of interest.
Recently went high manager from EFSA without additions or the transitional period to the Swiss agrárnímu concern syngenta - and that changed parties.
Also radio for central Germany, mdr, revealed recently personnel links eu-úřadu for control of industrial lobby, which raised the interest of the Ministry for the Environment, as well as members of the EU.
Meanwhile, it can EFSA to see a conflict of interest.
Working with all serious data, as well as those of the industry, where they are highly trained quality is indicated in a statement.
From the experts who work for the EFSA, are not required to have contacts with industry.
But it is evidence of them.
Kuiper admits its work for International Life Sciences Institute, ilsi in the US.
Itself is referred to as a neutral forum of experts of the science, industry and Policy - in addition to other lobbyists for the assessment of biotechnology risks without the Treaty.
The independent experts criticize as then, that they are currently in holiday gentechnicky modified plants in animals without any attempt to feed, and that the netestuje the reaction of the genetic plants on the effects of the environment.
"We want to know what, for example, will do gentechnicky modified maize in the field," he said then.
The current practice is only test isolated proteins and not the whole of genetic plant, which nedoloží reliable results.
"If they're looking for risk, as it would then be possible to find them?," asked the fingers then.
Here we are in agreement with the Angelika hilbeck.
Scientific worker examines the gentechniku since 1994 and is currently working on technical high school in Zurich.
In this area is trying to industry as well as in the US, now also more and more influence in Europe or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore already almost there are scientists who wouldn't be connected with the concerns.
Most of the nepublikují studies, which are critical to the company.
"Industry controls the security research," it believes hilbeck.
The stones
Uli gsell also took some issued, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night was standing in front of the station in Stuttgart bottle on his back.
Was a demonstration.
Snow.
The story is known: arrived in September bagry and began pulling down a lot of the North end.
The world in Stuttgart has been the same: Thousands demonstrated against s21, miliardovému reduction in the station.
When he has made to stop construction, most of the wings lay in ruins.
Broken to 6000, 7,000 pieces.
The limestone of crailsheimu, soft gross stone, which were used in the years of 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is sculptor in ostfildern, 43 years.
Has secured a few of these pieces.
"The stones are relics."
"must not go away."
Fades: "cheap and poor stone, simple and ambitions."
When one cut, smelled after cigarette smoke.
What about those pieces will do, she didn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli gsell also.
Trail of stones from Stuttgart leads in the woods near tübingen on the former deponii bombs of the French army, where Manuel rongen establish its stone empire.
44-letý man trades with the old stones.
Bought all that arose during the cutting in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if the rozemlely on the gravel or disappeared in the deponii," says in his office, wooden box, which was previously the guard house.
He says he swore and threatened him, when in September in all the papers said that bought the remains of the North End from the company, which is being carried out of the demolition.
But he was for days with s-21 opponents.
And explained that the demolition, not at all.
And when they are going on, then it is only reasonable When the stones continues to use.
Then he took about 200 s-21-protivníků each one about 80 kilograms heavy block, the price of a piece of 6.50 to 14 of the euro.
As a memory, some also in the hope that he will return in the construction.
Rongen bought 500 tonnes, cargo 25 Large trucks.
About half of it is still in the forest, the rest have long sold.
Keen gardeners, krajinní gardeners, home builders.
CAME FROM ALL over and dragged what came in the trunk and on the trailer.
Stones of the dispute of Stuttgart, long a "walls" or as a border, with herbs.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political inserts."
Getting in his field car and was going on the ride after his 20 hektarovém Kingdom.
Studied first rights, the study said, later biology, then was on the computer, and eventually became a trader with stones.
And the lover of stones.
Has saved 40000 tons of stones.
Tied their treasures from all over Germany.
Says that it is the largest trader with old stones in the Republic.
Brakes.
In the snow is artistically worked sandstone.
"once belonged to marien-most in Dresden," he says.
Sandstone from river, yellow, warm, is very excited.
"My favorite stone."
We go further up the road through the forest.
Shows on a pile of: red sandstone, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And on.
"Nice travertine."
Once belonged to the blocks into the stands neckarstadionu in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow is stones and stories, cannstatt-travertin from police prezidia in Stuttgart, red granit Sankt blasien, tuf from the hospital in heilbronnu from the temple.
What job, what kind of effort, what sweat.
When rongen thought of it, as the first manually rozbíjely stones and převážely using simple kladkostrojů and bull vehicles, it will be quite funny.
"It would be a scandal if they were crushed by something."
Inhabitants of the rich, very rich, not at all.
Businessman with stones today but a team of 14 people and, in addition, up in the woods settled down kameníci, a sculptor, one of Smith, one sklář and one of the gardener.
"We work hard, but it is satisfying," says the one who undertaken by remnants of.
In the foreseeable future, must to Cologne.
Also there will save stones.
The fight of talent on high-potenciály
At the hot dog stand there's a lot of people.
16 students is pressing for sandwiches with salmon, tomato soup and Sweets.
Technical University in braunschweigu and car manufacturers Volkswagen invited students mechanical engineering and design of the workshop.
Together with the developers of VW here to talk about the car of the future - and by the way what Volkswagen.
Many companies have to head in the race on the wise thing to do, as well as company VW, to succeed and is betting on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: as soon as possible recruit in posluchárnách most talented graduates, before they get to the labour market and others will be to be concerned about this.
As the University of print no lists the success of their students, trying to find company exceptional talent in projects oriented to practice and get it on.
On the braunschweig is trying to motor concern to obtain the talent of the next day.
One young lady of the personnel department dealing pens, jellybeans and board with the logo VW.
Tells hopeful young talents on the programmes on the practice, the student jobs and suggests them a trip to the group.
Nico selle from the braunschweig is concerned about the project, along with VW.
See benefits for both sides: "Students are in contact with industry and have experience."
"VW may, at the same time, meet students, closer to meet interesting and reconsider the candidates who would be better as a partner."
Such cooperation, according to the selle, are not unusual.
News, however, is that so openly is fighting for the students.
"otherwise was more substantial special project," says selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will be even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer select their employees from the long representatives of candidates.
Must, on the contrary, try and to try to lure especially a highly skilled labor force.
Especially graduates engineering disciplines have an excellent negotiating position.
According to data of the Association of German engineers vdi remained in October compared 40,000 engineering positions.
And according to the forecast vdi 'lack of engineers will only increase.
For KPMG's Audit and consulting firm is Roman dykta on the hunting of talent.
Organized by demanding recruiting-events, such as kpmg-race, kind of modern race for treasure, in which participants must find a way to coordinate thing GPS.
The company plans to send eight such promising students next year after the United States of America.
Participants can also see the branches of KPMG and meet with the company.
In advance to decide in two rounds, who will take part in the selection.
Only crème de la crème from many candidates will proceed to the US.
In the competition on the high potentials at universities will pay according to dykty still tougher laws.
"We want to be with our distinguished from the rest of the race."
"A trip to a sailor was too little for us."
It seems that the talent hunter dykta has luck.
"We stayed in touch with all participants in the similar action in the past year."
"Some will soon end the study and are planned for us apply for a job," he said.
In addition to the direct solicitation on campus, especially small and medium sized companies present classic on the labor markets.
"We are in contact with graduates on professional exhibitions."
"such as intersolar," says sitha stübe, head of human resources of the manufacturer of solar technology solarworld.
The company from Bonn employs about 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows issue with the young workers.
At present, it is listed 35 positions on the website of the company.
"At the current time, it is difficult, to fill the jobs."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is contact over the professors in universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as university in freibergu.
"professors are reporting that it is possible for us to do practice or write my thesis."
Solar specialist does not hold any of expensive advertising.
Instead, is trying to company to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and light communication.
"Large concerns it often cannot offer," said the head of the personnel department stübe.
Play the main role of the money in search of work for a long time.
Flexible working hours, custody of children or good options for the procedure are other relevant factors.
Solarworld it occupied in one study of a great place to work, 55th place among the 100 Best Employers in Germany.
Institute compiles annual list of the best of German employers.
In addition, queries staff, as they are satisfied with his work and the work environment and monitors framework conditions of workers.
The personnel department stübe hopes that her location will bring points for applicants for work.

When the company good care of his people and they identify with the company, then it will be from themselves to publicize his employer between friends and known.
"It is like a game with the string," says kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
Over the next few years will not be at before the coast of us-spolkového Florida State new oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Government in Washington issued the ban - and the cancellation of the final earlier plans.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast of, meanwhile, are new drilling banned.
Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar say it on Wednesday.
The reason for a strict ban, which should be at least the next five years, is the explosion on the drilling rig "deepwater horizon" in April.
Before this accident, which cost 11 employees of life and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the US, President of Barack Obama under pressure from the opposition and industry signaled its willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf.
Advocates of by trying to reduce US dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
To date is not clearly explained, who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The criticism is an energetic concern BP of Britain, which is confronted miliardovými requests.
The commission of inquiry, which gave Obama, should present the results during December.
In October the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar drilling ban, who paid from the explosion.
Subsequently submitted various oil concerns of the application of the new drilling intentions.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster stricter controls and striktními security regulations.
At the time, essentially reforming Control Office, which draw attention to himself many korupčními accusations.
At the same time, Obama announced that cancels a lucrative options for tax evasion for oil and gas groups.
Industry now openly warns that the stricter regulation fundamentally Decreases the volume of crude oil produced in the Gulf.
"The Government plans are the biggest impediment to growth of gas and oil industry" is the result of the survey in the consulting firm bdo - even before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
American Energy Alliance has yet to complain to uncertainty in scope: "No one knows exactly what the regulation to change."
Investment in new mining projects are shifting until further notice - at the expense of the growth.
The ogoni burned
The water in the rivers is olejově Brown, it smells like a gas station: billions of gallons of oil destroyed nature in the ogoni in Nigeria.
People feed on taking, corruption and illegal cooking oil.
Celestine akpobari it means well.
"Do not to" appeases green activist journalists: "Today, you'll receive a lens still enough oil mud."
37-letý nigeriánec followed an attempt of the boy, who is wading through the breasts of water that surround the blur: the scene has been active in the fire with a paints almost too nice.
That beneath the surface go brown oil clots, is not to be seen.
Before there was enough garnel in containers, Esther says badom on the bank of the river bodo-jetty.
Meanwhile, the water has become slowly resulting completely dead.
Five years ago, large quantities of oil spilled into a huge amount of liquid area from the broken leadership.
Fishermen from a nearby town Bodo must paddle at least six hours to get into the waters, where are the fish: ogoni region, which lies in the heart of the Niger River delta belong to one of the worst contaminated areas in the world.
WAY DOWN THE River mangrovníkovými the swamp with the side of tributaries is only detectable the full extent of the trigger.
Engine in the boat's cooking instead of light water brown porridge and who immerse his hand into the water, you pull oil fingers.
Roots mangrovníků rises from countries such as black rods liquorice, rarely occurring palm trees have left their leaves sadly hang.
In vain we're looking for a flock of birds, which normally in the humid areas are: die once the engine on the boat, rozhostí earlier in heaven, where it smells like a gas station, scary silence.
"What is going on here is environmental leadership of the war," says sadly celestine akpobari: "We live in constant fear of health."
Compared with the war was justified.
Settlement Area ogoni is a battlefield, where he is struggling for several decades: more than 60 years ago, I filed the first invaders from Europe, here in the 1980's shape the first, the resistance with later popraveným writer Ken saro-wiwa, there had to concern shell to stop their production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for employees.
Still in the area ogoni the company may not return: while a benefits from all over the area of the delta to triple the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 mining drilling and 7,000 miles of leadership of more than two million barrels of the black gold, lies the oil fields in the ogoni fallow for concern, the situation is too unstable.
Every few hundred metres rises from the water of the steel structure as bizarre statue: "Christmas trees" and are too gently referred to the heads of the drilling holes.
Are 50 years old, most until his rusty.
Every now and again, they break such head vrtného opening, telling akpobari, and then a constant stream of oil into the water.
According to the estimates of experts had to ecosystem in the delta of more than two billion litres in 50 years: each year, the amount of oil that had in a plane crash into the sea at aljašky supertankeru "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disaster in the history of mankind.
There are disputes, who is responsible for the continue of environmental disaster.
While the shell indicates a sabotage and organized the theft of crude oil at more than 90 percent of the pollution, this is nature boy of the environment on the crackling Heads of wells and netěsných lines as the main cause.
Shell in Nigeria requires much less security regulations than it is customary in the world, has accused concern in 2008 us-americký scientist Richard Steiner: only the number of lines disorders is said "several times higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks from a distance as deserted, oil zašpiněná workshop in the open air, emerging from mangrovníků figures: are completely naked and up to its neck from the oil.
Under one of the many drums, which are part of the leadership, and possibly spread all over the country, FIRE FIRE: illegal small refiners.
The barrel over the fire is heating oil for several hours, explains Michael, head of the group.
First comes from the leadership to the záchytného pot petrol, later dripping at the end of the management of kerosene and diesel in the end.
In this way, manufactured Michael and his four colleagues up to four barrels a day after 300 litres: "We're going to make a 34.000 naira" - around 22 dollars.
Delta People take advantage of chronic fuel shortages in the biggest oil state of black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Ridiculously low price of 40 euro cents per litre of diesel illegal producers may even Trump: because they have the raw material for free.
Comes from "bunkerů everywhere," who link in the lead in the field of ogoni: according to the experts, as well as in the whole of the Niger River delta is losing the country at least 16 million litres a day of oil.
But only negligible a small part of raw materials provisionally stored illegally zušlechtí: the largest share of filled with organised criminal networks, to which they have include politicians and senior officials of the army, to tankers and sell it on the world market.
Debate whether caused the disaster of the people and their actions or lax way of production, considers activist akpobari for purely academic.
"If the nepovažovaly oil companies for the intruder and if so perfectly did not destroy the essence of fishermen, then there would have been no sabotage or theft and illegal refiners."

"That cursed thing got our country in all respects to the bottom," says akpobari.

It comes with a horror movie with artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas winding refn is trying to overcome old borders again with an epic of its famous "walhalla rising."
At what audience probably thought the Danish director Nicolas Winding refn when run "walhalla rising"?
Captured vikingský fighter with one eye, mads mikkelsen is free from their torturers and of the big kills almost their opponents with supernatural force - is the ideal for young men viewers who are seeking bloody actions because our hero helps cruel killing methods and your enemies tearing even the guts of the stomach alive, when he's in a bad mood.
On the other hand, jednooký, as in fact is called, during the whole film he won't say a word, and other figures pronesou more than one or two sentences or will be swayed by the strastiplným Dying's.
Otherwise, silent and carousing in an beautiful hung up Scotland, which offers the background to the world of Vikings about a thousand years ago.
Film is more ideal for adult enthusiast movies with an interest in existencializmus and very calm images of the cameras.
Is good, when it has more of the target groups of the film, it's just a shame, when are mutually exclusive.
Director winding refn, after he made a wild and stylizovanou trilogy on drug dealerech "pusher" is considered to be a Danish version director Quentin tarantina, stoically but has resisted, close to their work either more humor on a mainstream or less brutality of artistic audience.
Most of the artistic movies are unlikely to allow discouraged stříkajícím everywhere brain and guts.
Supporters of action films, unudí no later than the time at which the jednooký it goes wild vysvětlitelných reasons, the group of violent Christian missionaries of ships to Jerusalem and will remain hanging for eternity is calm and fog than probably will carry the team to America and there remains silent.
Not, what wonder that in Germany," walhalla rising "Not in movie theaters and now was only released on DVD.
It's a pity mainly due to a záběrům, but also because the specific facade, points to got a blood, hiding exciting cinema, which brought a bit of attention.
In this film is not about dialogue or the exact sequence, everything is the atmosphere, Some dream, which has become the film.
And this is not for the spectator run.
Refn him nedopřeje not an instant and release it slowly strangling their images of the chill and gloomy hypnotickým a video, first of all, but I hate that surge through from the hearts of figures.
Only a small blond boy, which helps jednookému, keep some sort of innocence, everyone else is driven anger.
Most of all jednooký hero, whose motives are never explained that it would be time for enemies and temporary ally warrior from Hell, maybe the envoy of the devil.
Starring the destruction, perhaps, but also only for those corrupt.
"walhalla rising" is a mysterious film, which it is possible to hate and admire for angry, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious natural work
Nuclear Energy Authority the IAEA has a new warning on a secret nuclear program in Syria.
Country but has resisted terms - and even allow control.
Around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007 they attack at least four Israeli combat aircraft f-15 and mysterious square building in Syria.
Is on the euphratu; the more city is remote 30 kilometres, and his name is Dair as-saur.
In the work of the International Office for Nuclear energy by the IAEA is her name, when it comes to the reactor, which allegedly put up Syria with the help of North Korea in this square schovaném in the valley to turn from the current.
Us-americké foreign secret services of the CIA on the basis of the communication from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the village el-kibar, work well for the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build a nuclear weapon.
Technology from the 1950s, no good for anything else.
The CIA has presented video with nezaostřenými satellite imagery.
Using the computer animation clarify where reactor components which before the destruction could be, he's got to be a diminishing in his copy of the North Korean model of nuclear center yongbyon.
Indeed, they were still the presentation of photos that showed the building close or even from within.
The reactor was supposedly shortly before running, but still without fuel cells.
Now, after more than three years after the bombing, we don't know a lot more than that, even the riddles of further increased over time.
Earlier us-prezident George W. Bush recently in his memoirs released that the CIA was before the attack a lot of certain that Syria is building in el-kibar reactor, but in fact had no evidence that the country is "active nuclear weapons program."
Some of the reporters of the secret services in Europe are even more cautious and speak only about "Alleged reactor," even when the presentation of the CIA as "hodnověrnou."
They lack clear evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how he was certain that is ahead of the reactor, said in the summer of high UN diplomat, the IAEA has enough material for "ask the questions," he said.
The rubble allegedly "unused military buildings" was syřany quickly while odklizená and also properly zarovnali terrain.
Yet has been found in June 2008, IAEA team under the leadership of the former chief inspector Olli heinonen in el-kibar traces of uranium, which was made by human beings.
In addition, received the IAEA over the Member State of the satellite photos of the commercial vendors from the period just after the attack, which should be better than those that presented the CIA.
Unfortunately, are not the film on the market, because it is exclusively bought unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
IAEA so it cannot confirm their identity.
Syria has always claimed that she had never a secret nuclear program, and even nestavěla reactor.
Uranium came from Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
But it showed the IAEA after analysis particles.
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss the issue - as well as satellite shot.
In addition to revizorům a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the wreck of rozbombardované building.
But also Israel stubbornly silent.
"We'll never comment on that," said recently the official opinion at the time of the ruling Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case is so dragging without result from June 2008 and "is growing into a serious problem in view of the credibility of the authority," as high Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna said - after all, it is a serious violation of the Treaty for the Prohibition of nuclear weapons, which supervises the IAEA.
The IAEA is regarded as the key to stepping up in affairs of another three facilities, to be "in a viable link" with the alleged reactor - and, unlike him, still exist.
Auditors, but so far did not declare, and not a device that is or how they function or why they are suspected.
According to the information newspaper süddeutsche zeitung is the IAEA internally referred to as the marj as-sultan, masyaf and iskandariayah derived again according to nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, isis identified these objects and found on the satellite pictures of the complex of buildings, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
Perhaps is located inside or in the immediate vicinity of military bases - it is for this reason that Syria rejects IAEA access to these three points.
In Vienna said that to haul afraid of a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent to the US in advance, to hunt down military bases.
Nuclear detectives were notified of the device, the US Secret Service.
IAEA has material and also the satellite pictures, that between the three places and the square in euphratu transported material here and there.
A Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the furnished should be "in relation to the production of fuel."
But there is "no evidence of senzibilních activities," the uranium enrichment, and the new processing; processes, which are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
Although the type of reactor is driven by enriched uranium, which is not.
Where but the uranium came from and where should split of him later plutonium for a bomb, there are only likely estimates on the central issues.
Also it is not known whether the debris that could contain important clues, are stashed in the three places.
Like hundreds of the cost of freight wagons disappeared from the face of the Earth, no one does not seem to have information, where the rubble has received.
Only a few kilometres from el-kibar remote and, on the other hand, euphratu The salt mine al-tibni, who left Syria to check in 1998 as a suitable warehouse for radioactive waste, considers the IAEA to be unlikely.
An earlier IAEA inspector Robert kelley put it in connection with the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for a renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
Pictures from space but show that after the IAEA requested access by Syria on all suspected locations of natural work and the large containers.
Could be a coincidence, but that didn't work to clarify the suspicion.
In addition, speak the diplomatic circles about the fact that the IAEA had spent many months of the formation of the plan for revizory, which would have allowed Syria keep any military secrets - only that effort shows how big it is of interest revizorů.
Meanwhile, Damascus refused this proposal, too.
If even a year ago uklidňovali Western diplomats in Vienna, that is after the destroyed reactor, and therefore, the US ambassador to this thing doesn't burn, speaks for several months glyn Davies of the special inspections, which is one of the harshest means that the Vienna nuclear has the authority to enforce the checks.
IAEA chief yukiya amano, who would have to propose the inspections, while already talked about "options, to which the kloním" in the future, so far but hesitate.
This option offers a great risk: on the one hand, there is the need for a majority in the Board of the IAEA and much of represented 35 countries has definitely interested in an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out: "What's going to happen when, in the end, they don't find anything?"
Love in the Time of War
Since Angelina had Jolie began in the summer to work to control prvotině, still anonymous, there was a problem.
She wrote the script, it is a love Story Women from Bosnia and the man from Serbia.
About many more did not know it, but that, too, is causing unrest.
Continue to speak about the fact that the woman who is a Muslim, falls during the war in Yugoslavia to the Serbian man who raped her.
Bosnian Women's groups immediately protestovaly, so the hastily shifted planned shooting from the Sarajevo to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film in Hungary dotočil and it is in postproduction Center, in bosensku, but still objects.
Bakira hasecic from the organization of women's war victims wrote over un-organizace to help refugees UNHCR Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, now informed Bosnian paper - Jolie is also the Ambassador un-organizace to help refugees.
Is not just diplomatic - offered women already weeks ago a meeting in Hungary, which but rejected.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, said hasecic.
In kempech, where znásilňovalo, love stories take place and Jolie's position towards the victims reveals enough about the script.
So her organization recommended un-organizaci to help refugees to release Jolie as Ambassador, shall inform guardian.
Exactly what scene Jolie wrote?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given to read her script, relaxed after the smaller tahanicích shooting in Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why then Jolie still did not arrive.
Young Author stresses that no political intentions followed in his film that with a great deal of effort on the subject of conflict in Yugoslavia, that wants to show the terrible consequences of war and to give room to all of the parties involved.
In view of the content remains vague.
There are one more on the Internet version of the film, which is really quite different: Lovers are already knew before the outbreak of war and to meet again when she is as Bosnia's Muslim zavlečená to Serbian camp, where he serves as The Guardian.
That really is a lot different than "the rape victim falls in love with his tormentor."
The fact that the film Jolie really starts before the war - is true.
Jolie argues that it is up to her come under pressure, which "is not fair and is based on false information."
Now she can go free it's hekeři from Hollywood: by publishing illegally on the Internet its scenario, as it had done many times.

Charge even by 2015 with 200,000 emigrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million people that is a major loss.
If the predictions confirms, there will be a wave of similar expatriate, what protrpělo Ireland in the 1980s.
After decades of the increase, which brought about the Irish people of great prosperity, is now once again extends neutěšenost.
Economic crisis znejišťuje mainly young, educated the Irish, who have experienced only rise.
The loss of Employment and Social descent seemed to be in these years of boom absurd.
The need for everyone was money was tight.

About what it is to create something somewhere else, he knows for half a year seán about 'donovan.
Because 29-letý engineer had no work in Ireland, is now busy, together with 15 Irish colleagues at the building in Germany.

Fear that it could go wrong on the farewell party.
"mainly no emotion," says and drinks a good beer.
"Goodbye, yet it is alarmingly."
"Call it celebrating the departure, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Common practice of democracy
The promotion of democracy in Latin America is rising, as well as support for the private business.
Crime is of greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil many regions it considers more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the survey latinobarómetro, which took place in 18 countries and came exclusively in the magazine The Economist.
As the poll is being held on a regular basis since 1995, that may follow changes in their attitudes across the area.
In this year's survey, which was held in September and at the beginning of October, is dominated by two related things.
The first of them is that Latin America has quite a happy mood.
The second is to increase the stability of the attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Promotion of democracy in a number of countries on the edge of the Pacific has risen significantly in South America, see Table 1.
In Peru, where, for example, since 2002, economic growth of 6 percent per year on average, support for democracy of the minimum 40% in 2005 rose to 61% in the current year.
Also increased in Mexico, where the economics convalescent after deep decline of production in the last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are believed Democrats, which is the regional average, see chart 2.
About 44% of the respondents across the areas cited the satisfaction with the way in their country of democracy works in practice, this is about the same number as in the last year, but compared to 2001, when it was about 25%, it is a big increase by 3 graph.
Some 34% said that they trust the Council in his country and 45% of the trusts government, once again, this is about the same number as in the past year, but it is a big difference compared to the year of 2003 by 17% and 24%.
Ten years ago, the economic crisis undermined democracy in Latin America.
Aid was established during the world financial crisis is likely on the grounds that many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, stronger network of social security to protect the poor people.
The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, announced this week that the ratio of Hispanic living in poverty has increased only slightly in 2009 and this year dropped to 32% again.
But the mood change in a wide range of from country to country, see chart 4.
Strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President Luis Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in the widely widely acclaimed sense of progress.
This situation is rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and increase the violent crime.
For only the second time since they came to carry out surveys, sees more respondents across Latin America as the most important problem of crime rather than unemployment, see chart 5.
About 31% said that either they or their close relatives became victims of crime in the last year, but this is a drop compared with the figure of 38% of last year and it is also the lowest number since 1995.
Masivnější economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of the respondents across the area says that it is necessary for the development of private enterprise, this percentage has increased from 56% of the year 2007, see chart 6.
About 58% agree with the fact that the market economy is the only system that will allow the development of their country, this percentage has increased from 47% from last year.
It is interesting that 62% of the respondents in Venezuela has the same opinion, and 80% there supports of private enterprise, although their leftist president Hugo Chavez vyvlastňuje many private companies.
Brazil is the country that has a leading position in the area, as have mentioned the 19% of the respondents, compared to 18% in the last year, followed by the United States, 9%, unchanged from last year, and the Venezuela - 9%, compared to 11% in the last year
However, the United States are considered as the most influential country respondents in Mexico and in large parts of Central America, while Venezuela has enjoyed success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticised elections
No one expected them to the general elections will be in Haiti on 28 November perfect.
But they were much worse than the outsiders, who are trying to help the country to be afraid.
Elections gave performing the ballot box and repeated the vote, the ballot papers rozmetané after channels, broken electoral room and intimidation.
Polling stations open after hours of delay.
Many haiťanů, including many přestěhovaných because of the January earthquake, the potulovalo around and trying to find out where they can go to vote.
Some of them, it gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including a number of the expected předběžců shouted that this is a fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, some of them violent nature, spread all over the country.
Still, Edmond mulet, a senior official of the United Nations in Haiti, said that "in many ways it was a pretty good election."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, said that "they do not believe that these irregularities, whether they were however serious, not necessarily to process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose Opposition votes are committed to René prévalovi, nepopulárnímu odstupujícímu president and his candidate Jude célestinovi, is to announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The decisive battle is scheduled for January.
All electoral hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates Michel martelly, rapper and mirlande manigat, the former First Lady, backed away from their original challenges that the vote be declared invalid.
But the problem can occur if Mr. célestin, who has little or negligible support among voters, will be marked by the Electoral Commission for the fact that reached a decisive contest.
Because of řádící a cholera epidemic, and more than 1 million people, who still live in tents after the earthquake, there was a concern that voter turnout will be low.
In the end, many haiťanů to vote, but because of the dezorganizace prevented them from doing so.
Around 250 thousand of the identity cards, which are essential for the vote, undistributed remained shortly before the elections.
A lot is at stake.
Donors see the choice of legitimate and popular government as a key step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And thus it is clear that the Haitians will place themselves.
Come on to the center
Profit in the weeks when she is suddenly widowed, cristina from in, the Argentine President, from the public sympathy, when its popularity has grown from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since it was elected in 2007.
Yet Reversing this success in the successful campaign for a second term in office in next year's elections may depend on whether the grieving renounces Mrs fernándezová nekompromisnosti her late husband, a predecessor and political partner néstora kirchnera.
, and everything will be based on these characters.
Mr Kirchner, who said in economic policies, as well as after his wife successfully became a president, was in the habit of budgeting that downgrading tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This has allowed the first couple spend more revenue as you want.
Mrs fernándezové government lost a majority in Congress in the last year.
But the opposition is divided and has been further destabilised in the death of Mr kirchnera of a heart attack on October 27.
Some members of the ruling political movement peronist is added to the From in.
But after the chaotic meetings, on which some of the hitting and accusing the government of corruption, Congress has failed to approve the budget for the year 2011.
"I am not going to argue," the President said.
The budget for the year 2010 will now also apply to the next year, with the president will have more space their spending of choice.
Economy is overly overheating: this year, it is likely growth to 9%.
The official rate of inflation is now at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists talks about the number, which is close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by a economic collapse, set a priority on growth and poverty reduction, rather than to control inflation.
The private sector has refused to deal with the IMF, zatěžoval and cleanse indec, statistical agency, which came on the monitoring of the official inflation statistics.
The President can now fernándezová moderate this policy?
Called for negotiations between private enterprises and trade union leaders.
And its officials say that they want to limit wage growth in the next year to 18%.
Economy was supported by the growth of world prices for Argentine exports of agricultural products.
But inflation has growth, based on a large devaluation in 2002.
This may be one reason why the President fernándezová gives to know that wants to restore the Argentine financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the Government has established an agreement with bond holders, who previously rejected the restructuring of the debt, which Argentina paid in 2001.
Madam president faces fernándezová agreement with creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which owes roughly $6.7 billion dollars.
Kirchners always insisted on the fact that this is not in sight of the IMF, as it is common.
But last month amado hut, economy minister announced that the fund will provide "technical assistance" to be designed a new national spotřebitelsko-cenový index, which will resemble an introduction to the cleaning indec.
It is still unclear whether the president fernándezová he wants to stay in politics after the end of the term, when a husband is not at her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to win the support of the middle class, which is tired kirchnerismem.
At the time of the return of argentinců from the summer vacation, which are in March, will be a wave of sympathy to decline.
If he wants to win the next elections, it will have to decide whether it will not be necessary quietly to forgo many of the views held by her husband in politics.
Half of encouraging for China
Taiwanští voters are closer to closer links with the mainland.
What the Taiwan thinks about his big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible voted for 27 November, the mayor and City Council in five urban constituencies, which may be considered a broader evaluation of President Ma ying-jeou.
President Ma itself is a representative of prevailing on the mainland, and they have a strong putting in business relations, including the agreement on the part of free trade, in the biggest adjustment in relations with China since 1949.
President Ma has passed the test, but only just.
Although his party kuomintang, KMT, ended a prize of three of five offices of mayor, failed to win a majority of the vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party, the DPP, which is in favour of greater independence of Taiwan, received nearly 50% of votes against 45% of the KMT party.
If this were a presidential election, should President Ma problem.
Since he was elected two years ago, the proportion of votes of his party decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party together with the KMT in urban councils.
Elections took place as the majority of Taiwan elections that include the noisy election trucks and mass assembly with the flags of the oděnými girls.
Part of an assassination attempt was even the compulsory mysterious.
Sean lien, the son of a lien Chan, an honorary chairman of the KMT, the KMT was canvassing for candidates on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot Young Mr lien purely on the face, hurt it and killed the spectator.
Bizarrely has not been specified, whether he had ozbrojenec intend to hurt the liena or settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any case, tsai ing-wen, the head of the DPP, says that shooting affect the elections, suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters toward the KMT.
Perhaps the only China was the big winner of the campaign.
As remained in the background of the issue of the land itself was remarkable.
Instead, candidates were tilting about the plans for the state housing construction and job creation.
Taiwan he usually uses its de facto independence and hates China's military threats.
The KMT has a tendency to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also dropped from vzbuzování anti-čínských positions.
It is a response to the reality and the awareness of that China's trade is essential to the economic survival of Taiwan.
President Ma for his party, confirmed that China's policy is acceptable for the majority of Taiwan.
From the government in Beijing, it can be expected that will continue in the commercial bribes, along with their strategy to Taiwan lured back into the herd.
China lose time to send negotiators to taipeje to set Summit on the protection of investments and medical cooperation.
He would also like to see political integration, but one at a time.
On it will be better to wait until after the presidential elections in the year 2012.
DPP party in any case appeared itself.
Two years ago, was on the wrong level: its former leader, Chen shui-bian, was sent to prison on charges of corruption.
The President in 2000-08 was a troublemaker and a proponent of clear independence.
But, under the leadership of Mrs tsai developed the new generation, which is moderate and the DPP is working hard on it, to bring the experts and young people.
Mrs tsai was provolávána as the DPP list to the President, such as Su tseng-changem, who took office under the chenem.
Their party now has been doing everything in order to show that also can cooperate with Beijing.
Mrs tsai published plans for research institutes, which serves as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without previous conditions.
Mrs tsai tells taiwanské public that her party is "a credible alternative" to the MA hurried approach to China.
Mr. Chen appears to be angry this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell expressed the view that the DPP candidates would be a better place if insisted on the fact that Taiwan is a separate country.
Even ordered the Su, pragmatikovi not to stand for president.
But even without the intervention of Mr chena DPP will fight on the choice between potential candidates.
The KMT is authorized to find their own people.
The evaluation of the MA was bad, and despite the rapid pace of economic growth; candidates KMT wouldn't go with him to the campaign.
His unpopularity seems to be mainly based on unemployment and widening the gap between rich and poor.
KMT spokesman says that přeorganizuje his Cabinet, as well as local branches.
Strongly promoted by the proposals are limited to support Taiwan for a rapprochement.
At the same time, it considers that the majority of Taiwan's citizens economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio chianga, the top publicisty," the point from which there is no return has passed."

Critics attacked the project that promotes terrorism and will lead to the suspension of trade.
However, the judges decided Wednesday night, that a new religious center is in accordance with local laws and will be aesthetically impressive.
"A lot of good people came to support this project - Christians, Jews, on whom you remember," he said nael snakes, Chairman of the Islamic Center in temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.

"It means that justice will always prevail."
"The opposition is minimum," he added.
"Those who are against the only loud shout."
"We have really good people in our valley."

The microbes with resistance to arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
Discovery of strange bacteria, which can use the arsenic as one of its nutrients, widening the scope for the search for new forms of life on Earth, and perhaps even further.
Researchers discovered unusual bacteria here on earth, and claims that it is a sign that life is the option that is outside the main elements, which has so far been considered to be fundamental.
"This organism has double capacity."
"Growth may either because of phosphorus or arsenic."
"This is very strange, but it is not proof that this is a form of really 'alien' life," on this fact, Paul C. W. Davies, of Arizona State University, spoluautor report that appeared in a Thursday in the online edition of Science Magazine.
Long has been considered necessary for the life of the six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
Scientists find, however, that the bacteria, discovered in the Mono Lake in California, are able to continue in growth after a arsenic will replace phosphorus.
"Will you wonder what everything is still possible," said Ariel D. anbar from Arizona State University, spoluautor report.
This finding is important for searching for life outside the country, as researchers need to be able to recognise the life and to know how life can be, he said anbar.
The study focuses on the microbes found on Earth.
However, the report published on this news, to be put to the discussion that betrayed the details of the award, has caused widespread speculation on the Internet, the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
Discovery "shows that the other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that the elements that we consider to be 'standard', may not be so absolutely necessary for life," said Charles cockell, a professor at planetary and space science research institute, the Open University, in Milton Keynes, Britain.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element of the other in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," he added cockell.
It wasn't random award.
Felisa wolfe-simon from astrobiologického Institute at NASA, who led the study, has focused on the Mono Lake, since it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she thought that the microbe that is subject to the two elements may be able to replace the one for the other.
"poisonous arsenic is mainly because its chemical behavior of phosphorus is very similar."
"The result is that the organisms can very hard to these elements from each other."
"However, arsenic is so different that, just as phosphorus is not working. If they get to the organism, anbar starts work in biochemical processes," he explained.
Scientists gather the bacteria known as gfaj-1 and expose is increasing the concentration of arsenic, which are able to adjust to the bacteria and growth.
Microbes grow better at of phosphorus, but in view of the fact that they can survive also with a refund arzenem, increases the possibility that the form of life, which uses arsenic, can be naturally, either elsewhere in the country or to another planet and/or month, where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, is not new, but never found an example, in which it is this fact was achieved.
Arsenic was more common in the old days in the country, she said, and so the scientists have speculated that it could use previous forms of life.
"It suggests that could be other ways to create a life, not only in the way the created in the early period of the country," said Foster, who was not part of the research team wolfe-simona.

"An external quality must first show that then determine next, among them height, weight, features of the face, and so on."
Then comes the nature of and "internal quality."
Women are like flower vase, he said, adding," In addition to the fact that they will vázami, will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng lihua, Deputy Director of the district of the city, the power does not agree with this description.
But suggests that the height requirements are common in China for other posts, and it for both sexes.
As well as a request to geometric name features of the face.
Which means that the issue of good appearance is the subject of discussions between the Chinese.
Disabled or crippling certainly does not apply.
"cannot accept that with us served lame or a man," said Mr. zheng.
"His image would not be good."
Liu Yi, which holds a patrol in baoguang square in the vicinity of the monastery, has 22 years, faces like apples and gently formed his mouth.
Do not consider that the emphasis on her appearance could have a sexist nature, she said.
"Do you think that in this uniform look sexy?" she asked, ironically look.
Her collaborator with dimples, 21 Xu Yang says "Our task is to represent the image of the city."
They do not object to his limited performance, said, because their career ambitions are bigger than only against traders in the streets, where they can carry out their work.
Every morning is a group against more than 10 trhovcům who are running on foot or on wheels and trying to sell as much as possible knedlíčků and dishes tofu before they are expelled.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We have already said it many times!" said Miss Xu, when he started trhovec run on time, and left his round with a cart with noodles.
Police describe their obligations as more monotonous than difficult.
"Every day it is essentially to do the same thing," she said huang Jing, 20, which studies in its own time marketing.
"The routine."
One of the reasons is that women do not have the powers of a state trooper as their male counterparts, so that they can to confiscate goods retailers.
Can only threaten, the fact that report their male director.
The trend is then to protect them from by sudden public expressions of hostility against official system, which are common in the framework of the whole of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in kunmingu, the capital of the province yunnan, rebelled after the spread false rumors about the fact that the policemen killed a.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the hours of darkness; 14 government vehicles was reversed or zapáleno.
Xindu so far such violence escaped.
But peace can only be guaranteed barely.
Only two blocks from the quiet baoguang square, where that morning should watch a state trooper, with more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Police seized a motorcycle, who was in the place inside the store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the round as he could cry.
15 a minute of distance from the police, in the guise of angry, with elbows against vehicles and quickly away with a motorcycle and its owner.
Li xuedong, 40, coordinator of the přičleněný to male group, remained behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
As well as women's a state trooper, coordinators are men over 40 years of age, who already have only a helping role.
Unlike them are not learned in the maintenance and smoothing the image.
"Sometimes we're fighting verbally."
"Sometimes we're fighting physically," said Mr. Li on its own merits.
"Mostly it's the public, that you will begin with this."
Prosecutors will not blame Senator ensigna
Department of Justice prosecutors cleared Senator John ensigna from criminal charges, which covered his affair with the former adviser for the campaign and his efforts to ensure the lobby, the senator lawyers announced on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. ensign, nevadský Republican, and who was, until the scandal, regarded as a possible Republican candidate for president for the year 2012. His affair has risen to national headlines and damaged his career.
Authority of Mr ensigna said that the decision was that followed nearly a year of investigation," certainly pleased."
Senator could still face disciplinary action for the ethics of the Senate.
Lawyers of Mr ensigna said that the Ministry of Justice "informed us that the senator ensign will no longer be the aim of the investigation and that there is no plan to make more charges against him in this matter."
The Justice Department to the case refused to comment.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, who claimed that there is clear evidence of the fact that Mr. ensign prepared breaches of the ban on federal lobbying.
The talks, email and other documents, which were published in October 2009 in the New York Times reported that the ensign helped douglasu hamptonovi, one of his assistants, ensure the lucrative Lobby, which should lead to the silence of Mr hamptona and his wife, cynthie, on senátorově relationship with her.
Mrs hamptonová once worked as a cashier in the campaign ensigna.
Mr. ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr hamptona and support their views after Mr hamptona employed to give the documents and interviews loboval, so much for them.
Since he was hampton recently, assistant of Mr ensigna, was been excluded from the law from lobbying his former employer or Senate for the year.
On ethics experts argue that the unusual settlement of Mr ensigna and Mr hamptona, who have been in front of the aférou friends, appeared in the lobbying against the ban.
"From the evidence, which have been published, it became clear that it is a clear case of violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defence of clients who are investigating the government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the matter of the senator ensigna, the brand and other lawyers specializing in ethics said that the Ministry is cautious with regard to the political actions, after a large number of failures, including the decision last year to suspend actions against former senator tedu stevensovi amid accusations of failure by the Public Prosecutor's office.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hid weapons," she said melanie Sloan, executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington; a law group, which was lodged in the subject of several complaints against the ensignovi.
"It shows in the nature of to the fact that on high ranking government officials is not covered by the law," she added.
Paul coggins, the chief lawyer of Mr ensigna, said in an interview that he called on Monday State representative of the Ministry of Justice and, consequently, then the next day, and told him that the Ministry of neshledalo no charges against his client.
Obhajovací team of Mr ensigna cooperating with prosecutors in an effort to convince them that the senator, as repeated his office in the Wednesday statement," acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. coggins refused to specify the legal arguments that handed State representatives.
"Me is not pleasant know the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice in addition to that we think that they made the right decision," he said.
Last month the Federal Election Commission has decided to stop the investigation into a separate complaint, in which ethical group gives the charge that the payment of parents ensigna hamptonům of 96,000$ violated the federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said it didn't have enough evidence to show that the money meant nothing other than a gift.
One Company, for which the ensign helped find Mr hamptonovi lobbistickou work, NV energy company, was the main nevadská company, which has long supported the senator.
One an email from December 2008 proved that after Mr. hampton in society began to act as a lobbyist, head of the staff of Mr ensigna - John Lopez - communicated with Mr hamptonem and told him that "thumping" in the Ministry of Interior on the disputed course.
Mr. ensign, also took part in lunch with Mr hamptonem and other nevadským client, allegiant air and called on the Minister of Transport, to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airlines after hire Mr hamptona to lobbistickou work.
When the last year for the first time a report on the affair, Mr. ensign to apologize to voters and resigned from his duties as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After mnohaměsíční stagnation of Mr. ensign two weeks ago that it plans to take part in the third term in the Senate, he told reporters.
In the report that Mr. ensign is no longer the aim of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper said that the senator hopes that the ethics committee will be quickly followed by the justice ministry and will put an end to the investigation.
"Senator ensign is looking forward to continuing their hard work in the name of the nevadského people," she said further.
Challenge of the commune Cheshire is turning to Twitter
In the ranks of the courtroom of half a dozen wrote.
Minute by minute issue a report on a horrible testimony over Twitter.
In the end, the defense says that more than 140,000 reports on Twitter in rape and přivazováním children to their beds in the house, which has been a.
On Thursday, the trial was held Steven J. Hayes, who was sentenced for killing three citizens Cheshire, Connecticut, family, and should be the official end to the imposition of the death penalty, for which the jury voted.
But Mr Hayes's lawyers have already submitted the appeal with the court requests and the arguments that the court would probably was years.
One of the nejprovokativnějších is that intensive reporting on the process of - including the widespread use of the twitter reporters - created "a circus Atmosphere" and this common, immediate entry information with pobuřujícími details then introducing the jury in the decision in terms of the effect on public opinion.
This claim could force the judge to address the issue of whether with the new technologies of not requiring the new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced in this trial, I think that there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for the individual," said Thomas J. ullmann, the main defender of Mr Hayes.
Judge in the Jon C. Blue head of state court briefly refused the claim on the return of last week and the fact that the media were "carefully controlled," and that there is no evidence that would show that the jury has acted under the influence of the public.
But it is not likely to be the last word in this case.
For decades the courts they admitted that the news notoriously known cases may cause questions about the justice process.
The Supreme Court of the United States in the regulation of the year 1966 struck down condemnation clevelandského chiropraktika, Dr. Sheppard itself for the murder of his wife, when said in his decision that, in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, the process because of the media were a "karnevalovou atmosphere."
Some believe that this crime was an inspiration of a television show and the movie "the fugitive."
Some lawyers said the appeals courts to review hayesův judgment about half a century later, could be surprised the argument that the new rules might be necessary to determine the way of communication from the judicial halls, which was in the case of Dr. Sheppard unimaginable.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of the new media" in the highly controlled cases, said John J. donohue III, professor of law the Stanford Law School, who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report, which said that possibly be exercised.
Professor donohue said that some of the judges may be pleased with the idea that restrictions on the immediate communication from the judicial Hall can make the process fairer.
Twitter case is only one of the many lawyers outlined by Hayes, who would be able to argue years to row remained behind.
Advocates also says that, for instance, in the case of Mr Hayes blue may be the bias when the judge refused to allow him to test the reaction of the potential jurors by them during jury selection will show criminal photos's creepy.
Some of the judges said that the photographs of the victims were horrified, which has become Jennifer hawke-petit, 48, and her daughter, Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
Advocates say that also refuse to ústavnost the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly dismissed juror, who has been critical of the state's representatives and that its decision incorrectly assumed a more pressure on the jury's verdict and route, to been thinking over the weekend.
Jurors were separated.
But their arguments on the influence of the extent of the process can attract the greatest interest.
Said in the statement of objections against the verdict vzneseném last month, that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was being discussed during the election campaign of candidates for governor and the Senate of the United States.
Argued that the media constantly rozdmýchávaly the flames of emotion in the matter of the case.
"Day of the media, cameras and reporters before the Court," lawyer wrote, "was something here in New Haven, has not yet been to see and this is perhaps also on the national raritu."
Their focus on the twitter is controversial.
In the talks, some journalists claimed that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the report referred to later and from their point of view should follow the scope of the judicial police other processes.
But some lawyers demanded appeals courts often used with arguments that the social and technological changes require the adaptation of the courts.
Mr Hayes's lawyers seek this right.
In his archives referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of the 1966 IN THE MATTER of the Dr. Sheppard, because of the scale of the operation of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media required by the new rules.
"This case," wrote, "is a case of Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century."
Politeness can overcome the gap?
Following the campaign, which was remarkable for its urážlivostí and negativismem, this week in Washington, there were small amounts of courtesy.
This is a good sign of true cooperation of the two political parties or only iluzivní moment before a quick return to the party of the fight in the capital?
The President's and parliamentary leaders Tuesday produced no major discoveries on the crucial issues, which must be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, but it was a polite discussion regarding the views of the differences of the two parties, as well as the definition of their common responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party contest.
Wednesday the public session of the President's deficit of the Commission was also civilized, and despite political differences that remain between Members.
It seems that it is clear that the close cooperation for several months forged mutual respect, which exceeds the ideological divide that Members still divides.
And it is quite difficult to claim that started a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in the test period - sondují each other signs of the company and compromise, while trying to evaluate the borders of public opinion and the electoral patience toward renewed Party War.
Because it was also Tuesday negotiations and his later evaluation of the participants, carried out with the minimum requirements or accusations.
Philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too large and too deep to propose a rapid change in conditions that are there for the last two years.
Whether it is a question of taxes, spending, health care or the rights, the two parties are a mile away.
However, the November election got Washington at least quickly.
"The question is not whether Regulatory Affairs has changed," said Pete wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"You are inevitable after the election.
Elections raised emotions straníků and then you utichli.
It's good."
In several issues, especially those that have to discuss at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats, have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cuts expired at the end of the year and no one does not feel that this is positive.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, and it permanently or temporarily.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits only because the Republicans may not look at how supporting the tax cuts for the wealthy, while the unemployed refuse to support in unemployment.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House is already see greater optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, together with the ratification of a new opening of the Treaty.
But William galston of brookings institution points out that the successful cooperation on the fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship of the two political parties, when 112 Congress convened in January.
Rather, it is likely the disagreements, or even inevitable, he said.
"Then, as do the things that needs to be done, the psychology return to one of the confrontations in the short term," said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is to a large extent extended - the courtesy will lead is real cooperation.
"I'm looking at all what happens between now and the year 2012 as The Shadow Box when major events occur in 2012," he said.
Reasons to a large extent is linked to compiling the new Republican majority in the White House and voters tea parties, who helped to create it.
Republican leaders now facing dangers of exaggeration, they know that they must act according to its promises and must reduce spending of the government and to cancel a new law on health care.
These přívrženecké lines are clear in the initial reactions to the recommendation on the deficit, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase of certain taxes, raise the retirement age and cut costs.
Common Presidents Alan Simpson and erskine Bowles have taken to have one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to his opinion, to put pressure the deficit to public Programme in ways that cannot be ignored.
But need 14 votes in 18 členné to the Commission in order to present his plan as an official recommendation and fought so that they came near to this number as far as possible.
The resistance is between the elected officials of the jury who proposed that in the case of financial issues we have, at least today, small bases or the will to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and the parliamentary Republicans.
The first will start next year in the form of party conflicts, when Republicans encourage Obama to the solution of the budget, taxes and health care, when more party will follow the period of cooperation.
What will drive shift?
Public opinion.
There are a lot of evidence that, despite the partisanship during the last elections, a majority of Americans want to continue to see the two sides to work together.
If the stalemate could go to, as was the case in 1995, then both sides will be very carefully monitor the public reaction.
Anyone would risk reduction of the vote, probably going to change course and will be looking for a compromise.
That may be an optimistic view on the matter.
Stranickost and guidelines are more today than it was in the 1990s, and it turns out that there was greater ideological divide between Obama and parliamentary Republicans than it was in the case of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see the year 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, courtesy, which appeared this week, would want many Americans.
It will be the state but a lot of efforts on both sides, to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Vyzrazený American document portrays Moscow as a refuge of corruption
The management of the city is in the hands of "kleptocracy checked" and it is part of the bribes and bribes for protection, which are the way to kremlinu, she gave US Embassy in Russia in the records of February.
Police and federal security service to a large extent on the wings, which help explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
Recover money not only for legal business but also from the organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "The Office" - will take their, when the money going to move up the ladder.
A record that was sent to Washington under the name of ambasadora John beyrleho, was made public through WikiLeaks on their website on Wednesday.
Record is based on the resources, whose names were redigována.
Record was written at a time when he was mayor of still Yuri luzhkov, accusing him of a large part of the corruption.
Was revoked in October President dmitry medvedevem, but since then we can monitor only minimal changes in the clean up.
Luzhkov and his wife yelena baturina, which owns a prominent design company, for many years continues to deny charges of corruption, and won a number of actions for perjury charges for such accusations.
In September, said on Russian television station, when he was asked about the proven testimony about the corruption: "It's crazy, if it's dirty, it's crap."
Russians confident with absolute conviction that if their company is corrupt, then they'll show up to vote.
But it is unusual to such details vyřčenými in such a way, and in the ambasádní report, and it is also outrageous that diplomats would do so from foreign countries.
"The Moscow city government and its links with the criminal element, some led to called it 'dysfunctional,' and confirm that the government works more like kleptocracy checked than as a government," the report says.
"criminal elements in the forward from the post office. 'krysha' of the term of the world of jail and mafia, which literally means' roof 'or protection, provided by police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service, the FSB, the Interior Ministry and the Public Prosecutor's office, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city to Moscow.
"Analysts identified and třístupňovou structure in the criminal world to Moscow."
"luzhkov is at the top."
"The Federal Security Service, the Interior Ministry and militias are on the second level."
"and finally at the lowest level are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is ineffective system, in which the criminal group fill out empty space in some areas, because the city does not give some services."
The report says that the FSB takes money from the largest companies and police focus on smaller businesses.
One source said, "business owners in Moscow recognize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior, rather than from the organized criminal groups, because they do not have weapons, resources and forces only more than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law."
"For this reason, no protection from criminal gangs is not so in course."
Record he says that while the selection of money is comprehensive, protecting itself may already be in trouble; and those who can pay can sometimes be arrested.
To those who don't fast enough, with their business under different pretenses closing.
Medvedev several times spoke about the fight against corruption, but admitted that he made only a little progress.
Ambasádní The report talks about men taking cases, probably bulging cash, in the kremlinu.
"in its fight against corruption must be medvedev rely on bureaucrats," he said in a recent interview georgy satarov, director of the Moscow research team indem.
"But it is part of this bureaucracy."
"is not part of the political class, because the political class in the Russia already exist."
Without politicians, without opposition, without the distribution of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that a nationwide increase faces corruption Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country is on the 154. instead in a recent survey on a global Corruption Perception NGO Transparency International, countries are řazeny from at least after the most corrupt.
Disclosure of the US Embassy, which appeared in Moscow in the late evening hours, to arouse enthusiasm for the Russian government, although only to the extent that for Moscow's shortcomings may be accused of luzhkov, it may be for kremlin way to argue in the matter of the solution to the problem.
While in a CNN interview with Larry kingem told Putin that the documents published by WikiLeaks could be fake and reacted angrily to a statement that the American diplomats call him batman and medvedeva Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that it is our mutual assistance, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, nedomnívali we have that it will be carried out in such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so neeticky."
Veterans of the Red khmérů are forced to come to terms with the past
In a dimly lighted concrete classroom walls with zašpiněnými and oloupanými reminded the director of the school anlong veng High School of the man who built it, leader of the Khmer Rouge the drink.
"All of moka love the one here."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," he said sreng kor Ma, 42.
Known as "The Butcher" for his brutality during the rule of the Khmer Rouge, remains popular commander in this remote estate of the Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia, where built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization is still alive.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge gave up the government, she's busted a longstanding loyalty also in anlong vengu.
In April was the victims in the forum of Truth and Reconciliation to publicly confront with the people who had been part of the regime.
In June, the government has provided textbooks, which for the first time children explain the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers.
And in July to a joint UN and Cambodia's court the first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge leaders, a conviction of former leader, notoriously known of a violent tuol Association sleng, kaing khek iev, známějšího like a ghost, to 35 years in prison.
With each such progress, rising unrest among veterans of the Khmer Rouge in anlong veng, which complicates efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to engage in Cambodia's society.
"between the former Khmer khmery is resentment and fear, but they are powerless to do anything," he said chhang youk, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them was the life of the Red khmery beautiful, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, it was an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or reprocessing.
When the Vietnamese attacked and overthrow the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There began the insurgency, which lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon chea and Ieng Sary by guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and jungles in Western Cambodia, while the drink, kultivoval followers in anlong vengu.
But in the 1990s, after a peace agreement, sponsored by the UN, the country was held to the first democratic elections in 1993. A large group of the Khmer Rouge fighters began to move to the Government, which culminated in the surrender Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon chea and Khieu samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 and the drink of natural causes, which continues, was captured in 1999 by government forces in nedalých dangrek mountains.
Died in Phnom penhském prison in 2006 while waiting for the process.
Their patrons for nepečovali, most of them former combatants Khmer Rouge sank in the plain of Cambodia's rural life, and many of them nostalgically recalls for the movement.
Although a number of the elite Khmer Rouge has maintained its position as the local government in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unskilled farmers.
"These people should benefit from just a minimum of surrender," said the rival leang from the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which results in a public forum across Cambodia, including anlong vengu.
"They're surrounded by utopickou agricultural ideologies of the regime."
"were the bedside manner without any ideas on the implementation of the trade."
Sor Lim, 55, who went to the khmerům as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around anlong vengu before he settled in as a poor farmer in 1998.
"life under the Khmer khmery was good," he said.
"All the sustenance of the drink."
"But now is a hard life, because we all need to secure themselves."
The ongoing court Khmer Rouge also has given rise to concerns.
At the beginning of next year will begin Court to investigate Nuon chea, Khieu samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng thirith, another former Minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The Court has a mandate to prosecute the head of přestavitele and people responsible for the crimes, but has not said whether it will continue also in the four cases.
It was little, to have been reassured concerns in anlong vengu.
Recent media speculation concentrated on IM chaema, 64, who was a regional leader in the province of banteay meanchey during the governments of the Khmer Rouge in the late 1970s.
Researchers from the Documentation Center of Cambodia, said in 2007 that supervised the construction of the dam trapeang thma, project, in which thousands of forced workers might have died.
Recent smoking evening the IM chaem returned from work in the field to his wooden cottage on the dirty road outside anlong veng.
As the sun began to descend and explore the shadows across the dry grass, im chaem refused to speak about his past the Red khmery.
If the court summoned her, refused to go.
"in Cambodia of peace and it is stable," she said.
"If they discover another criminal prosecution, will be a war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who ran from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that it comes to instability if the court will look for other suspects, although experts and historians do not agree with that.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and buried in her past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia must do to move forward, he said chhang youk from the Documentation Center.
"reconciliation in khmerským circumstances means slepení broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to give the broken pieces together, to be able to understand."
Center, the first book approved by the Government about the khmerech, has 75 of the parties and the name of the "democratic history of Cambodia."
Was distributed in anlong vengu in June as a supplement to the textbook of the history of the Ministry of Education, which has fewer than four parties of the khmerech.
As well as many people in Cambodia, as well as the young people in anlong vengu knew only few details about the khmerech, despite the city with the regime.
Touch valeak, 19, a student at the high school in anlong veng said that the new book helps students understand the important parts of their history.
But his parents were skeptical, when he took home the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the courts," he said.
"are suspicious, because they aren't sure how many people will be court to prosecute."
Such a resistance is a more complex and difficult process of reconciliation, said leang rival.
But the public forum, textbooks and are beginning to have an impact, told the court.
The Khmer Rouge here are still strong spell.
Up in the mountains dangrek mountains are the overgrown weeds and vysypaná odhozenými plastic bags, which leads to a rectangle from the black soot covered the rusty tin roof.
The body of Pol pota here was burned on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom sothea, 31, retail cell phones on the edge of the road said that he doesn't know a lot about the man, who was cremated in that place.
"but has a strong spirit, many local people come through here and pray for him," she said.
Nuom sothea her name and was in the plan later to visit a resting place Pol pota where will bring the volume of bananas, in the hope that it would bring good luck.
Belarus agrees that seems to its stocks of weapons on the basis of uranium
In DID with its surprise victory in the president's campaign to ensure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian Government announced on Wednesday that it will give up its stocks of highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement, issued after a security summit Secretary Hillary rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister by Sergei Martynov.
The US government has tried for years to persuade Belarus to relinquishing the highly enriched uranium, and it seemed that discovered last spring on the sticking points.
But US officials have said the Washington Post, that were carried out with Belarus in the past two months a few classified operations to eliminate 187 pounds of weapons on the basis of uranium from the Belarusian Research Facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday an agreement to remove the rest of the material - approximately 500 pounds, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement turned out to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th national summit on nuclear security in April, on which the Belarus was discarded.
And was likely to ensure a good move the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the subsequent summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated with the fact that they want a place at the summit on nuclear bezpečnosti2012."
"This proves that the process works," said Ken luongo, president of the Partnership for global security, groups supporting the nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement as "very important, an important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, that will ensure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of all of its stocks of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so for the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama summit on nuclear security, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that his nation will never surrender its uranium.
"We have a highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is in fact a basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," he said after Lukashenko.
"It is our commodity... we are not going to produce dirty bombs and it also we are not going to sell anyone."
"We use it only for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus, however, a few months ago acceded to the United States and have expressed an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to eliminate the Belarus uranium in October, was particularly complicated because the material was slightly ozářen, officials announced.
Was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1, 300 miles in the Russian equipment for the storage and disposal, officials said.
The second operation was concluded on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The US government for the programme spent 13 million dollars, most of it for the supply of the Belarusian Research Institute of less enriched uranium that is no good for the production of nuclear weapons.

But Wednesday statement suggests the possibility of the gradual thaw.

The Spanish government didn't do with the CIA flights secrets
The Spanish Government was not making secrets about CIA flights carrying trapped talibance and members of al-qaida to Guantanamo through the Spanish territory, as he put in his telegram of the Ambassador of the United States in Madrid.
That follows the documents provided by WikiLeaks newspaper, El País, where he also says that the First Deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa fernándezová de la vegová requested that the Spanish executive was informed and could "so as to show that it has proper supervision of Foreign Aircraft prolétajícími Spanish airspace."
In June 2006, after the communication from the Council of Europe, in which it blamed on a dozen states, including Spain of complicity in the violation of human rights, a meeting was held between the US ambassador eduardem Aguirre would never and fernándezovou de la vegovou.
The Deputy Prime Minister said that the statement of the Council of Europe "exempt zapaterovu government from the game" and insisted that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
De la vegová stressed that Spain does not have a problem with years ago of the secret services through its territory.
"simply want to be only informed" that they are not "caught off guard," tells Aguirre would never in one of the documents.
Also the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miguel ángel moratinos indicated the American ambassador that the Spanish government "would like to give this matter what may be the lowest outlines, but the fact that this matter was in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited impact options."
In February 2007, prosecutor Vicente gonzález said the embassy, that if his concerns, does not intend to block the initiative of the judge to request the declassification of the document of the National Center of the secret services, cni and the Defense Ministry relating to the CIA flights.
"This information does not contain no passage in question it or any sensitive information," said the embassy after the interview with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US expressed concerns because of coordination between the judge and the German prosecutors "obvious" rather than because of declassifying information cni or the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between the independent experts will be complicated our efforts to solve this case discreetly between governments," regrets Aguirre would never.
In March 2007, on the occasion of lunch the US Ambassador and the Minister of the Interior Alfred péreze rubalcaby, the ambassador said that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous on its independence and to do what they considered appropriate," commissioned already instructed his colleagues, "to avoid rozohněným comments with a view to reduce tension."

"Despite its general proamerickou orientation our experience tells us that the Partido Popular Party will not hesitate to take any indication that zapaterova government tolerated or deliberately ignored the US negotiations, which could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, and that even in the event that these revelations could have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," he notes.

Receive would get four seats in the House and the PSC, Socialist Party of Catalonia - yes. It lost 9 seats
With the results of the November 28, the Party of the PP could have the decisive word in the radnicích in léridě, tarragoně and Barcelona.
After a significant increase of votes and the number of senior members during the recent autonomous election, katalánská PP, People's Party of Catalonia - Yes. already has the idea of the general election, whether there will be an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes in the national election is usually one of its kind against the Catalan election.
Gained in 2008 katalánští receive in a general election 610.473 votes, while in the autonomous elections of the year 2006, this figure was only 316.222.
Last Sunday received ppc the People's Party of Catalonia. 384.091 voice.
Udrží-li increases with this trend, which was supported by the transfer of the votes from the PP's PSC and the loyalty of voters, analysts of this party have calculated that if the general elections to take place, ppc could win 12 Members in the House from the current 8, party ciu - convergencia and unió, Czech agreement and the Union - yes. Also would have four mandates, now has 10 of them and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats, now has 25.
The calculations would confirm that Catalonia is for the PP and the PSOE by Spanish Socialist Worker's Party of fundamental importance.
According to this analysis lidovců would be a party ERC, left the Republican Party of Catalonia - Yes. lost the member's one - now has 3 - while icv - green initiative for Catalonia - Yes. should remain one of mandate, or would have one more.
However, according to the electoral calendar will take place in the nearest appointment may 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, which would also be able to receive a decisive impact on the end of the domination of the Socialist Group in four major provincial cities and also on changes in the Barcelona Council by diputación de Barcelona, which is one of the administrations with the expected budget - 661 million euros for the year of 2011.
Both the nationalists and receive the same with the possibility that the PSC could lose the City Hall in Barcelona, tarragoně, léridě and geroně, where the Socialists would received a majority, and would not turn to their traditional ally, the ERC and icv.
In view of the debacle of Republicans would have been impossible, if this party has lost its representation in the Barcelona - Site as it is appropriate to obtain at least 5% of the votes.
PP Party increased the number of votes in four major cities and could have a decisive impact in Barcelona, léridě and tarragoně.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the turnover in tarragoně, where ruled together with the party the PP before the current mayor, josepem félixem ballesterosem.
In léridě pp has received only about 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with marianem rajoyem - have met on several occasions during the last campaign.
Receive also gained on other major radnicích such as badalona, castelldeels or reus.
At present, the PP representation to 34 radnicích in Catalonia, and I would create a nominee in what may be the most municipalities.

This broken cell was not the only active, which had a network of jihad in Europe, and therefore take part in these investigations in addition to Thai services also other European police unit, and cannot be ruled out that in the coming days, there will be similar intervention in other European countries, like the one in Barcelona last Tuesday at night.
In connection with this operation, when they were detained for the junaid humayun, atiqur rehman, jabran asghar, Malik iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad saddique Khan begum, tanveer arshad and nigerijec babatunde agunbiade. To develop further in Thailand, in which they were captured for Muhammad athar butt and zeeshan Ehsan butt and thajec sirikanlaya kijbumrung.
They were just these men, who was driving from Bangkok cell based in Spain and the other in other European countries.
Katalánská network, part of which was destroyed in the year 2009, steal tourists in particular passports, which meet the requirements of the Islamists.
This means that the documents had to be to men aged between 25 and 45 years old, had to have a force of several years and be highlighted without visas.
In the investigative documents is stressed that so far no facts are not known to connect the detainees out of Catalonia with the assassination in Mumbai, although the author of these attacks," lashkar-e-taiba," was supposed to be one of the groups that have received passports stolen in Spain and then falsifikované in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before that were sent to the assassination of of Catalonia conversion agency about thousand dollars, which have been "embedded" the purchase of cards to mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "commando," which killed 106 people.
Police have already lose many of the evidence.

Director geriatrického device assures that the deaths occurred as a result of "lack of action"
The center olot exclusive, that their minder killed more than 11 clients
Leadership geriatrického center of La caritat de olot, gerona gave a press conference yesterday, to vylíčilo, what kind of damage caused the institution of the criminal behavior joana villa dilmé, workers, that, while there was employed, killed at least eleven offers, which was in custody.
The Director of this home for the elderly Joan Sala was accompanied by a lawyer equipment, a lawyer joana Canada, and reported that "the wishes of the home of La caritat would be able to press charges up to the guilty" responsible for killing, but "the rule of law and the responsibility to oblige us to leave this process to the competent authorities."
In addition to the damage to the good name of this institution, which may be due to the fact that in time revealed the criminal activities of the workers, a great threat to the home of La caritat are now requirements in the material compensation, which already calculated by legal representatives of the families of survivors.
Joan villa dilmé admitted that his first crime was already in August 2009 and that from now on, stopped killing
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of clients of home for the elderly with suspicion that, in many cases, neprohlížel dead no doctor personally, but that, in view of the age and poor health condition of patients - all vyřizovalo over the phone.
La caritat yesterday through its director firmly rejected this extreme and stressed that "the lack of measures could not be in any case, the cause of which took place."
The legal representative of La caritat added that "in case there are no indications that there would be any third party in addition to his own of the defendant committed misconduct."
Man nicknamed now "Angel of Death" admitted yesterday 11 killing and said that the first crime has committed 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later killed the other nanny.
In this case, have caused the deaths of the submission of too high doses of insulin, in contrast to the first case, when he used a mixture of comforting bars.
Director of La caritat said that it is complicated to control access to this personnel to medikamentům.
Insulin and shake the sedatives were probably in six cases of nine means to use this minder to patients killed in its attempt to relieve them from suffering.
But only the analysis, which are taking place in the laboratory, would show whether Villa lies and they really wanted for its first victims less brutal death or on the contrary, it is killed the submission of sodium, as has already admitted in the case of three women killed by between 12 and 17 October.
In La caritat doesn't believe zdravotníkovým claim and not exclusive, that the number of deaths may be higher than what was said, and justify their behaviour in the various versions, which handed the villa of the trial with the knowledge that they must change their negotiations, when it became clear that killed eight people.
Because they say that they want to be available to the judiciary was lit the entire range of this matter.
The European Central Bank is
Investors responded sharply to yesterday's threat of the President of the European Central Bank yesterday Trichet, who said that "markets should not be underestimated our ability to respond."
Marginal diferenciály closed the force and shares of European banks have fallen by more than 5%.
However, also we should not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to err - the euro is about to go above the critical value.
This has happened yesterday, is typical of the illiquid market, which, though there is a decline, is recovering - but with a short and very speculative positions.
Investor will take some time to lose the concerns.
A month ago, the European Central Bank cited us today to take back the level of liquidity, and tomorrow will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
Bundesbank called for putting an end to the plan to buy back public debt for inefficiency and eliminate all emergency liquidity rates within and keep unrestricted access only for a period of one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect that the liquidity rate forecast "at least" and will keep the three months to March licitaci with unlimited access by the end of this session, in order to guarantee the liquidity of at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue its programme of the purchase of bonds and that even to notify his intensification.
Nenaplní-li created expectations, creates the market reaction from yesterday, again, and if they continue to blindly continue in the withdrawal of liquidity rates, God with us!
It was the same at the Congress in May, where argued that even thought of buying bonds, and there was a collapse in the markets - tomorrow could repeat history.
The European Central Bank must be credible and relentless.
In May, it announced locked fist on Monday and Wednesday said that has already purchased many of them, which caused another collapse of the market.
Bidding bills for one year in Portugal yesterday was very poor.
El tesoro, only 500 million with 5.28% in comparison with 750 million with 4.81% from the previous auction.
Lowering interest rates fell 30 points in Portugal below, odrážejíce and change the mood in the market, which took place after word Trichet.
In Ireland, was published figures represent the loss of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amount to around 10,000 million on short securities and other potential 15,000, have a chance to be a private capital in February, or it will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after a problem in July did not reveal stresovými tests, the amounts are in the framework of the auxiliary plan acceptable and will help reduce the odds.
However, next Tuesday will need the government to seek the approval of the new budget in parliament and still does not have sufficient support, so in Ireland remain a uncertainty.
Angela Merkel eased the tone of his speech to release the tensions in the face for the next meeting, the EU held on December 14, in which it is necessary to be a political compromise that would show that we are the Union and we're all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while the others would rather Beethoven: Ode to Joy.
In Spain, he had Prime Minister yesterday to present the plan of action, which will be approved in the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous areas and the financial institutions, reducing the deficit, liberalization, privatization, measures to boost employment - It sounds like the Four Seasons in the ears of investors from Vivaldi.
Double Effect Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish Stock Exchange increased by 4.5%, i.e. double than the rest of the European stock exchanges.
In contrast to the February was the government's response and the Spanish National Bank of quick and strong - beneficiaries probably from the effect of surprise.
Today we have a key licitaci bond for three years, which Will Be Advantage effect Trichet, making, we hope after it will be a big demand, which will help to doubts about our ability of refinancing.
Ask a rescue plan would be to sacrifice for Spain.
They will give us cash, which we do not need - in El Tesoro is available to 40,000 million in cash, three times more than in March - as well as the high rates and access to the US markets closed sine die.
However, it is necessary to continue to use the strategy of cesarovy women - not just be the," but also the zdáti."
We can do this.

Its objective is to faithfully reproduce product or simulated process before it is actually created, so as to avoid unnecessary errors and expenditure.
Plm facilitate the development of Canon camera, aircraft sukhoi of noted or commercial vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried russwurm, head of industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this software apparatus made it possible for Team Red Bull take place "in the next few hours, almost in real time" modification and improvement, which otherwise detect during the plants and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992, the average 10 technicians stable, who were able to make a maximum of three or four improvement during the same period.
In the Red Bull team is working now to 180 young highly qualified professionals with an information technology, who analyse and propose every type of racing modification of vehicles.

The hero of the Red bullu is in Formula 1 without a doubt the fresh champion Sebastian vettel.
For nezměrnými technological means that put the mark of energy drinks heading into its participation in the race, however, have other protagonists, whose aid is invaluable, and there is no one knows.
Head of production technology Steve nevey says that, five years ago, it is possible to say that progress in the research and development of vehicles contribute to the victory of 50%, and the rest was by riders.
At present, the ratio has changed and the technology behind the achievements of 85%, while the pilots contribute from 15%.
Nevey recognises that vettel or webber will never be replaced by computer technology, as it "unpredictable gladiátoři."

Sabadell is betting on the fact that "steal" during the three years of its competitors million clients
More positive than other bosses, delegovaný member of the Council of the bank Banco Sabadell, Jaime guardiola, believes that the year 2011 will be difficult for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of passive war.
Yet provides for a reduction of interest rates, which, however, will try to compensate slevněním bank charges and the price of credit.
Sabadell, it is expected that he will receive a million private clients over three years.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years and power so as to survive in the tough economic conditions.
Bank starts a new strategic plan with effect in 2011 for three years.
The aim is, in addition to the survival without having to turn to public assistance in frob, gain market share podchycením million new private clients - or the 700.000, odečtou-li with those who may leave the bank - because until now ai Institute coddled small and medium enterprises and big companies rather than small clients.
This year has already received the Bank 250,000 private clients and 50,000 enterprises.
Its share of the market is, in terms of private clients of 3.5%, while the corporate customer is more than 10%.
Another of the fundamental ideas plan 2011-2013 is the commitment to productivity, or you can also say sobriety, with a view to reduce costs, which calls to show the bank will have to present the results for the period.
Few of banking institutions are daring to set the goal and publish them in this time, since the financial crisis has changed all the plans of the global banking.
Sabadell shut its program this year declined, as laid down four years ago, although he had been for three years, but the situation on the markets requested the extension for a further period.
Clients who go from savings, will be the main target group.
At a meeting convened by apie insisted guardiola on the fact that the year 2011 will be "hard and very important."
Indeed, it considers that the way out of the crisis in Spain "will be long."
In addition, it will be very difficult for two or three years "to create employment," which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And though believes that the passive war - which reduces - receding margins, price margins for the risk that banks and savings banks is paying for their emissions, to obtain liquidity is already on the prices of the loans, which compensates reduce margins.
"the subject of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We have entered the trigger, but diferenciály are very high," he guardiola.
Banesto orders already gave its network on Thursday to have been reduced long term loans and increased prices diferenciálů - see cincodías of 22 and 27 November.
Also recognised that trends in the Banking "now is the reduction of commissions," but there is "competitive framework."

And points out that frob May on the market suplovat the collection of funds from the new measure capital.
After the assurances that Sabadell can survive a temporary closure of the markets, it is still a serious problem, what some bankers predict as new liquidity crisis.

Ceca excludes the next wave of mergers savings
Director General ceca refused yesterday, that should emerge from another wave of mergers savings, and again insisted on the speed with which it is carrying out the reorganisation of the sector.
When started the process of association of Spanish savings banks, was several institutions, which ujišťovaly, that the first phase will be present and wait for the second round.
However, General Director of the Spanish Confederation society, ceca, José Antonio olavarrieta yesterday ruled out that should emerge from a new wave of these operations.
"I believe that most of the merger has already been carried out, inkorporaci cajasolu to group Banca cívica cannot be considered the second round, that what is happening is the convention."
"Most of it is completely carried out; it is possible that instead of 17 institutions, we'll go to the 13 or 14, but all of the processes are already finished, and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which cooperated very well in this matter," the director said.
In its statement on the meeting adea, Association of management and executive officials aragonu - Yes. olavarrieta related that process concentration is "the highest possible speed and we have to be very happy, as recorded in instalments, that her time, not now, appeared in the trade plans with a Spanish national bank," he stressed.
"To go from 45 savings with the average volume of assets built million to 17, the 75.500 million is a process that is unprecedented in the history of the comparison, redukujíce so the number of institutions of 62% that these were more and that way in accordance with the Basel Treaty," underline.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of less fortunate views on the slowness of the process" to show "a lack of serious and understanding" because "that's what he's doing, Spanish National Bank is a reminder that we need to be before the end of the year in the term."
Director General ceca José Antonio olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain has the most stringent financial system in the whole of Europe and "probably" even in the world, and those who challenge it, seemed to be "the lack of knowledge."
Director noted that in the current favourable economic situation "We can be calm" on the financial institutions and savings and system, which handled "very important" the process of concentration and that is continuing, "the highest possible speed."
Also mentioned that the Spanish banking became very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and German Red line
Berlin decided to maintain the euro, but set conditions for the Union.
Tension in the markets a double government response.
On the one hand, to propose José Luis Zapatero to new adaptation measures from the reduction of taxes for small and medium sized enterprises, over the regulation of private agencies or lifting 426 euros for the unemployed without benefits to the privatisation of 49% aena - Spanish airports and air traffic management - Yes., manager of airport barajas and El prat and 30% of the state lottery.
Of Elena salgadová with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe gonzáleze, on the other hand, join the reviews on the Chancellor Angela Merkel because of its responsibility for initiating the current crisis.
How to interpret this emotion?
It has to be said in advance that Merkel opinion is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in a complex process redefinice euro.
And here, Germany has had a radically new vision of what is supposed to be its future, which faces on the idea of compliance with old traditions, which holds a large part of the other members.
In the face of European resistance in Germany is to speculate about the three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first of them is the strong euro area, part of which would be just Germany, but also, for example, Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would have left monetary zone.
The other is a return to the mark - though it may seem as scifi now, this version has broad public support, close to 50% of the population.
The third option is recasting of the euro, according to German proposals with more macroeconomic supervision, budget severity, fines for the guilty States, possible delays of payments for some of them, and to extend possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and already defines for a while, so there is no room for now subterfuge.
First in 2009, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission to promote the deficits, pulled out of a German Government constitutional reform that prevented them from the year 2016.
This was the first sign of a conflict between what it considered a Germany the right of fiscal stringency plans and the stability of public finances, and What were his European partners, including France.
The other showed the Central European country, when Merkel sorely protahovala decision on the rescue of Greece.
Already was the subject of sharp criticism at the time, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, have been strongly opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel appeared again with a clear opinion, when asked to reform the convention of the European Union in order to permit the salvation of a Member State and at the same time, to have private creditors to bear part of the cost.
This opinion has been interpreted as the opposite of Europe, as has accelerated the crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, though in a slightly zmírněné form, was approved, and during the next few months, we should follow the reform process of the Union, which should allow these measures from 2013.
Germany took a red line that cannot exceed.
And all tells us that, even though it now needs to take measures that are probably too disagree, since that date, the old functioning of the euro will end.
Year 2013 will be the birth of a new currency zone, in which states violating the rules will be penalised hard and may be forced to announce the postponement of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the cost.
Germany suggests us that we have to give strict way of growth to increase savings rates and investment, moderate consumption, improve the productivity and competitiveness, and the capital reserves.
No choice based on claims, and building, with huge spaces in the balance of payments, what was in the boom years of growth of Spain, simply not tolerate.
Offer is clear.
And we would be making a mistake if we understood this.
It is not just about the renewal of the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want us to do, it is much harder.
And the worst is that, under these conditions, we might be done, that they zmýlíme.
I hope that these more calm will replace the current turbulence.
And that we will take the opportunity that we give to the spring 2013.
It seems that the Prime Minister Zapatero also realized it and his double the declaration of reforms promised after meeting with large enterprises from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures, it suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel open the way the idea that let this be the right thing to do.
But the Red line, which Germany itself, is here, and does not appear to be with her to move.
AND OF THE options, over which can be considered, cannot be leaving the euro area full less serious countries ruled out.
Now, Germany, we will always be able to say that we warned.
Sport and circumvent the rules
Tricks that gave Alonso and Ramos in the match with ajaxem, show wit rather than a intention to escape punishment.
Supposedly zosnovaná the exclusion of two players of Real Madrid, xabiho alonsa and collections Ramos of the Champions League in the match against ajaxu of 23 November meant that it was dumped into the sea ink on whether this is or is not unsportsmanlike behavior, and whether it would at UEFA should not punish both football player.
As is well known, a few minutes before the end of the game, who had their team clearly vyhraný, appointed players ONE BY ONE deliberately losing time at a time when he was playing a foul in order to provoke sudího, and he showed them a second yellow card.
In this way, both players will prescribed punishment in the following match against auxerre - with Real Madrid ends up in his group at the forefront of the - and deprived of The card will be able to continue in the next stage.
At the end of the day, the disciplinary commission of UEFA trenéru José mourinhovi punishment for two games and errant players receive a cash fine.
Provoking the yellow cards in similar circumstances, there is no new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that is part of the ethos of football, the rules that are an unwritten, but watching the.
Part of the discussion in this case arose because of the fact that the participant was a team of Real Madrid, which is in its hymně boast šlechetností and honour, and which has already for similar acts of his players, pokutoval, and, it seems, as well as by drama led by mourinhem, who had just added to its long history of model and provokatéra another episode.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this kind of action, which is not the rules explicitly prohibited, is in violation of the principles of sport, that is, whether in these deeds, to circumvent the law; it is indeed a action respecting sporting rules, which has, however, seems to want to bypass the sense.
It is what type of damage such negotiations there is a sporting spirit.
One of the requirements of sportsmanship is the physical integrity of opponents, which was not violated in these cases, so there has been no violent game.
Another one of these requirements charakterizujících clean game is to prevent the players because of their offence had the advantage against a team - to which also occurred here.
Therefore paradoxical to action players Real Madrid is the fact that it had not been to what normally charakterizujeme as a trick or circumvent the law, there has been a secret infringement of rules in order to avoid a penalty, but this behavior should be as clear as possible in order to receive the punishment.
Wait and like punishment they got.
Another question, however, is what will have the benefit of the guilty of its deliberate violation.
Here it is necessary to say that the opponent is in a disadvantaged position, and that in the current game can't get no benefit, as an obvious consequence is that the team will have fewer players.
And even that is not useful strategy in the next game, as the club cannot be calculated with these players.
Advantage clearly lies in the fact that the players will start the next stage of the Champions League without cards, which could affect their participation in the game of the future.
But this is an advantage in the long term, and with a certain degree of uncertainty, at first glance team can be eliminated, and out of this process will have players of punishment, and go into the second round of cards, in which the exclusion is enough for one card less than in the first round.
So how will continue the round, will not be fully clear, whether it is the advantage.
And, in short, these negotiations do not go against the spirit of sport, part of which is to make the strategic decision to get the maximum benefit in the framework of the rules.
In the event that we are dealing here with, did not have the players aim to avoid the penalty, which would have been a clear case of the rules, but rather they have chosen a, when to obey him.
Make a strategic decision, without avoiding punishment or were running away from him.
Although there are no borders between wit and circumvention of rules very clear, I believe that, in this case, it was clearly on the wit.
It seems to me that controversy arises for two reasons: because this was a two samovyloučení and because of the way it has transfer instructions to their provocation from the leadership.
Damage to the sports principles of these actions is not so ethical as aesthetic.
Fight offers on the holding of Christmas parties in Barcelona
The Spell of calendar concentrated reservations avalanche on 16 and 17 December this year.
Fast celebration is mounting financed by themselves employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.

Also saw that it is already there are companies that again invite their employees, and it seems that the size of groups is a bit more.
Vice President of the company fecasarm, which includes institutions such as the Association of bars, restaurants and centres of free time in Barcelona, enric Goma believes that is starting to see the end of the tunnel, and claimed that the number of reservations," revived," although "smlouvají clients to maximum."
This impression swerve even during the Christmas celebrations to pay who pay points.
Pakistan's nuclear program resulted in great unrest in the US
, Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "at a higher rate than any other country."
WikiLeaks documents confirm the links between talibánci and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the Embassy of the United States in Pakistan and the US Foreign Ministry published the portal WikiLeaks confirms the unrest that in Washington raises Pakistan's nuclear program.
In addition to the objasňujících and important details, which offer about the content of communications and ideas of representatives of the North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that the cooperation between the two states in terms of nuclear safety, rather than to be increased," is in retreat," and that this unstable Asian country produced "more than any other state" of nuclear weapons.
Trait of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but store after the works, to be znesnadněna Their Destruction in case of an attack - is one of the main reasons of vigilance Washington.
This calculated Ambassador in Pakistan Anne W. pattersonová in one report in advance of the visit of the then National Security Adviser to James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under the control of the Taliban, the alleged diversion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials."
An increased number of persons associated with nuclear arsenály and with the missile programme is not already observed the US only, but also Russia, as a pervasive and a reason to be alert.
"Pakistan had to hire staff with strict religious faith to the protection of nuclear facilities; due to the decline of the level of education and culture have extremist organisation of more opportunities to recruit people who will work in the nuclear programs and missile programmes," he said the expert Yuri korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry on the meeting with his counterparts from the United States.
The biggest new dossier published by Julian assangeho is increasingly the lower cooperation between the US and Pakistan in the topic of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and increased rate of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
Message issued by the embassy in May, which qualifies the communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," says: "There is no transparency often; offers of assistance remain without a response or are rejected."
In another report notes Peter lavoy, a member of national intelligence services for South Asia, that "despite the economic disaster of Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as fast as no other nation in the world."
Ambassador pettersonová also asks Washington to during the visit of Chief of Staff General ashfaqa kayaniho," very well made clear "that" the Pakistani army must do away with a quiet support of terrorist groups."
Hunt for WikiLeaks Chief
Obama called the senior staff responsible for the fight against terrorism, to avoid new evasion of information.
Interpol issues "red Challenge" with a view to track down and determine where they would assange could be.
Everything relating to WikiLeaks and its founder Julian assangeho are complicated labyrinth, where it is difficult to be sure the facts.
Interpol announced yesterday "The emergency call," the red notice, to "lokalizování and monitoring the movement of" assangeho.
But it is not a classic command to detention.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but dating back to the 20th November.
And has nothing to do with the latest of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with allegations of sexual abuse, which australan faces in Sweden.
In addition, assures the legal representative of the WikiLeaks mark stephens, that "the police know where and how to contact with the assangem."
This was the 20th of November, when the international force police, based in the French Lyon issued the order at the request of Sweden, nezveřejnil but it until yesterday when he received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation has 188 countries Interpol guidelines to identify or location of the assangeho "in order to impose temporary custody of him and give it."
Although Interpol cannot to order the detention of persons, which concerns the red challenge, many of the Member States, as the organization explained, however, consider the 'Red Notice' to arrest the do - it must be ensured the national police component - especially in the case when countries are mutual agreement on the issue of the detainees, as is the case in Sweden and England, where they apparently had assange finding.
This step its sales fell assengeho lawyers who yesterday the writing, where they are saying that devětatřicetiletý founder WikiLeaks shown a willingness to answer questions of the Swedish authorities using video conferences.
Also remind that assenge asked and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from prokurátorky of his case that comparisons with the legendary lavrentijem pavlovičem berijou, head of Stalin's safety.
"This is a hunt and not legal pursuit," the letter.
While the whole world is looking for it - and his mother from Australia defence of the innocence of his son - assange is away to an unknown place, but nemlčí.
On Monday provided through the Skype from an unknown place in an interview šéfredaktorovi Time magazine - Hillary Clinton called for the resignation of Secretary of State of the United States in this conversation.
"proves that it was responsible for an order of US diplomats to carry out spying in the United Nations and broke and international conventions, signed by the United States, should step down," he said.
His opinion was yesterday rejected the White House spokesman Robert gibbsem to qualify for the request to as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I am not sure why you should care about the view of the individuals, which operates a Web page," he said on CNN.
Obama himself authorised the senior staff responsible for the fight against terrorism, rusella traverse to prevent another evasion of documents.
Intention President Barack Obama's speaker to add assangemu on the importance of the contrasts with the views, which claim conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
Peter King, a member of Congress, which will be chaired by the national security committee in the lower house since January, asked the foreign ministry to examine the possibility of including WikiLeaks between terrorist organisations," in order to intervene and prosecute anyone who would contribute them financially or otherwise provide assistance."
Further it went flanagan, Advisor to the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen harpera, who declared that assange should "be killed," which in turn had to appeal.
"Obama would be on him was launching a reward or use unmanned aircraft or something like that."
Who are you didn't, Mike was huckabee, Baptist minister, former guvernátor Arkansas and the possible candidate for president.
"Anyone will be in the government, the one who is responsible for the leakage of information has committed treason and any other punishment than execution would be too lenient," he said at the station Fox
Puigcercós looking for peace in ERC "Twinkle" on caroda followers
Republican leader will allow the secret vote on its continuation.
Huguet proposes more plurální executive and the end of the schůzovního system.
Joan puigcercós apparently found the way to fight the already advised many of the internal upheavals in the ERC, left the Republican Party of Catalonia - Yes., bezvýslednou because of the loss of 11 members and half of the votes.
Leader of the party is aware that his gesture in relation to seems to be his supporters of former leader Josep lluíse caroda-roviry insufficient, and also knows that the effect of the sector is now already weakened as its leader himself, and that he absolutely can do such worrying about what he had with other zaniklými currents.
Therefore, a leader of the Left will try to gain a new criticism by pomrkávání, which will help him hedge in the municipal elections.
First puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the National Committee will be able to speak out secretly to his continuation in office.
With the ballots, rather than by a show of hands.
If they want to supporters caroda to the chairman of a voice, will be able to do so without fear of retaliatory measures.
In fact, wants to avoid the division and surrender their persons.
In several interviews, argued that it did not consider it confirmed with half of the votes and one, but he added without percent, said that he would also be a good outcome "for Bulgaria."
Supporters of caroda demand after the chairman of more than to give its function available - which are seen as a gesture which has no weight, as puigcercós controls on sjezdech the Authority.
But due to the fact that they have a sufficient majority, so that they can enforce to, will try to executive to plan from now on until May.
Because of this to get a strategic reorientation will participate in drawing up the document, on which the National Council will give the vote on the 18th day of the month.
Their aim is to promote puigcercóse in exchange for the fact that this promises the Congress already in the autumn of 2011.
Leader ERC said that "mnohohlasnost" Damages the stability, and that its aim is to once and for all the organization was able to fight their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this context appears to be symptomatic of the article, which the current advisor, Josep huguet signed on his blog.
After he took into account puigcercósův ideolog, this advisor for innovation has taken a fait accompli that leader will be confirmed "in exchange for a few goals."
And the name of the five, two of whom are prominent.
The first is the "překomponování" executive, so that was at least 90% of the members, which means also include new faces, who are from the friendly carodovi.
The second objective may be big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC Completely End schůzovnictvím as a mechanism of operation.
And so is fighting for the reform of the statutes to be held congresses through delegates of the vote.
Doing away with the model schůzovního system, the exception in the Spanish system of political parties, is intended to puigcercósova team who fought in this regard already in the last two sjezdech.
However, a meeting of the year 2008 decided that schůzovnictví must be examined at a special congress on reforms of the articles of association.
This matter is still nevyřízená, as the situation inside the party with the solution of this issue.
Now, without lurking critical sectors, could be an appropriate time to address this issue once again and try to make it close once and for all.

450 nasmlouvaných million, with no public competitions
Hydro-québec agreed by mutual agreement 450 million in contracts with companies of providing engineering to hydroelektrický eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert project.
More than 100 contracts at the heart of this, it is the consortium created from companies bpr, dessau, Groupe standard and axor, which received the most important contract, the contract for the management of the project at a total cost of 295 million dollars without public competition.
This consortium, on behalf of the energy gérance was in 2004 zplnomocněno in parallel with the choice of the company hydro-québec to were committing to the private sector its responsibility for the management of this important hydroelektrického project at the value of $5 billion.
At the beginning of the year 2005, a consortium of "energy gérance" received a lucrative contract without any announcement of a public competition.
For quebeckou side of a complaint to the consortium of companies before presents us with a serious problem the ethical nature, which risks prevent competition and cause price increases.
"It's a new way to implement koluzi and destroy the competition."
"This means that people no longer side agreement they secretly, today, I do it openly," said Rep. PQ yesterday sylvain simard at a news conference.
A little earlier in the morning, M. simard put this issue of the national assembly, because he says that upset, how it can be sold to the public interest as follows.
Minister for Natural Resources, nathalie normandeau, afternoon argued vigorously popírajíc that this would be the case in this contract on koluzi.
"I have my own way," she bellowed, she claimed that the PQ was "dishonest" and "lack of accuracy."
Said, that "it would be the least" that the PQ apologised.
A recipe for creating a consortium is common practice in the world.
It is usually a Alliance, capped at a time which will allow two or more undertakings of the group of their mutual expertisy, so that they can answer the call for tenders for a comprehensive project.
Eastmain project is a very complex with a view to obsáhlost work.
Construction is already running and must be scheduled by 2012.
However, the contract was granted without the competition could act; it was a deal.
We also have to admit that formulka consortia is no longer the exception in Quebec, and even for relatively simple projects.
As Le devoir, revealed last week formulka consortia in the field of advice in engineeringu is the subject of an investigation in the government.
Přelétneme-li in the speed of the commercial register quebeckých firms, this will allow us to find more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be established permanent.
This company dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; think cima +, génivar, snc-lavalin and roche and tecsult.
Any combination, and there were dozens of them, leading to one and the same legal person, and that is dessau.
When it comes to a consortium of energy gérance, Minister of normandeauová underlined in particular the fact that "the territory of La baie James is typical special dynamism labor force, and that hydro-québec respond to it since the 1970's."
The main patron of the project eastmain, réal laporte, from energy companies baie James, sebj, handed the explanation, which make us svraštit his forehead to the fact that the Treaty was concluded by mutual agreement on the management of the project.
"If you're going to public competition and if there are few participants competition lodging an offer, your offered the prices may be higher."
"You have a choice of two possibilities: i.e. that you people, who plays a role in the contract as participants in the competition, and you say that:" Let's make a deal satisfactory and with a good price. "
"But the main idea is that the important is not the price, but the competence of the people," said Mr. laporte.
This Treaty granted a consortium gérance energy is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000, who received the Party of Quebec.
Contracts have been concluded with companies hydro-québec or sebj on the project eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert.
After the verification of the Le devoir count 109 contracts on the advice of engineeringu, concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with firms or their branches, especially with the Laboratories carrying out analysis of samples of soil.
Snc-lavalin collected 22 contracts, of which génivar won 16 of them, tecsult 14 and dessau 10 without should share in the "energy gérance."
All contracts have been concluded.
Together amount to 449 783 $344, including contract with energy companies gérance to 295 131 $564.
Sylvain simard indicated that four companies that are part of the consortium of bpr, dessau, Groupe string and axor, are "very good friends" of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Minister normandeauová released a report that the PQ is also connected with companies that her "to finance," before the stated that this is more of its management staff.
The barometer Responsible Consumption - "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
A Quebec consumer trusts very few actors of sustainable development, but also "impartial" marks and environmental certificate, for it to drive in the range of products.
The worst is that even if the koupeme in media space, which urges and calls on us to the socially responsible consumption, lamenting the media space over the lack of credible information, failure to fulfil obligations, which even qualify as a brake for its commitment, says baromètre responsible consumption, whose first article was published yesterday.
Even if, in the year 2010, increased consumption for example of socially responsible products, the people of Quebec, who try to sell them, don't trust them, too
In fact, two thirds of US firms say they don't trust the promises, relating to the environment, simply because the green advertising companies, determined measurement instrument, which was drawn up by the observatory responsible consumption University in sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumers has doubts about the credibility of official certificate, přikládaných on fair for example products, but also about the credibility of products and brands that are referred to as environmentally responsible, says barometre.
In the same way and the debate of politicians on this subject is accepted as a serious just 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
Information about the responsible consumption, however, seems to be the main focus of this page to stimulate consumption of activity in the current time, nearly a third of quebeckých consumers.
Indeed, vacuum and questionable nature of the information would alleviate the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
That is the second brake, which identified baromètre, after the higher price of these products.
After all, a third of the population quebekuse incredulously runs against the reported data on the products or services that we're looking for "green" to let them go through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change its behaviour and change the mark of one or more products in particular, which would respond to their convictions.
As much as 61% of them upřednostňovalo purchases for traders in their neighborhood and give priority to the purchase of food, grown in their region, says baromètre.
More "green" a responsible - Index responsible consumption reached 64 of the maximum 100 for the year -, homo consumus québeku to presented as the King of recycling, who works for the lowest possible impact on the environment by that it is concerned about the protection of animals.
But their social and ecological conscience obviously remained somewhere outside their car, says baromètre: in the year 2010, barely 28% of the population of Quebec said that use public transport or that recommended the use of the car to driving at least two people, in order to protect nature.
Walking round and also supported the 39,1% of the participants of a comprehensive survey of conduct, who used this rhetoric.
State loan to buy back the cinemas excentris
The Government of Quebec, which we have already applied for financial participation to buy back the complex cinemas excentris by Angus et le parallèle, agrees with deductibles, but only to the amount of loans.
Developperská company "Angus et le parallèle" to seek a gift of seven million dollars from the Minister of Culture to buy back's cinematographic complex on the boulevard saint-laurenta and that has demonstrated his mission as a lover of art film, failed to obtain what has requested.
The government accepts the fact that will be included in the dossier, but on their own terms.
Rather than expected a proposed by the Government of Quebec loan, the amount of which would, indeed, be lower, there was the original expectations, which could challenge the basis for a viable solution for favourable conditions and resource arising from the state.
The first action plan, and the requirement to 12.8 million has already been rejected quebekem last spring, but applications have already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and the Plan of Action sent Minister st-pierre President of the Society for the development of the business in the culture, sodec, François macerola view that the cinematographic project excentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter proposal came into the company sodec on Tuesday.
Le parallèle and Angus have time to respond to 31 December.
However, it appears that the hypothesis of the gift from the State must be really rejected.
Let us that the association of owners of movie theaters and cinematographic Center in Quebec build against the direct investment of the state, that it is possible to buy excentrisu, usuzujíc that the Minister of Culture does not finance the project on real estate, as it did for other kinosály.
But on the contrary, a number of participants in the discussions dožadovalo major economic aid.
Daniel langlois, owner, got to the place of their cinemas during ten years of art film after he fund the construction of the complex, which could be the reason for the conversion from the Financial of the Council of the state.
The shortage of rooms for the independent films is a in montréalu, and excentris could get a steady clientele.
Company Angus et le parallèle, with Christian yaccarini in his forehead, director of the Campaign for the release of funds to the private sector, in the belief that allow the $700,000 for protlačení acquisitions.
Since the spring 2009, the only one of three film companies, le parallèle, continues in the distribution of films for excentris.
The future acquirer is open to all three halls on 27 February next year and SHOW THE MOST beautiful film xaviera Beauvois men and the gods.
But Christian yaccarini not made any reference Le devoir and so ignored, so he and his group think about proposals for reducing, which he is made.
Drawn up curtain to Canada as a whole...
New US diplomatic sources referred to in the known through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States consider inferiority complex Canadians against the Americans, but the same strike reveal their sense of superiority of the latter to Canada.
American diplomats are therefore hard that on every Canadian electorate lies at the heart of kanadsko-americké relations, if there is a vote, and believes that the visit of President Obama has helped the Conservative government to its budget was adopted in the year 2009.
Four new messages between which the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, yesterday landed on the secret to the public, provide sensitive details in addition to each other were "under the skin."
Communication with the date of 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of an election campaign, details the at what point the United States are not part of the bets on which discussed political leaders.
To the surprise, the US ambassador in Ottawa, David wilkinse.
Mr. Wilkins provides several explanation to this situation.
"The Canadian inferiority complex, almost utkvělý on possible political leaders to talk about internal betting, instead of to bear in mind that these elections are also relevant to the United States, as in the campaign on free trade in 1988," he wrote.
"The United States are therefore" concluded, "the elephant in these elections: the presence of, but potentially too threatening to be talking about them."
Ambassador means that "An instant later Silence" the less that the two countries keep intensive political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of candidate, the parties or even better, the head of the party to govern these important relations should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to vote."
Another expression of the sense of importance of can be read in a report sent on 22 January 2009, Terry breese, Chargé d 'affairs in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing the President Barack Obama on his first visit ottawy.
"Your trip will help to ensure that the government in a vote of confidence at the beginning of February, on the federal budget, which Canada publicly admits his first deficit in more than ten years, owing to the recovery plan of 30 to 40 billion dollars," writes M. breese.
There's no mention of the fact that the Government had to shelve Christmas session of Parliament to the coalition could not be defeated and that the opposition parties will determine his survival of the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another report from January 2008 and signed Ambassador wilkinsem, highlights Washington in increasingly negativnější the image that the United States shed dramatic series shot to cbc.
Ambassador is concerned about the broadcast border, little mosque on the prairie, intelligence and H2O in which can be seen not too ingenious links to maher arar," no-fly-list "or the kidnappings, for the purposes of violent interrogations by the CIA.
Another report presenting about the fact that, at their first bilateral meeting of Hillary Clinton asked his French partner Bernard Kouchner, whether Europe is prepared to accept some of the prisoners of Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner said yes, but on the basis of the principle of "a case by case basis."
At the end of the meeting, it says," to a piece of paper, regarding the Omar khadr, 15-letého Canadian origin, State Secretary of a Muslim."
"Secretary adopted with the fact that component of its review."
Poznamenejme finally, that the persons concerned by WikiLeaks, sweat.
Tom flanagan, a former advisor very close to stephenu harperovi, he said at the cbc waves, that the person responsible for this massive out should be "destroyed."
Rozhlásilo it I heard about it and Mike huckabee in the United States.
World Plan for the reconstruction of lighting
The UN yesterday proposed a plan for the reconstruction of domestic lighting in Cancun, lighting business and industrial area in 100 countries with a view to reducing the greenhouse effect, ges, who is responsible for almost one third of further restrictions, which it has to be done for the stabilisation of the planet's climate between now and 2020.
This ambitious plan is in a stage of specific projects, which the UN wants to push through in Cancun to kompenzovala the lack of difficult feasible commitments to reduce on the part of the industrialised countries.
According to yesterday the plan if a red light bulbs, which monopolizují still 50 to 70% of the market, we replace the bulbs fluokompaktními or, better yet, light bulbs with elektroluminiscentními diodes, del or "The Ice" in English, a substantial quantity of 1.8 billion tonnes, gt, ges emissions incurred on the planet for lighting, odbouralo.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the car park on the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, the big countries with a major proportion of emissions, such as the United States, China, Europe and others engaged in voluntary plans to reduce Canada, between them, which should enable the decline in global emissions ges from 53 Gt to 49 GT.
But will still be deducted from this balance 5 GT, to be achieved by the year 2020 stabilizing climate warming to 2 degrees Celsius to be excluded that doesn't get out of control.
In luminous sheets of bulbs 95% of the energy to disperse in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5% is the product of a light.
With fluokompaktními light bulbs, energy consumption reduces about 75%, and with new light bulbs with del zredukujeme this consumption of twice more.
Fluokompaktní light bulbs can stand from 6,000 to 10,000 hours on average.
New light bulbs with del, one that said this week at The Philips production - the company allegedly took part in the study of the UN - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consumes about 80% of the less energy than the hot light bulb, which gives us an idea of the potential savings with the compensation plan, which would be applied in 100 countries.
All of these new light bulbs can also work with reostaty and emit less heat.
And do not contain no mercury.
A number of experts expressed reservations about the fluokompaktním light bulbs, because they contain mercury and they need to be separate as hazardous waste, which is still possible in the developing countries, unless producers established sběrny.
However, as the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not fluokompaktní bulb, but rather a coal burning power plants that emit much mercury needed for the production of electricity promrhané in luminous sheets bulbs.
Only in the United States these headquarters give into circulation of 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report also detail States profits, which would be from this international programme of each country.
Indonesia, for example, this would save $1 billion a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power stations, whose construction would have cost 2.5 billion
Ivory Coast is eagerly awaiting the results of the election results.
The UN Secretary General, Ban ki-moon, he demanded immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Ivory Coast after the expiry of the time limits.
"Secretary General stresses the need to the Independent Election Commission has finished its work and immediately announced preliminary results, the spokesman stressed the President of the United Nations."
"calls on all parties in Ivory Coast and institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the announcement of makeshift results."
Despite the pressures made by some foreign governments let the Electoral Commission to its date - Wednesday midnight - without published the results of the three days after Sunday's skrutiniu.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the President cei on TV, confirmed that the Commission "continues to work" in order to declare the results.
On Wednesday, have proliferated in the world of calls to cei declared the winner of the second round at last, between outgoing laurentem gbagbo and a member of the opposition alassanem ouattara.
But the camp gbagbo relies on the annulment of the Constitutional Council for "fraudulent" the vote in the north, managed by former rebels of the new army, FN since a failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal affi n 'guessan, Director of the presidential election campaign in Ivory Coast, confirmed that the manoeuvres by the intimidation of voters that interned FN by a new army in the north of the country, deter the followers of the President of Ivory Coast from that to go to vote.
The elections could be rescinded if the Constitutional Council account to complaints that the application gbagbo.
But opponents of President gbagbo, they believe that the Supreme Court of the country is not neutral, because it is controlled by Paul yao n 'dré, a close political ally of President gbagbo.
Alassane ouattara, a man from the north, which dementuje any connection with the former rebels, has condemned the delay in reporting the results as "unacceptable" and asked gbagba to respect them, but didn't go so far as to be said victory.
His allies confirm that gbagbo blocking publication of the results, because he knows that suffered a loss, and to lodge a complaint with the Constitutional Council after he refused to broadcast the results of the election commission, would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections, the ongoing on Sunday, was considered the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which for years has been split into two half.
The United Nations the attention in the middle of a political faction of Ivory Coast, that could be made responsible for any violence.
Laurent gbagbo ended in the first round, 31 October as the winner with 38% of the votes, compared to 32% for alassana ouattaru, who received the public support of the former president henriho konan bédié, 25% in the first round.

Show how French leaders sought to convince Washington that the release of young French there was no compensation against the release on the freedom of the majida kakavanda, the Iranians are vězněného American injustice in France and search for illicit trading of material in favour of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, undergo a sharp light the way the French Presidency to manipulate the media, to akreditovali idea that the Syrian president, bachar al-assad, played a central role in the liberation of klotildy reissové.
In fact did nothing for it.
Diplomatic cable as detailed on 12 August 2009 in Paris has headline: "Iran: the French comments to the kind of solution in the case of the hostages."
The advisor of the Elysée Palace for Strategic Affairs, François richier, accompanied by the director of the quai d 'orsay for North afrikua Middle East, Patrice paoli, allegrone speaks with the representative of the US diplomacy.
Explain his French method.
Recommend the Americans to do this as much for to be shipped back to the country of their own nationals with violence the detainees in Iran.
"Do the noise," they say, "always strongly vyslovujte" in the media the words "fundamental rights of man," "Innocence," "the immediate release."
It is necessary to bring to the trouble the Iranian regime, sensitive to his image.
"Do it the more, the more you will ask this to end."
Because attempts were made to negotiations through the discrete channels," the silence will not solve the problem," the Iranians are "Masters on the Evasive maneuvers."
Mr. richier recalls that arrests of foreigners is "the Iranian family tactic: hostage taking for the purposes of the" political blackmail."
Indicates that the exemption klotildy reissové, which will come on August 16, the day it will provide refuge of the French Embassy," will pay high amounts of money of the Iranians "the bail of 230 thousand euros.
And to report that elysejský palace anticipates this cases of the hostages, a phenomenon that "will be vyostřovat."
The Iranians would "in the future be able to arrest other around 1800 French living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda reissová left the prison for 12 days ago, but it still remains blocked in Iran.
The information spread: íránec majid kakavand, on which the United States claim that he was deported for illegal trade in electronic products sensitive in relation to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of the decision of the judge.
The American Embassy, as well as many observers queries on this worrying match.
For Washington, which pursues illegal Iranian network to obtain material destined for the nuclear program is the opening majida khakavanda bad news.
France has taken the initiative to bargain?
The Iranians for the liberation of the young French?
In another interview with Kathleen allegrone, September 4, François richier assured that this is not the case.
Elysejský palace, he says, was not only "Judge" shocked by this decision, but he sought a way to stand up against it.
"There were talks between the Presidency and the Minister of Justice," at the time, michèle alliot-marie, but "the French Government is unable to change the decision of the court," he notes.
Mr. richier wants also to demonstrate that majid kakavand is under "limited" the supervision of the French intelligence services.
Advisor to the Elysée Palace is making a phone number, keeps hanging up on the phone and then inform the American diplomat, that íránec is currently in Paris buildings of the Iranian Embassy."
At the time of the arrests klotildy reissové in Iran is developing a elysejský palace efforts, negotiate, through the communiqué and organized "leakage" to the media, trying to convince that Syrian President bachar al-assad plays a "important" and "influential" role "mediátora."
Americans are watching this activity not without irony and find that handling is now bearing fruit, because a number of articles in the press reflects the official version.
A telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes media "blest" of the French officials."
What is based on this level of "," expressed gratitude to M. assadovi, to question the Embassy in Paris.
"Despite their statements full of chvalořečí French Official officials in private recognise that they have only vague idea of what haul did in fact."
Document then deals with the reasons that forced elysejský palace to pay in the fiction.
Intense communication "is bound to validate the policies of President of Sarkozy's opening to Syria," analyzes.
The policy pursued in 2008 "was observed a number of critical voices in France and abroad and marked as premature and undeserved."
That," as exaggerating the Syrian role," the Paris is seeking to "demonstrate Syria, what chvalořeči can vysloužit when plays a constructive role in the region."
It also aims to "to plant grain this between Syria and Iran."
American Embassy knows it from a very good resources.
August 11, François richier he said: "Of course, we don't know the haul something done, whatever it is."
"But still, we thank them."
"It would be at least bring chaos and confusion between the Iranians."
Klotilda reissová is returning to France 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy is taking it in the Elysée Palace.
In a press thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in favour of the liberation of our krajanky."
The end of online games after midnight for young they
South Korean government adopts the Law entitled "peciválský," which will prohibit adolescentům play online games after midnight, the fact that block access to them, responsible government officials said.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December, in order to be able to ask companies operating online games for blocking access to these Games after midnight to anyone under 16 years old, said officials of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry for the family.
"Many children plays these Games all night and then have problems with learning in school and are not able to lead a normal life during the day."
"We do not believe that this law is necessary for it to could be ensured their health and their right to sleep," said Jo rin for AFP, a leading official of the ministry, which is in charge of the bill.
Online games will be newly accessible from 6 hours in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The Government also provides, to ask the companies to reduce daily time access to these games for the young, whose parents ask for it, said owner.
People who request it, can also be available free programs to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "affected" and the daily press regularly provides various facts associated with intensive use of the Internet.
The country is at the same time the undisputed master of the world's competitions in online games.
In November of South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, and that in the face of the 58 other nations.
The World Cup in the years 2018-2022: FIFA establishes the host country.
Full of unrest because of suspicion of corruption laid down in the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday of the host country of the World Cup in years of 2018 and 2022, selection Supreme politically motivated, where the battle for influence and lobbying run the risk that will prevail over the technical criteria.
The thing is sure of the Royal competition FIFA in the year 2018se will take place in Europe, the traditional strongholds of this discipline - 4 candidates: England, Russia, španělsko-portugalsko, nizozemí-belgie.
In the year 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hopes that it will be able to conquer new territory by Qatar, Australia after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to work in the introduction to the United States or on the east, Japan, South Korea,.
List of figures that will participate in the framework of the delegation of David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the prince of Qatar, head of the government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, beckham, cruyff, is able to form an idea about the scale of the economic and political bets all over the world.
The negotiations in the wings faces the risk that will last until the last minute.
For the rest of it is difficult to determine the hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to the assessment report FIFA documentation of English, španělsko-portugalská, 2018, and American, 2022, contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons do not have too much weight for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the hour of specified for the vote.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the European Commission's revelations, leading to the suspension of two members of the CE /?/For the corruption, reynald temarii et Amos adamu. Maybe that destroyed the chance of their country, the cradle of football, which has hosted the World Championships only once, in the year.
BBC this in Monday's crown when broadcast a documentary that "on the pin" Three influential members of the CE by European Commission?, Ricardo teixeira, Nicolas leoz and issa hayatou.
How to make FIFA nespokojenou and bring English leaders with David Cameron into trouble in the first place.
Prime Minister hopes that he will repeat the move, which worked his predecessors as Tony Blair, who has managed to get in 2005 London for the organisation of the Olympic Games in 2012.
This intensive activity will be enough to England added a new shine to her name on the marking by European Commission??
Nothing is less certain, because the two španělsko-portugalsko has trumps has already prepared the stadiums, his advice, world championships in 1982 in Spain, the Olympic Games in 1992, and their football culture in Barcelona, euro-2004 in Portugal.
But the bleak economic and financial perspective of the two countries could give these ambitions of a cold shower.
Possible reprisals against angličanům and doubts about the competence of Spain and Portugal have only increased the position of Russia, which has been outsider in spite of the gaps in his dossier by stadiums, hotels, transport.
But Prime Minister Vladimir poutin decided that the nepřemístí to, Zurich and publicly declared "unfair competition in preparing the vote," In a word only barely gnarled innuendo on the English press charges against members of the CE, of the European Commission.
"We will be after them throw mud, we are going to try the means to compromise herself," said Mr. poutin.
For the year 2022 appear to be a logical favorite of the United States, with their extensive experience in 1994.
The best performance of the economy in the world, the headquarters of the main sponsors of FIFA, it seems that this country has a big ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, produce the beautiful project.
But these applications seem to be premature for both countries, which together in the year 2002 has had a "test."
Another threat: the World Cup 2026: China, which very much wants FIFA, has made Asian chance for the year 2022 invalid.
With the katarem, who pulled out of his sleeve big ace in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion in new lands, but the two countries are more risk than securities.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for a weak charges TV, due to shift paid European countries, comprising a powerful force for the FIFA.
A second mandate: zřejmost by the Security
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand woke the appearance that hesitate.
Valery Giscard d 'Estaing and Jacques Chirac nezaváhali not at all.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they do.
The mandate of elysejskému palace calling someone else.
The current head of state will be a candidate in the year 2012.
But zřejmost is not in good compliance with the share of the secret associated with the Presidency functions.
So it is important to do, as it doubts the continuation of constantly.
In one sense, in the second.
In 2006, without it wanted to believe, the Friends of Jacques Chirac will make claims that third mandate has been excluded.
15 November with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy said that "he decides" sometime in the fall of 2011.
How the UMP recalls before the Members of Parliament on Wednesday night in the Elysée Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" planted a feverish status.
It was the official announcement of his candidacy?
Was not far from it.
President only mentioned that the adjustment of the Constitution in 2008 would limit the number of five years for two terms of office.
It was just a statement from his party, not notice.
This is not the first time that recalls at such meetings humorným tone of presidential elections.
"In the worst case, or in the best case scenario, you are still to go seven and a half years in July 2009 with me," he said.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Do not think that neuvažuji about the next stage."
His předvčerejší statements, it will make the candidate of more than the previous day; do not make him candidate or less.
If caused comments, it's because of the double the truth.
Speeding up a path to the candidacy of the PS, on the one hand.
But that's not the entry into the arena ségolèna Royal what pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to be convicted.
It is because that his candidacy in the year of 2012, it is clear that many in the PS want arrangements to battle reports early rather than intended.
A survey on the other.
First, the right voters would prefer candidacy Francois Fillon, before the candidacy of Nicolas Sarkozy, 46% against 44%, according to bva-l 'Express.
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing this matter with the UMP," responded immediately and warily people from the vicinity of the Prime Minister.
"If they believe can defeat, would stand," be communicated to Mr raffarin.
"will still believe that it can win," repairs Alain juppé, balanced with zřejmostí.
The euro: the European Central Bank to continue in their purchases of titles.
The last session of the Council of Governors central in the year should be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for bringing out of the crisis or, at least, the announcement of stopping a large number of unusual operations of monetary policy, which must be completed by the end of this year.
Crisis of sovereign European claims obliges Institute for issuing securities undoubtedly cannot afford to be so insistent under the threat of the deterioration of the situation now so tense in European markets, with securities.
Political price would in this case was about that higher.
On the occasion of the press conference yesterday French Finance Minister Christine lagarde to pay tribute to the active role played by the European Central bank in favour of a solution to the debt crisis of the European states.
She didn't want to say whether they think that the bank may have to do more, for example, by that it would increase its programme of the purchase of sovereign bonds.
"I reserve their account for my European partners,...."
The night before, in Brussels, during his interrogation by the Commission for Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, appeared as výřečnější in terms of its intentions, and was content with the fact that the program said that the purchase of state titles in the secondary market "is continuing," and that "we will see how we will decide" during the meeting, to be held this Thursday.
The only certainty: the European Central Bank will watch their basic constant interest rate to 1%, its historically low levels since May 2009.
In fact the purchases of Treasury bonds by the European Central Bank has doubled in the last week to Nearly 1.35 billion euros.
And thanks to the nerozumnosti dohodců on the market has made yesterday new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
Overall, the central banks of the Eurosystem bought to 67 billion euros from May 2010.
Among dealers in the market anticipating the impacts on the continuation of purchases do not no doubt, see party 29.
Even economists do not expect no significant change of course.
If the operation of loans for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the European Central Bank, is this the latter bank to the unlimited provide liquidity according to the generous conditions and the duration from one week within three months.
Economists now expect that this mechanism will be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine that would change its program in a significant way."
"If not, that would be to accept the risk of causing the short term of the new tensions," says Michael schubert, economist at Commerzbank gained.
"a progressive opening announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipates Norbert bräms, an economist with Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan their intervention in the market with the public debt," would have to the European Central Bank to keep purchase volume of its bonds, to revive the faint market," attached Norbert bräms.
With regard to the European Bank exposure to the markets of sovereign debt in the euro area is away on the selection of nothing other than to maintain their presence on the market.
"needs to replace the lack of investors in the market at all costs and to act in a way to prevent the outbreak of pay - I. performance States belonging to witness significant yesterday between the most fragile," administrator bonds.
Because if interest rates rose and, the States will be all the more trouble to reduced its debt burden, the place to be stabilized.
It is saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government hrbí back
After the beginning of the week for Italy worrying the situation more relaxed, yesterday with the stream of obligačních of interest for 10 years.
A return to the temporary peace.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister for the economy of regions said that they heard Giulia Tremonti to qualify the situation as "nerozřešitelnou" and that he expects "unpredictable" weekend, which then zúčastněny dementoval.
In any case, on Tuesday deviation from long German interest reached a record 210 basis points and the price of contracts on the cover against the risk of bankruptcy, CDs, soared to 263 points, which caused some excitement in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the bias with German interest rates were more than 400 basis points.
But his right hand, Gianni letta, by itself has said that it is "too busy" "stormy developments of the markets" and the possible contagion originating from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, there is no such as Greece and Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is as Portugal," explains Irwin stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the lack of growth and weak fiscal input, which goes hand in hand and exposes it to the state at risk, that it will not be able to meet its needs of financing.
Last forecast in Brussels was a cold shower for the government.
Italy's growth is expected from now on to 1.1% in 2011 and to 1.4% in the year 2012... while a budget that is available to the Senate for his analysis, to 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, kalkuluje, the European Commission, will be a deficit of public finances 4.3% of the gross domestic product in the next year, against 3.9% of the suspected government and 3.5% in the year of 2012, instead of 2.7%.
Hence the story of the new summary amendments to the draft state budget, which could be put in place after the holidays, of 7 billion euros.
"If it is necessary, they will have to be adopted by the new strict measures," the Commissioner for economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy is taking the support of the international institutions.
"The keystone of its economy is in order and its calculations are correct, we repeat that for a long time," assures arrigo sadun, an Italian member of the Management Board of the International Monetary Fund, the International Monetary Fund under the pressure of Italy.
"There's no immediate problem, or short or long term, because through its significant debt, 119,2% of the gross domestic product of the year 2011, ndlr, is efforts to stabilize the required in Italy, less than the efforts required from other countries," notes Pier Carlo padoan, chief economist of the ocde.
There is a question of political instability.
14 December Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies and subsequently after May start to organise the elections, which is planned at the end of March.
During the period started to be so, little suitable for a decision in the case of a serious crisis.
Europeans thought about the strengthening of the anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine lagarde it reiterated yesterday within the framework of a press conference in Paris: "I think that Europeans demonstrated on Sunday in the course of the day and night, are obviously very determined, committed to defend its currency and its currency zone of solidarity."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded the expansion of the interest on the European state bonds, brought water to the mill to governments and the European Central Bank.
But we can't even talk about the beginning of normalization.
Office for the notation of Standard & Poor's announced that it could swarming over the record of the debt of Portugal, the objectives, which is most focused various speculation.
"Because there is real insufficiently transparent and clear policy in May, specifically on the banking systems," says economists exane BNP Paribas.
The more that "Political Time running more slowly than the time market."
Aware of this suspended the context and the danger that they is hiding, intensify it European countries discussions aimed at strengthening the existing emergency mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the Ministry of Finance, the most concerned the problem, and in the wider scale with their counterparts of the G20 is developing very well.
And it with regard to the meeting of the Eurogroup, eurogroupe and the Ecofin group from the beginning of next week.
Meeting of the European Central Bank will be held today.
On the agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to support countries in the euro area, focusing on the markets, see above.
When it comes to the European Finance Fund - fesf, and its chief executive officer, Klaus regling, zapořčal in Tuesday in Singapore, the road to Asia, in order to inform investors from the Far East on the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of this trip is not to raise funds, depriving it surely land to achieve this goal.
The first issue of the securities fesf foreseen for next month.
Yesterday, the US official representative told the Reuters agency, that the United States will support any increase mobilized additional funding direct through engagement in fmi.
Country, of which it is in the front row, Portugal, and Spain, are being prepared to take the structural reforms, particularly in terms of organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are attached to the stringent measures with quick effect.
Lisbon and Madrid another way than used Greece and Ireland.
Both countries are eager to avoid at all costs, that would apply for the international aid before make use of their own budget korektivy and than decide on structural reforms necessary to once again have lasting confidence.
Kapitáloví participants in European funds is finally on the options available for the acceleration of the normalization process of the markets with sovereign bonds.
On his way to Paris November 24, Axel Weber came up with the idea of whether wouldn't be 750 billion euros mobilized Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union wouldn't hesitate to draw on the supply of securities.
Economists from barclays capital, which is a player very first Trade Plan with European sovereign debt, asserting that the addition of about 100 billion euros would be fine," better "in the form of direct provide financial liquidity.
Resource exists: it is a European Financial Stability Mechanism, the subsidized 60 billion euros on that date.
The Council, which has all the chance to be tested in the European capitals.

Paris metro grand: the first financial proposals
Since it is a discussion on the modernization of transport on ile-de-france in full swing, it's raining billion.
At least during the discussion.
We particularly 23 billion in the metro grand Paris, which is to build the company Societe du Grand Paris.
To ensure that this development could be started, announced a grant of $4 billion euros.
Purely in theory is that amount, which would then allow companies SGP used on part of the procurement of funding from its double resources.
Today, finally brings us to the first dodatkům.
Rectifying plant law on funding from the year 2010, which examines the financial committee of the National Assembly of today in the morning, contains mechanisms laid down to ensure these resources.
Are two: the creation of special taxes on equipment and increase taxes from offices to ile-de-france.
First, tells us, in the text of the draft law, the Article 15, is "in favour of the public institutions Societe du Grand Paris."
Is calculated: "proceeds from this interest is 117 million euros per year."
The second is the reconstruction of the rates for the office, which already exists," to be upgraded to increase proceeds derived from it, and that this would affect the company Societe du Grand Paris."
How much it would gain?
A mirage.
It is not vyčísleno in the text.
We have a long way to 4 billion.
"It is clarified that these fiscal resources shall be annexed to the 4 billion euros of capital subsidies, which will be mobilized by the State and inserted into the company Societe du Grand Paris by project" can be read in the explanation of the reasons.
Us in the company of the SGP this system seems shocking.
"Since we've created the revenue of both tax, ndlr, we can cover the study for a period of three years and then hrábnout to 4 billion, explains here."
"It will be incorporated into the budget and used as necessary."
SGP company has considered that 4 billion will be credited to the year 2013 for the budget for the year 2014.
This mechanism, in which 4 promised billion are still an absent abonentům risks that will cause some of the work of the parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be 7 December.
Vindictive hackers and přičinliví spy
WikiLeaks case has two meanings.
On the one hand, it is discovered an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears to be the scandal only in the face of hypocrisy, that the relations between states, the people and the press.
On the other hand, it talks about the deep changes on the international level, and anticipates the future ruled by regression.
But, let us move in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, it's the fact that each document established by the Secret Service confirmation of any nation, consists exclusively of press cuts.
"extraordinary" of Americans on the sexual life of Berlusconi's is to announce what had already for months, everyone can read in any newspaper - all in addition to those two Berlusconi owns, and the karikaturní profile kadáfího was for a long time for the entertainer artist topic for the sketches.
The rule that the secret documents may consist only of the reports have already known, it is essential in the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
When you go into a bookshop, dedicated to the ezoterické literature, you will see that repeat each work of art, on graalu, mystery rennes-le-château, templářích or zednářích. Exactly what has already been written in previous works.
And not only because the author of the occult texts to searching for new information, or they don't know where to find the reports of a nonexistent, but because those who are the occult believes only what they already know and what confirms what previously learned.
This is a mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same is true for secret documents.
The informant is lazy, and lazy, or a limited spirit, head of the secret services, and if not, it could be, as I know, the editor at the paper Libération, which considers true only what he himself admits.
Information with high suppression of Berlusconi, which the US Embassy sent a resort, have been the same, which newsweek published a week before.
So, why is around the revelations of these documents it so much fuss?
On the one hand say what every cultured person already knows, namely that the embassy, at least since the end of World War II and from the time when the Heads of State of the phone, or may leave the plane for common dinner, lost his diplomatic post and, with the exception of a few small exercise in representing the transformovaly in intelligence.
Any spectator that films about the investigation knows very well that the only from licoměrnosti seemingly ignoring it.
Nevertheless, the fact that it is repeated public, dishonours duty of hypocrisy and a bad light on the American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can get the classified information of the most powerful country in the world is a hard blow, not negligible, for the prestige of the state policy.
Scandal affects both victims and his "executors."
But let us move on from here to a profound truth about what happened.
Once, in times of Orwell's, it was possible to have all the power, as a Big Brother who controlled every move of its people.
Orvellovo prophecy was demonstrated since thanks to the possibility of controlling every move through the phone, each of this transaction, navštívený hotel, used the highway, and so on, became a citizen of total victims FUNERAL WREATHS of power.
But when demonstrujeme, as it is now, that even "tomb" with nejtajnějšími information of powerful can't resist the intervention of a a hacker is no longer a control report one way and becomes the circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen - may know all the secrets of power.
How can maintain power, which has already has the opportunity to keep their own secrets?
It is true that already Georg simmel said that the true secret is bezobsažné secret, and bezobsažné secrets cannot be never revealed of; it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi's or Merkel is really a mysterious bezobsažným secret, because it is were pulled from a public life; but to detect, as it did WikiLeaks, that the secret of Hillary Clinton was bezobsažnými secrets, means withdraw, as appropriate, him all the power.
WikiLeaks didn't make any mistake with Sarkozy or Merkel, but carried out by something big Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wounds bestowed upon the powers so significant?
It is clear that in the future states will not be able to send sensitive information online - that would amount to its publication on a poster vylepeném on the street corner.
But also it is quite clear that under current technologies is unnecessary hopes that it can be sustained in secret report on the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out whether and when the Head of State traveling by air and joined with some of his colleagues.
How can be maintained in the future in the private and sensitive news?
I am well aware that for the moment, the forecast is on science fiction and so it is fantastic, but I must think of government officials, who are carrying discreetly meeting the formalities for uncontrolled routes and wear only those with him a message that they know from memory, or rather shelter rare information in her heel shoes.
Information will be maintained in unique copies in drawers concluded the key: All in all, the attempted espionage in the Watergate affair had less success than WikiLeaks.
I've had the opportunity to explain that the technology is now moving sideways forward, that means backwards.
A century after the Wireless Telegraph meant a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitoval Telegraph based on the wire by telephone.
Video of analogue, to love the movies scan film step by step, move it forward and backward and expose all the secrets of the Assembly, while now CD - digital, allow only jump after chapters, that is, after makroporcích.
Through rychlovlaků we get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the air travel and transport, which includes we need three and a half hours.
Therefore it is not extraordinary that policy and communications technology will revert to the cars towed horses.
The last note.
Sometimes, the press tried to understand what had a secret embassy.

Climate: how France hackla its promises on the financing
A year after the agreement of Copenhagen, it's time to try the compliance with the promises to quickly odblokovaná the financing of point of financing with the Quick Start by fast start or premature, implemented the developed countries.
And the French hacky were discovered
In the Copenhagen agreement with the developed countries committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars in the years 2010-2012.
The European Union has promised 7.2 billion euros for three years and France of 1.26 billion euros, that is 420 million per year.
At the start of cop16 EU pulled out big ace to convince its partners on the viability of its commitment on the financing of fast start: advanced action report of its Member States, the press conference, Grand side of the event, the distribution of leaflets.
Priceless transparent operations and recognized on their real value: The developed countries and the civil society would like to see them all developed countries, and civil society, as well and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announced that in the year 2010, release of 2.2 billion euros, which brings it to the right way to adhere to its promise of 7.2 billion in the year 2012.
But if we look at the detail, we see that things are much more complicated.
These funds are in accordance with the agreement of Copenhagen," new and additional "to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without would be to the detriment of public assistance for development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what constitutes "a new and additional."
While the European Commission proposed the harmonisation of some Member States, among others, France, block the process.
Today, everyone selects the reference that fits him best.
The European Commission, for example, was considered reference 2009: international funding to preserve and she adds even more into it 150 million to three years, the financing of the fast start.
Other countries chosen to take similar references with annual payment terms or with dates on the level of public assistance for development.
By contrast, France has considered that "All new financing projects" are "new and additional" by 2010.
In other words, there's no reference to the spending of the previous period or to a global level of public support for the development of the D 'aide health in the development.
Specifically, the total amount of the aid of France towards developing countries may remain constant, or even reduce should honor its commitment on the financing of "new and additional..."
Another decisive element is the division on grants and loans.
Still there, there is no rule and everyone will choose its own way of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that, EUR 1 rental equal to 1 EUR a gift.
Obviously it is difficult to sound: trying to is not přirovnatelná.
If the use of loans can be proved for Some investments, which are profitable, often for the projects related to reducing the emissions of more efficient technologies, is a foolish we present one euro, which, as the equivalent of one of the euro, which we, uh, we should not be understood by virtue of its commitments, but as the cost of borrowing for věřitelskou country, i.e. the equivalent of interest rates.
But France may submit only such reasons: "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros, of which he is 91,5% of the loan, of 389,8 million euros and 8.5% of gifts, helped million euro - see the EU document to think it could prove themselves.
Is the only country of the Union, which on this scale use a loan.
Germany to require 46% from here, while Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia, among others, comply with their commitments with 100% of the donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union will give EUR 1, within the framework of his promise of satisfaction, France can only 10 centimes and considers this a comparable effort.
Beautiful kejklířský piece!
For in its funding of "fast start" France operates with dual šejdířstvím: on the one hand with the development of shares in time and, on the other hand, with the real financial loads.
Although spends only helped million euros, can convince them that directs 420 million euros "new and additional" in relation to their promises.
Manipulation of the Minister of Finance, because it seems that, even though it is bercy, who was such a decision, could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU, why would the Member States continue the donation, when just to lend? - and in negotiations, as developing countries are not completely naive.
Chapter early funding it is only a otázečkou, relatively short, in relation to a series of discussions on the climate.
But it could be a grain of sand in addition, in a huge machine that is UNFCCC.
Hopefully, that is not the case.
Whether it is about anything, it is necessary to draw experience from this first year early funding.
First, France should announce a change in its way of the accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for their obligations and decency and justice for the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid the debate on deposits in long term financing, the other major chapter in the current time, diskutovaná,: neunikneme issue "dodatečnosti" or on the way of the posting loans.
France should change its position in order to become so pokrokářská for these deposits, as is the other.
Therefore hope all inserted into the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs kosciusko-morizetové, which arrives in cancunu next week.
Surprising announcement on the fast start of France and its vision of a "dodatečnosti" and the use of loans could cause an increase in the level of international confidence needed to be to proceed further in the discussions.
The alarm on pesticides, which they have digested children.
Ten years child was eaten one day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published this Wednesday from the association of future generations, ex the Movement for Rights and the conservation of future generations.
Association, which points out that the results "DO NOT have a significant statistical value with regard to the low number of test samples, but they are characteristic of zpracovávanou purchased the issue," between July and September food normally consumed by in four of the Food and one light food as a light lunch for one child roughly ten years in supermarkets in l 'oise and in Paris.
The typical food, including an official recommendation - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 litres of water a day - as well as sweets, research laboratories have been analysed on chemical substances, pesticides and heavy metals and other polluting factors.
The balance of plate is overwhelming: 81 of chemical substances, of which 42 is among carcinogenic substances, possible or likely, and five substances are among clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as a troublesome for the gland with internal secretions, PE, according to the study by several institutions, such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
"Even if in almost all cases of legal limits for each chemical adopted individually are not exceeded well in our research we can see that the reality in the consumer exposure kontaminujícím carcinogenic substances, perhaps, and/or PE It is amazing," says Association.
Butter for breakfast and tea with milk alone contain about ten résiduí with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven as some carcinogens, as is the case with about 20 residue that might compromise the hormonal system.
Apple, imported from Brazil, the studies as a snack, contains traces of chemical substances, including in France of six disabled fungicidní resource.
The same is true for green beans from kenyi, involved in the lunch, for which studies traces of strong insecticides was banned in the EU.
Moreover, steak in a tin of minced meat, tuna and even bread and gum were prošpikované pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water from the tap analysis revealed the presence of nitrate and chloroform.
Steak of salmon for dinner was "the richest" with 34 objevenými chemical reziduy and even the analysis of plastic plates used to Fast heating food in a microwave oven, nevyhnula analysis.
Final risk to consumers of this "cocktails contaminants" is probably underestimated "the result of the study.
The environmental evropa-zelení, ee-lv, suggested "in the face of the urgent situation" establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, to stop "the increase of civilization diseases."
In July, the study of the European Agency for food safety, EFSA, examined the state of the presence of such residues 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereáliích.
