Lack of snow on the mountains haunts the hotel owners
Scneelose runways Sorgenn not only the giant mountains - residents.
The lack of snow discourages people from appointment of Skiaufenthalte in hotels and pensions.
It can therefore in giant still free room for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are often visited.
The people go through the offers, the prices, but now they have fear, binding.
And if they call us immediately, whether we believe that this year's Christmas on snow or " to see " will be the operator of the information portal Spindl. Info, Martin Jandura.
Those who stay in the New Year's Eve Spindelmühle just after his ideas, should no longer with the appointment.
Anyone who prefers saving and the quality of the stay in second place, can try to wait a few days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer for the New Year's Eve day mostly
I think that they will seek to sell them for a while, but then they have to give in and for shorter periods.
And then the free rooms will be quickly, Jandura.
Free beds in all winter dates is always the travel office Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet sold out.
In our offer is about half of the seats are still free.
That is why we have prepared some cheaper Christmas visits to the last moment, the director of the travel agents Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Silvestertag in Giant can offer the Vrchlabi - travel agency, but there are fewer free seats.
Good (also find the first 14 days in February, the rest of the winter dates are sold on average.
This year is the interest for the winter were also negatively affected by that Giant always no snow.
The people are waiting to see whether snow falls.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
Should be verschneit the runways within a week, will also be sold out this Christmas, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and slightly better than last year, manages to fill the rooms in the hotel in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas we have only a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February, will run the business as well, the director of the best Pec hotels, Karel Rada.
About 80 percent for the New Year's Eve is also the hotel Omnia in central parking in Janske Lazne occupied.
Remains to Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne even half the beds.
Pleasantly surprised us in January this year, for which we are currently at around 60 percent occupied.
A bit weaker is now the February, but at the moment, when the snow comes, is the interest in the placements in Giant, the director of the Erik Sporysch.
On a more snow mess the Giant - hotel owners now.
On Thursday, it should cool and if it rains, the snow on the mountains.
But then again, a warming, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the site of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove.
United States: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comical, with what Schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the President with his reputation of the brightest, the strategy of his predecessor in the issue of Afghanistan, which he even for the most stupid.
When he finally his anxiously awaited ausschwitzte Afghanistan doctrine, it is that those on the copy paper from the Bush Iraq Szenariovor three years ago.
Not only that, in the text itself, he used the phrase " as in Iraq, he has even used the name of the Bush statement in January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: " new Vorwärtsweg " without hesitation.
He has even three years ago, the Bush idea - fresh troop contributions in the troubled by the civil war in Iraq - as " irresponsible and in their conclusions karastrophische decision ".
Subsequent months showed that the recommendations of the military, Bush is the only possible and was very successful in the sense that we are now in the news about Iraq.
Bush's reputation has not improved, because he has left his successor a much dankbarere starting situation, as it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle repeatedly.
In order to increase the contingent have again asked the military, especially the supreme commander of the Afghanistan operation, General Stanley McCristal, even despite the Subordinationsgewohnheiten trench in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers in order to reverse the situation for the better.
The President has three months, but no better idea and he has betrayed the General wenistens about 10,000 soldiers.
For Europe, he has the promise of another 5,000, even though he himself.
Highly problematic for the Obama strategy is its plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the increase in the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Also, despite the fratricidal war in recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well - structured, their leaders pay tribute to the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the cons indication - on any one can leave and there are no agreements.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, which are used every day to change their mind.
The political institutions, even if they were established formally correct, leaves only licence buildings, behind which the patriarchal tribe relations further.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the confusion of the conditions that the Pakistan and Iran - influences.
The building of a " strong state ", which is the minimalist objective of the whole operation is very unrealistic.
Time horizon of the Obama strategy by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years has worsened the situation in Afghanistan and now it is on the verge of explosion.
To believe that the small soldiers in the war cry broke out on the " early " here is a miracle, can only create a truly romantic soul, is not influenced by facts.
From the political point of view is the date for the withdrawal of irresponsibility, because the Taliban as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan, is running out.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their constituents, in the security of Germany or Italy with the war in the Hindu Kush Gebirgsvorland.
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not work, the United States is a very serious question of whether the problem is not with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America after Obama the winner withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation plaster for Barack Obama is the fact that three years left before the presidential election, and therefore, there is still enough time, so that he can resort to a different strategy, this would prove to be a total loss.

A group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of money, but they can sell only in five years.
In addition, the shares the managers in the case if they act too risky.
Goldman Sachs is so according to the Reuters news agency at the forefront of efforts to link the premium Wall Street bonuses with long - term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street on the further direction is aware, in which it has to go, the former banker of the society, Douglas Elliott, JPMorgan.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs was the target of criticism for the first three quarters of this year, almost $17 billion dollars set aside for bonuses.
The total amount of premiums bonuses in the course of this Jahra, according to the Reuters news agency reported today despite the measure exceed $20 billion.
The high premiums bonuses in the banking sector, with the start of the financial crisis in a whole series of Länders has become the hottest political issue.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to the bonuses of the bankers, the £25,000, with a tax of 50 per cent.
Similar steps are also preparing for France.

Minister Janota is considering the resignation. Klaus has invited him into the castle
President Vaclav Klaus on Friday morning at the Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, about his continued presence in the government, because it with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form in which this has been released by the Assembly on Wednesday, does not agree.
It is thought that the budget and perhaps also the continued presence of Janota cabinet in the themes of the Friday meeting.
The budget will also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, as the crisis in public finances.
On the meeting of the presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
On the future in his capacity Janota on Monday with the prime minister, Jan Fischer, negotiate.
After the budget bill, which now receives Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
In Parliament, but on Wednesday on the Left Party proposals for money and the money for the civil servants ' salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and direct wages of farmers.
The government has the proposals of the social democracy that they increase the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party, on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and legal party, on the other hand, is therefore a sharp domestic political dispute, of the question mark over the future work of the official cabinet, on the design of the ODS and CSSD and Green Party in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was approved by Parliament, the package of austerity measures imposed by the Fischer - government in the fall, and that is the public debt.
Klaus, who is the law on the state budget, but not to sign, said today the discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that the politicians of the " serious problem " that " the unsustainable deficit " of public finances have neglected, a longer period of time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution.
An improvement could only bring a strong government, which still on a broader consensus among the political parties.
The ODS, Mirek Topolanek, that the budget is terrible, and the government should weigh their continued existence.
The ODS, deputy chairman, Petr Necas, the CTK said that the concept of the cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
Premier Fischer described in the editorial similar words as a " strong worry. "
The CSSD leader, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek - words that the budget deficit is that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and 200 billion kronor.
On Wednesday, the CSSD the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was satisfied.
Mandela was in the new film by Clint Eastwood played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans say that the new Hollywood film " Invictus: the Ungeschlagene " of the world, much of the country from its fight and victories despite some criticisms that the main role of an American actor.
The story tells of sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid system of government in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in his life history of the American Oscar - actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela was asked whether he could be in the film.
A further important role Matt Damon.
I said to him: " If I play, I must take you.
The zweiundsiebzigjährige actors, the price for his role in the drama from the Boxbereich " million dollar baby " had received, the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, the end of the slave owners, a fictional US president, and also in " Evan Almighty God ", but rarely someone who is still alive, and for many people is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was for his active activity at the end of apartheid in the South African Republic of 27 years in prison.
He was released in 1990 to undfür four years he was president of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
" Invictus " is the Latin word for " ungeschlagen ", and at the same time, this is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was to speak as he
The film recounts a true story, in which Nelson Mandela his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, leading to the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people even after apartheid and economically.
He believes that he can reach people through sport, so he decides, the rugby players, the outsiders, in the world.
Finally, the South African team to the World of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela - history on the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role, these as closely as possible to the reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak, as he has.
The actor said, if he and the world leaders would be in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, to eat with him and in his speech to be behind the scenes.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela's hand.
I noticed when I give you the hand schüttele, I accept your energy, they will be transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what they are, he said.
For me, it is important to become a different person.
Matt Damon is in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have prevailed.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him, as he Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember when I rang the door bell, that he opened up and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life, was: ' in the film, I see a lot more from '.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actor in comparison with their actual role models, he has led the director Eastwood " Invictus: Ungeschlagen " received positive reviews and we are also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his assessment in the following words: " That was a very good story, very well executed film. "
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes. com, has Invictus 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret on Norway dissolved: the Russians have tested a missile
Norway was a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry has admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
The launch was not successfully and the type of " Bulava " missile, which was the pride of the Russian army, is becoming a nightmare of Russian generals and the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His presence on the ground on the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not at all or been damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers about " Bulava " than a " flies. "
A missile, which flies, but do not
This is already 13 attempt, was at the beginning of normal.
Only at the end of the flight, in turn, technical damage to the rocket.
Presumably the engine exploded in the third stage.
This time, " Bulava " from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij under the water of the White Sea.
This Raketentyp allows the firing from the submarine.
It is likely that the mysterious light caused by an unspecified object on North because actually was the damaged " Bulava "
In addition, the Norwegians since the first moment not doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals has diesesmal challenged and claims that it is not clear from a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket fell and the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases were damaged the engines in the first stage.
Although no test launch was carried out without a mistake, the leadership of the Defense Ministry only six of 13 for unsuccessful.
The nearly 50% success so the generals met with optimism and so will continue to claim that the " Bulava " will fly again without problems and even to ten nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tonnes.

Czech discovery: a substance, which is also in ' like ' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists testing new compounds, the spread of HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that he is also the viruses that are resistant to drugs.
This fact against the disadvantage is that the link to normal virus variants are not as strong as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured.
The patients, the drug but can prolong the lives and prevent the reproduction of the HIV virus in the body.
But their income is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the virus, also has the development sg. resistentviren, against the medicines are no more effective.
The work of the experts from the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences, from the VSCHT (chemical technological University) Prague, from the University of Heidelberg opens the way, how to deal with the virus - resistant.
They have proven that the substances on the protein known as the substance, which is responsible for the expansion of the HIV Viruses.
The Metalokarborane are links from Bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus reproduction in other ways than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists to new ' improved ties, which have been prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their attachment to the viral protein substance.
The Metalokarborane have a unique three - dimensional structure: two vielfächige cages from, hydrogen and carbon atoms, and through a metal atom, in this case, cobalt, are linked.
Heimtückisches and constant virus
HIV Protease is protein substance of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus - caused by the HIV virus division would not mature infectious virus particles.
If we eliminate the HIV Protease, we call the propagation of the virus in the body of the patient, the scientists in the press report, by the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work in the Science paper was published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe all ranks of the compounds, in which two couples the cages (see table) by a brief organic chain, further.
A weaker, but reliable
The impact of this series of substances against the HIV Protease wurdne tested in place, even against their steady (resistant) variants, which were won by HIV - infected patients.
The impact of the Metalokarborane in the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinical use of medicines, but they do not lose their effect on the resistant variants, against the medicines are often ineffective.
The unique effect mechanism and its other properties, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical ways, the Metalokarboranen to interesting links for further research, on the development of effective drugs against HIV says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the laboratory for structural biology of the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and the Institute for molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over budget. ODS fishermen, the Fights Back
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as " terrifying " and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, in his view, their continued existence.
The statement of the ODS, described the prime minister as a " strong words. "
It is time for the analysis.
The deputy ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the officials with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
After the Prime Minister Necas must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament, when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it is to remain in office through the Parliament left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed to depart, Necas pointed out.
Parliament on Wednesday adopted the budget for the year 2010, but with Link party amendments on more than 12 billion kronor.
Parliament has the money for civil servants ' salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the social democracy that they increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic, with a backlog of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, it is the desire of the government, because the amended budget is only a less bad version of the budget provisional Frase not clear.
Frustration and futility
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has argued that the government's assessment of the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota seriously with his resignation in the event that the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
According to the Czech Television has Janota on Monday after the government business in the Premier.
He has indicated that he will remain in office.
The reason is his disappointment on the Verhandugn of the budget.
To what extent fishermen for the fight with the budget deficit, so that, in accordance with Nominanten the Social Democrats (CSSD) , the changes in the budget, the government had nothing to do.
The Premier should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament adopts continue to deficit - boosting laws, for example, sick pay and pensions or the service should be changed.
Topolanek: the ODS nominated ministers were not
This is a matter for the Prime Minister, fishermen and the government.
The ODS nominated ministers have made no mistakes, Topolanek said in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function, people who are to top 09, voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that, if fishermen decided to in the fight against the deficit of public finances, " it is completely logical and correct that it is based on the left - wing majority in Parliament, which is at the moment ".
He then allegedly with the support and tolerance of the Civic Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if it will be, then I will deal with it, said the citizens of the Democrats nominated Defence Minister Martin Bartak journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer flew in the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS came at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time that the ODS probably on Wednesday in Parliament would vote against the revised budget, if the Premier ask Members of the Civic Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We are not as orphans, we are not small children, as he responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the leader of the party in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I have not noticed that my vote would be lacking.
As I withdrew to the mandate, I knew that in coming months, especially at Bolschewisierung of Parliament and destruction of all positives, Topolanek itself.

Whether the tense situation in South Africa, that will show.
The white South Africans are sceptical, such as, for example, in a recent interview rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who has betrayed the country, fled to Britain.

Jancura collects complaint for libel against three head of the CSSD.
The owner of the student Agency, Radim Jancura, criminal proceedings for libel against three social - democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of southern Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a zwanzigminütigen Inteview on radio Journal.
The complaint is linked to the efforts of the company, the regional trains in some districts.
All regions, but ultimately the long - term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three heads us and say that we take the cherries, we have made the offer only on the size, as it was voted with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways, because we would know the prices of the Czech railways, were completed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend.
Because of this defamation of society student Agency, said Jancura radio Journal.
At the same time, he gave was that he has evidence from all districts that they have made their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek, the collection of the complaint for the further continuation of the media show of Jancura him as free advertising for his company and for his own person.

He was a Member of the CSSD, I know who they are, I am not saying his name, said the radio Journal today.
Vaccination against Pneumokokken free of charge and
Imfung against Pneumokokken changes from January the usual.
It is a first for the families for free and voluntary.
But now, that the mandatory - vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against Pneumokokken.
The medicine institute already set the maximum price of the vaccines, which have to pay for health insurance.
The experts are also on the vaccination procedure in the clear.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for August - children
From January can be vaccinated against Pneumokokken children free of charge, on 2 August last year and later were born.
The condition st that they have not received a vaccine dose.
Anyone who has begun with the vaccination in the last year or earlier, must also pay weitereWiederholungsimpfung itself.
The first dose of vaccine should be between 3 and 5 month of life of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of the families to vaccinate their children against Pneumokokken.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses.
As a whole, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccination doses of 300,000 to 450,000 kronor per year.
They save but in the treatment, which would need the children without vaccination.
Until now, the state for all land vaccination of children spent around $500,000 per year.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so - called Janota package.
Pneumokokken Mittelohrentzündung, but also cause serious infections including Gehirnhautentzündungen and blood poisoning.
By Pneumokokkeninfektionen die in our investigation in hospitals per year up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years.
Outside of the Czech Republic was the duty - vaccination of children against Pneumokokken in some 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccine could be required in the future.
From January to paid by the insurance and voluntary.
That the compulsory vaccination would be better, for example, the head of the citizens association, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association already in the long term for the Pneumokokken vaccination.
The experts at the international conference, which was involved in our Association, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
That is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have succeeded, at least.
I believe that this is the way we must go now, led Kalovsky.
The Health Ministry wants but the vaccination procedure against Pneumokokken cannot change.
At this moment, we are not at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say the doctors.
The chairman of the society of practical Kinderärzten, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then it could be on the reduction of vaccination number " in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this is voluntary, " says allerdingst Cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80 percent of the parents to vaccinate their infants against Pneumokokken from next year.
Vaccination against Pneumokokken is also speaking, that this was the first to land vaccination will be paid for by the health insurance and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money for prevention, so that they save for further treatment, erkärt Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This is a concern of the practical children doctors, the purchase of vaccines.
After the initial project the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and doctors receive in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
Some Members feared that the insurance so " the money from the health insurance could lead. "
Therefore, the doctors will buy the vaccines themselves and have to wait until the insurance companies pay for them.
According to the estimates, the individual practitioners have to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
Still they and we
Can Islam French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters have voted for a ban on building minarets and the concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a thorough and thoughtful report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the avowedly säkularisiertesten societies of Europe and be integrated.
Some readers will this new book from admiration for the work of the author: " Why do the French no love " (original title: " Why the French Don't Like Headscarves ") (2006) , an elegant and densely argumentierenden study of a contentious issue, which the country about one and a half decades and employed and whose effects are still visible.
Bowens neustes book offers a more comprehensive and kühneres spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he would like to know not only what the politicians and the media about Islam in France, but what is happening on the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, now the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls " Islamic space ".
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students, on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim in a mosque or a City hall (or both) ?
Should be lectured young Muslims about evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marrying a non - Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim, to use an interest - oriented banking system in order to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane matters, he claims, the daily life, in contrast to the political drama, the media.
The author acknowledges a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a familiar name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss - born Arab - Muslim scholars and academics.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible, on the one hand, a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists interviewed Bowen, are with their Salafi counterparts usually divided - supporters of the puristischen Sunni Islam, with Saudi Arabia - which is a small but influential presence show among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a convention requires a give and take on both sides.
He queries whether the French political decision - makers (and the intellectual elite, so passionate the separation of church and state) really committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may be a rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who had to make their historic compromise with the secular Republicanism.
He sees a " tightening of the values " as a growing pragmatism.
Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say " yes, but not yet. "

Admiral Nelsons encounter with a polar bears as a brave 14 - year - old Fähnrich sea, only with the rifle his Muskete fought, is certainly a myth, but others are true.
Young bears, which, as they have been caught behind the bodies of their mothers, were recently killed in zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears in a vision.
Even today Zooanlagen still typically a millionth of the life of a wild Alttiers. The climate is rarely appropriate: the Eisbär in Singapore was quite green of the algae that grow in the hollow hair of his skin.

Contractor of the US government of Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban government has a contractor to the US government, mobile phones and Notebook computers sold in the country, arrested, said representatives of the Foreign Ministry on Saturday.
The contractor, has not yet been identified, works for Development alternatives, Inc., with headquarters in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients, such as USAID, the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Konsularbeamte the interests of the United States in Havana to try to gain access to the prisoner, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not yet been published, although after Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitors for almost everything, on charges of " endangering " can be arrested.
All so - called counter - revolutionary activities, which include mild protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti - government graffiti and statements are regarded as a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, which is led by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband by government representatives and attacked.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractors will probably increase the tension between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a " slow " approach to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new US policy stresses that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban government is taking concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and create more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks in Cuba are legal, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of a government employees is $15 per month.
The Cuban government allowed ordinary citizens only since this year, the purchase of a mobile phone, they will be used for the sending of text messages, as a 15 - minute telephone conversation a day would cost.
The Internet use is restricted on the island.
It is in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors and some government agencies, such as universities, accessible.
Cubans who want to connect to the government, often have their names.
Too many websites is restricted access.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens in Cuba are in prison for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesman for the US representation in Havana.
Berbena said she could give no further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that in any other free society the tax - free mobile phones is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently a harsh report on the freedom in Cuba, with the title " new Castro, Cuba ", an allusion to the investiture of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, which replaced the ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants often within a day were arrested, convicted and imprisoned.
He said that any solution would be politically and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when both countries for more dialogue.
Pakistani government officials plan to meet to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy, five men from northern Virginia to send to Afghanistan in order to kill US soldiers, and said that they hope this case could help to uncover a vast network of terrorist the Internet after radicalised young men.
Investigators said that they had a shadowy insurgents, known as Saifullah, had sought, the men had been invited to Pakistan after he had made, because one of them on the Internet video site YouTube favourable comments to terrorist attacks.
Saifullah, after their arrival in Pakistan, the leaders of the men and tried to help them to reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who was briefed on the matter, said on Saturday, the Al Qaeda leaders are not convinced that the men are not part of a conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held in the eastern city of Sargodha, far removed from the inhospitable mountains in the north - west, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government officials who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government officials said that the men were not discouraged and continue to try to get the right advice to gain access to the Al Qaeda camps, when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and interviewed by the FBI - underlines the vital role of recruiting in the identification of future terrorists and possibly even more important, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, has made it a matter of the utmost urgency, human asset within Al Qaeda.
The Gangmasters act as guardians of the organization, which is not let those whose commitment to the holy war seriously enough and those that might be spies.
American would - be recruits from A Qaeda a special examination, said analysts.
Because of their potential access to US and its propaganda value, but they are also regarded as hugely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst of the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that terrorist groups in recent years have become much more cautious about whom they are allowed access, because the US intelligence experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to get someone in these groups, what better way could go, as the recruitment model to follow, which so many have followed, Kohlmann said.
The model is based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators are calling in Copenhagen climate " Action "
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded by the negotiators in the Bella conference centre in the city of bold action on climate change.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while the police estimates of around 25,000.
The event passed off relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists small explosive devices in the vicinity of a number of government buildings in the inner city.
On a day when the UN - sponsored climate talks little happened, thousands of activists with banners through the city, in English, " there is no Planet B " and one in Spanish, the declared " the Earth says ' enough '.
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the Fotografin Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the country of their birth mother, her heart has to with the type of problems the country because of the already significant effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I have decided to participate in the large demonstration - pass to the floor and to appeal to the world leaders to an fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around the results.
The police kept the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella centre and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either mitführten or pocket knife.
According to Danish law, these actions during demonstrations are banned.
According to a witness, who did not want to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators burned in black clothes several explosive devices in the vicinity of the main canal, near where several ministries.
They threw them in the vicinity of the building, he said and added that it began as a flares, but then followed by " a few large explosions ".
Inside the conference Centre of the people on television screens to the afternoon, the demonstration.
But the protest has the awareness of the main officials, such as Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator, apparently not.
When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration would have a positive impact on the international considerations, he replied in English: " this is something that I was not even aware of. "
He then in Mandarin and said: " because of the venue is great, I cannot hear what is happening out there. "
He noted that from the perspective of the individual, whether the demonstration would hurt or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, " you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people ".
Test data show persistent racial divide
The certificates to mathematics performance last week was welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the District of Washington is still far behind the schools in the country, the maximum benefits, the evidence show that the fourth - and in the past two years faster progress than cities, Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made.
But in the latest figures from the National Assessment of educational Progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is included, is the persistent achievement gap between African - American and white pupils, both at local and national level.
The average score of white Viertklässler from Washington D. C. in the last two years of 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) , their African - American counterparts, but only three points from 209 to 212.
In reality, the performance gap between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African - American Achtklässler remained essentially the same, he fell a statistically negligible point of 245 to 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data, because the sample size was not big enough.
The picture over a six - year period is not encouraging.
The gap, the white and black Viertklässler separated in 2003, when the first NAEP was covered in this district, 60 scale points (262 to 202) .
And although the item number, the children of both groups have grown in that time span, has been reduced the difference with 58 points.
Some education advocates of the district last week expressed its concern that the results of schools Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty, for the most part of white students, who are already strong children.
This suggests that the overall assessment by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale, which is complicated and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of the board of D. C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for the educational equality in Washington D. C..
I will not for a period of two or three points, and, said the democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of Eaton primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said, that the message of the study is that the middle schools in the city need urgent attention.
Of course, you would always see the positive signs, I respect.
What frightens me, however, is that we are not near the time and energy that we use for our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the current weak pupils.
This autumn, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson reading system, aimed at pupils in the upper classes of the elementary school and middle school, the basic skills of reading have not mastered at the beginning of their school career and the significantly behind their classmates.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum, from kindergarten to sixth - class games and life experience to the fore, under the former chief schools inspector Clifford Janey brought to Washington and this curriculum, some of which were reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to the best measures the pupils to benefit under the central level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the performance of the system and will provide the additional money and resources for the current weak schools which are necessary in order to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, the urban audit results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms at the schools in the poorest areas of Washington D. C..
The objective could create political fallout work against this important agenda item.
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors that they tried to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the districts, so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for closing the achievement gap, is the traditional public school year, which is currently in Washington, to extend 180 days, in order to compete with charter schools.
We must increase the school year to nearly 200 days, in order to have the power to change, said Janey, with his teachers ' union last year to reach an agreement on 185 days per year, which he called " a milestone " on the road to a major increase in the next Treaty.
Higher education for more people than a future
The coach reached the Gettysburg College with a loud pipes.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, and blinzelt a moment at the sight of the white pillars of the brick facade and the lawn.
Gracielas parents have completed the High School in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, in silver Spring was recovered and now lives in Riverdale, never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and the other Achtklässler the group, explore the Gettysburg, where the teaching 38.690 dollars per year, was more of a respectful visitor, rather than the future students.
" Yes, I will soon be here! " cried Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the leaders announced that they had entered the building for natural sciences.
" Wow, really? " she said, as the low teacher - to - student ratio of the school reported.
The college in Pennsylvania was the seventh, the children in their three - day tour and now they have the intended message completely: the question is not whether it's college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States, Hispanic immigrants, the High School does not end or as a teenager, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands, of what the college is in the middle class.
In truth, one of five of these " second generation " of Hispanoamerikaner the college - which is a remarkable achievement, given that many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, in the United States, without the High School.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because it for a generation, which will play a huge role in the labor force in the country, show the way forward.
Those who study powerful children, say, they often have a natural affinity for the school and its inherent momentum to success.
Many of them have parents who give their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But advisory programmes also play a major role by Graciela and millions of children as they help to college, especially if these efforts over a longer period of time.
If you look at low - income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help the Wegsuche through the system, it will be a single measure at any time does not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California at Davis, students.
We must consider, for these children a supporting network of pre - school up through the High School.
The federal program, which had financed Gracielas college tour, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR up - a gang run high - and is more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems available to college preparation programs to launch the start, if low - income students in the middle school and continue until they have completed High school.
According to the US Department of Education has helped the program since 1999, more than 10 million students, of which more than 60% in college.
Iraqi oil ministry includes contracts with foreign oil companies from 10
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government on Saturday completed auctions in two major oil companies can get to rebuild its damaged infrastructure.
The 10 contracts with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi Ölministeriums suggests that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies have only shares in two of the 10 auctioned for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made a priority, has drawn the short straw.
Two American companies have been able to conclude contracts for versteigerte fields in June.
The sparsely gesäten representatives of American oil companies in the opening up of the Iraqi oil industry analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war and instead of US companies give Asian and European path, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further bids in Iraq.
Security concerns were highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability by the withdrawal of the US military, American oil companies have probably analysts said to be more involved in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
US companies were in some cases, because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state - controlled energy companies costs and more risks, because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies, have been able to conclude the contracts with the ministry.
Major U. S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close relations with the Iraqi oil ministry and in recent years, with technical advice, are empty.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state - owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered for more contracts than any other companies with large packages of contracts for two major fields go home.
We all know, said the spokesman for the Ölministeriums, Assam Jihad that China is on the way, one of the big players of the world economy, as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company with its measured Mitbietern and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
For the commandment levy vorausgewählte companies gave commandments, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil, the ministry was willing to pay to the emission of each field to increase beyond the current level.

Senior UN envoy in Kabul will resign
The senior UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, which would end a stormy tenure, the allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election has been tarnished.
Oath redundancy, as the Obama administration has decided to send a further 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed his concerns about the fact that the US timetable for military withdrawal, which is to begin in 18 months, other NATO governments to withdraw its forces.
We need to accelerate the development of the Afghan security forces and will send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
This commitment must be long term.
The Norwegian diplomat urged the United States and other military powers, to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to help in the political transition of Afghanistan.
The troop increase on the military side, an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he does not resign his office, but only one in March 2008 to his family agreement, only two years to remain in Kabul.
He said that he wanted the notification of UN
Secretary - General Ban Ki - moon now, so that he had time to look for a replacement.
What I have said, is that it is better to seek a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two - month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has, according to UN representatives with the search for a replacement.
The UN officials say that the Swedish - Italian - descended Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean - Marie Guéhenno, the previous UN peacekeeping operations has taken into consideration.
Oath position in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to cover up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the allegations of Galbraith, who was fired, " the mission have undoubtedly damaged, because it is already a great deal of scepticism about the international interference in the election ".
Eide said that he has recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the aid of the American - led forces in Afghanistan.
He entered the UN leadership allows his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries who donate to the Afghan mission, and said that it would strengthen their confidence that their money is used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the restriction of its forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN recruitment rules have undermined its ability to introduce capable people.
The UN rules are such that I since May, he said, only one person.
This is disastrous and must not continue.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran must reckon with additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon be " significant additional sanctions " on Iran, because he did not take part in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a 7 - day tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 U. S. soldiers in northern Iraq and the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good options, he said in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such a development.
" One of the things on the soul, is, if we in the last six years have learned something from Iraq, the war own Unvorhersagbarkeit. "
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package, aimed at the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians.
He said that a " package of incentives and " is necessary " in order to convince the Iranian government that it is protected with nuclear weapons, in reality, less " because " their people will suffer terribly " under the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from the spokesman for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American government, the European leaders in the warning that Iran must reckon with " credible " consequences if he with its nuclear program to the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran maintains that the knowledge of nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said that he would resume the talks to curb its nuclear program, and a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for much - needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has pushed for this type of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to win time for negotiations.
Iran, but since that time the negotiations on the interim agreement to leave, in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
Iran, the international community in relation to some of the proposals, which they had already agreed in early October, has simply has, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way, as they did in conjunction with important additional sanctions on Iran have never been, Gates said.
President Obama has set the 31 Dez. as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called " crippling sanctions ".
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian representative at the United Nations, which it on Thursday, " baseless and unfounded allegations " of certain members of the Security Council called on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers in order to achieve an appropriate long - term solution. "
Gates, who last Friday should return to Washington, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning, before it in the oil - rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and the Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular in relation to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to prevent delays of US plans to reduce the American troop strength by the end of August to 50,000
Gates also sought to allay the Kurdish concern about the imminent withdrawal of troops. US Representative quoted Gates, Masood Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, said: " We will your security, your well - being and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
A change of direction in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband, surrounded by propaganda posters on them lectures that " mother earth is too tired to have more children " and " a baby means one more tomb. "
These lessons have you learned that, as well as government officials in Shanghai, by the low birth rate and ageing population in this summer, suddenly began to change course and young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and definitive: " under no circumstances ".
We have all of our time and energy invested in a child.
For a second child is nothing left, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8 - month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one - child policy in China, the two generations of notoriously dicklichen, spoiled Einzelkindern, who are affectionately called " little emperors ", has produced a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate is at 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 at the time, as this policy came into force, the UN
Department of population issues, while the number of the population of 60 years and older by 2020 from 16.7 percent of the population by the year 2050 to 31.1 percent rise exponentially. This is well above the global average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is in rich coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai, stronger.
Last year, 60 years and older accounted for almost 22 percent of reported residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate of one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, the head of the Shanghai population and family planning Commission has said that couples should receive normal reproductive age babies, in order to help to reduce the proportion of the ageing population and to alleviate the labor shortage in the future ".
Shanghai will soon " as old -- but not so rich -- as the industrialised countries, such as Japan and Sweden, " she said.
A gradual easing
Enshrined in the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one - child policy would be the most controversial, which was introduced by the ruling Communist Party until today.
Couples who are against this policy, must reckon with huge fines -- up on her triple annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese state officials have attributed to this policy, that the critical demands on natural resources could be avoided, while human rights activists have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials pregnant women who have already had a child, forced to.
Many couples have had to carry out sex - selective abortions, ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for population gradually their position on the one - child policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been Einzelkinder -- and 2007 was the tone of many hard slogans.
Qiao Xiao Chun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that the government recently even more radical changes, for example, to allow couples to have two children, which is a child.
Shanghai in July, the first Chinese city, which has launched an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Posters, belehrten family, only to have a child, have been replaced almost overnight by directives, which describe in detail, who for a second child, and how to apply for the permit.
The city government has sent municipal employees and volunteers for family planning, for couples to visit home and information sheets under the doors.
They also asked, psychological and financial advice for the available, which have more than one child.
The response was not encouraging, said family planning officials.
Disappointing response
Although officials from a rural town in the external areas of Shanghai, said that a recovery in the requests from couples to see after the launch of the campaign for a second child, the urban districts reported no change.
In the municipality with a population of 115 000 than example still only four to five requests per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that the expected number of births in the city despite the campaign is still around 165.000 -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipal Caolu, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give her the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juan Juan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and this is legally permitted.
But they have, how many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance from the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West to assess the one - child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer, whose wife is seven months pregnant with her first child.
Yes, it is robbing us the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples be psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, the personnel chief, said that they would like to just one child, because she was also a Einzelkind. " We were the focus of the family and that everyone around us.
We are not accustomed to care for others and do not want to do this. "
Chen Zijian, a 42 - year - old, a translation company, said it plain.
For parents from the middle class with dual career, through which the birth rate is falling, he said, it is to be successful and we must be selfish.
The age group of 20 to 39 - year - old grew so that their parents during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment to see and they want a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, makes huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up their social life for at least two years.
Then there is the question -- " we must rebuild his home " -- and the -- " if the child is 9 months old, we have a CV for the best nursery schools. "
Most of his friends are ready, this one time, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to have achieved a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want too many victims.
UN group plan to reduce emissions
The UN - sponsored climate conference -- which until now by wild posturing and mutual has set on Friday with the publication of a document, a priority for the next 40 years, recording an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases, with the industrialized nations in the near future would have to shoulder the biggest burden.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has both the remaining obstacles, as also shown the way forward.
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation, the time next week, more than 100 leaders from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was written by a specially created for the UN working group, is silent on the amount of money from the rich countries to poor countries, so that we can meet these short - and long - term global warming.
He also offers a range of options for the key questions, including how developed and major emerging countries limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global rise in temperature, the political decision - makers.
The process will be given a great deal of flexibility, John Coequyt, a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, the six - page document, has a 180 - page negotiating text, in order to focus on what the leading representatives of the UN climate change, Yvo de Boer, described as " the big picture ".
It shows the outline of a possible agreement, in which the industrial nations together their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent, compared with the levels of 1990, while major developing countries to reduce their emissions in the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The talks on Friday, the European Community has also given a boost by their assurance, over the next three years, 3.6 billion dollars per year to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from the masters of floods and droughts and avoiding deforestation.
The Friday expressed the same verbal fireworks, what the talks in the past week.
The U. S. climate envoy Todd Stern has rejected, the binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, demand, if they are not funded by the industrialized nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration a tougher line with China, as a representative of the Bush administration, not even two years ago.
The United States will sign an agreement, without major emerging countries stand up and take action, so Stern, who also lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave its opinion one hour after the declaration of the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, stating that the leading US climate negotiator either of " common sense " or " highly irresponsible " of him was that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States, China would help to tackle global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of the major world powers is at stake, both within the industrial nations, as well as between the industrialized nations and emerging fault lines.
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to save the planet, with China and the United States because of their respective commitments, while poorer countries that the two dozen influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers, who should bear the costs of the slowing down of the greenhouse gas emissions, because even affected countries have begun to act more aggressively, the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions to account for their actions.
It is clear that this is a game, which will develop a new economic domination, Ulate, who is also a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are exposed to the effects of climate change, said that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, though the leading participants say that the talks in the best case will lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members presented on early Friday morning, a 24 - page draft treaty.
Artur Runge - Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states, " political pressure on the entire political process, " in part because they are now united and measures of the emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency, as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues before the arrival of the government leaders need to be resolved to reach an agreement.
Senior representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister entstiegen their aircraft and around through the corridors of the Bella Center meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, during the next week.
The sheer scale of the Assembly -- 13,000 people daily in Congress Centre and, gitarrespielende activists hold late - night shows, in which they are the countries who betrayed and sell, and draft treaty passed from hand to hand rather than by e - mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity builds just: almost all important ministers are now here and as of Wednesday, 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to the top League, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of the organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights.
Britain's first 225 km/h speed train defined the Monday feeling new
Monday morning at 5 13 will be a pipe through the darkness to announce a train departing, a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first high - speed commuter train in the country will be in his lightning trip from Ashfort, Kent, to London St Pancras 225 km/h and 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the transport minister, will then Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin - commuter services from London.
He hopes that the new service to Britain finally to an international rail network faster and more reliable trains and the major urban areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could be vibrant commuter towns, Arbeitsanfahrtszeiten would radically reduced and the change of plane and car to train the national carbon emissions and reduce congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main parties believe in this vision.
But the many billion British pounds, for the construction of a new national network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage in the British high - speed tracks still the brakes.
High Speed Two (HS2) , a company based in January, the government should submit a feasibility study, Lord Adonis, according to the Times report on 30 December.
This gives him a detailed route map of the next stage of the high - speed rail network.
The new rail line, linking London with the West Midlands, with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places where the impact on the environment are controversial.
The free site will be the plan the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final stretch.
HS2 will also have three options for a larger, northwards leading high - speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a Y - shaped route, in which a single high - speed link in the West Midlands.
The route would be in or near Birmingham and a Abzweig would west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in the North East after Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
" It seems to be the most viable option, " said a railways insider.
After the completion of the journey time between London and Edinburgh in 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part of the route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow the travellers, the London - Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour to go.
The proposal would offer the opportunity, with a speed of 400 km/h, which the British rail network would be the quickest of Europe.
The first route was planned that 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can travel to.
Up to 18 trains per hour on the London - Birmingham in operation.
This in turn would mean that a terminus in London, would be on the 20,000 passengers per hour could be dealt.
Given the space limitations in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be extended to the high - speed network.
Rail experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan, in his opinion, should be continued, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken until after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network to be built in sections.
The trains would have to switch from the high - speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, and the journey time between London and Scotland in about three hours.
This is seen as a key sticking point, so that a switch from air to rail can be a beacon for the rail revolution.

The normal level RBS mortgage rates dropped from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where he is still standing.
The latest from the House of Commons published documents show that Duncan in this May continue to be entitled to 1.250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month.
Duncan lost his job in September as leader of the opposition of the House of Commons, after an Undercover reporter filmed him, as he said after the expenses scandal that " of meagre rations " would live.

He said: " I have spent my money for my garden and entitled to a tiny part of what is measured.
And I would call for the whole damn sum, but I do not do it. "
The Member, millionaire from his former career as Ölgroßhändler, was attacked because of his for the first time in May, when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before he had checked with the Fees Office that this " could be considered excessive demand. "
An activist has a protest in Duncans lawn a hole in the form of a pound mark, after it became known that he was about three years, 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) .
When he was interviewed last night on the increased mortgage, Duncan said: " This has been approved both by the Fees Office, and subsequent by Legg to value increase. "
He added: " There is no debate about branching out and Durchschlängeln or a bend the rules or similar.
Everything is completely transparent and strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be clean and clear. "

The UDF (Union for French Democracy) will vigorously and calls the party Nouveau Centre, not to use their mark
The party alliance, which is monitored by François Bayrou's party Modem, on Friday to a takeover attempt of the mark, once by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing party, the chairman of the party Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, reacted sharply and asked him under threat of prosecution, this to use in any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to take the UDF Siegel, because he is of the opinion that would not be worthy of this political legacy to defend, after he had left the hand.
The defence minister, whose party partner the UMP is, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
On the strength of his efforts, he had the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now in NC) , which has a claim on the property of the trademark UDF, since he was the first this brand of 2004 the Institut National de la propriété industrial " has requested.
However, the office of the friends of François Bayrou's party alliance UDF silence and clearly gave us to understand that they are not expropriate and the ministers and MPs under threat of prosecution a deadline, this not to use and her to transfer the property rights of the brand.
They have made in the last few days, a number of statements that you would suggest your political movement, the UDF Siegelzu + +, wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
They probably thought that you have the right to the name of this movement + Nouveau centre, the today's UDF +, on their political material, as well as the starting side of your website.
As you know, you have no right to the use of this mark, said the secretariat of the UDF and calls for the party in NC, " immediately the mention of the name UDF of sämtlichem material and (their) website to remove.
Also asked Mr Hervé de Charette " to the property rights of the trademark of their legal right to transfer. "
If you refuse, we will take action against you, in order to ensure respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, warned the undersigned.
In their letter, they stress that " UDF " since 1978, is a fully - fledged political movement and recall that Morin and his friends " have made the choice to leave this in order to start a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, the party " UMP ".
The party Nouveau centre has, therefore, the undersigned, no rights, the UDF Siegel (Union pour la démocratie française) .
They continue to remind you that the last Congress of the UDF 2007 the three - year membership of the party Modem and the establishment of a secretariat to defend " the material and moral interests " of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, has passed.
What Mr Hervé de Charette, the secretariat, " he was at the time, as he has requested, the brand name for three years, is no longer a member of the UDF, " but the UMP.
He benefited on scandalous and fraudulent, the absence of the deposit of the Akronyms UDF to carry out this for themselves.
They continue to bear in mind that this recklessness on the best ways to turn into a criminal offence, and ironisieren the strategy of the NC: " It seems to us, but in politics, as in life, to make a name for themselves, instead of trying to come out of anonymity, by, of a name that has no legal rights.

This is an excellent news (...) . The report will show that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady, which must be protected, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt, a criminal complaint against François - Marie Banier, photographer and Allroundkünstler, and accused him of the weakness of their mother for years to have exploited to grants totalling one billion euros in the form of cheques, insurance policies or.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt has always been refuted by the photographers, which she sees as a longtime friend.
Although the court would have to assess the admissibility of the action by Mrs Bettencourt - Meyers, the Plaidoyers of lawyers on Friday led to a large family debacle.
So, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt to three of his Klientin at their letters (1999, 2003 and 2005) , in which she wrote that the husband of Françoise Bettencourt - Meyers.
According to her lawyer Liliane beds Court the following: " could you please explain to my daughter that I fifteen years, once or twice a day to Banier wrote.
Françoise, I have never been more talk since their marriage. "
The public prosecutor of Nanterre is of the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to respond, especially because a judge in recent days has rejected their request, a judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt " is fully capable of law, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act on their behalf, " the representative of the prosecutor, Marie - Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to deliver a verdict after the trial on the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt Meyers has taken place.
Managers revolution or the end of the Strategic early education?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the major French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence in vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to his staff, said the position of the consumer from the marketing revolution: it is to join the staff " values " for the best, as it was earlier in the consumer products of the technicians in the station.
By the customer in the heart of the company has the marketing revolution the strategies of the conquest of the markets in the ground ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors preferences of customers to impose regularly again!
A demobilisation of staff can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon, especially the employees affected.
These demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of F, even more importantly, to those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IU (Intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) " by all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward - looking vision "; by the staff of a deployment, which the instructions of the authoritarian management.
We therefore call for an occupational revolution, which would be the staff at the heart of the concerns of the company on an equal footing with the customers.
The very - related benefits of internal polls
The internal polls, as the questionnaire, the Orange has made his wage earners, this revolution in relation to the management practice?
I fear that, unfortunately, not.
- First, because I could see that the whole structure with a new situation after many detours, finally, to do ... what it has always done.
Also because the authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power in proportion to the importance of his own failures.
And finally, because most leaders a very simplified view of human behavior.
Emerged from the great engineering schools is their interpretation of the psychology mechanistic.
They play by intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory, which was recently by the US " neuroscience " and unknowingly far - reaching research institutes and through the media.
Thus, and it suggests that it is possible, the " leverage " (sic) on the involvement of employees, a aktuellein Le Figaro. fr published by Ipsos poll in a position to a mechanistic control system, which is unsuitable for today's world.
The mobilisation factors identify and measure
Instead, a necessary for the smooth functioning of the modern business the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It is, in any idea or practice of management to integrate a fundamental record: for wage - earners is the commitment to the company will only be possible if it is clearly as a means to achieve a portion of their dreams, their ambition and their projects.
Currently only the studies from the multifunctional analysis of this conception of the motivation of the staff.
These studies have shown that their companies on the basis of a Doxa judge them by their perceived image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of these factors can predict the executives of the companies ' social services ", and anticipate and their human resource management back to the right place.
So they create a fertile ground for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech by Oslo: the " just war " brings Obama praise from the right one
The American rights on Friday welcomed by Barack Obama on the eve of talks in Oslo and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of " just war " against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, the awarding of the prize to Obama had mocked on 9 October, applauded the speech by the president, the example of the former vice - presidential candidate in the elections of 2008 following Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin said, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today and added that they themselves the subject of a " necessary " war in its recently published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last of which I think that the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We must stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, was in Oslo on Thursday to justify the use of force; a way to explain his Entscheidungvon nine days ago, to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, took the view that the Präsdent in Oslo have done a very good job ".
I found that the speech was really very good, frohlockte the former President of the House of Representatives, particularly the reference to " the existence of evil in the world, " in the words of Obama's recognized.
In some parts of this speech totally perceived as historic, Ginrich said in the radio programme " The take away has been questioned.
The former Member of Parliament, which some see as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said he was pleased to have seen a " president of the left ", the members of the Nobel Committee noted that they were " not free and a price for peace, if the use of force would not exist. "
For Michael Gerson, a former scribe of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has " a very American speech ".
In addition, that he is a " cosmopolitan ", as he always does, " he said, " as an American president, " as he pointed out that the Europeans, " as in a security bubble, which they do not themselves have created for their protection, and they do not, " Gerson.
Among the few, not convinced rights called the former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a hawk in the Bush era, the speech on the website of the National Review Online as " boring, "
On the left of the President of the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich worried about how Barack Obama defended the recourse to the armed forces.
Packaged the war under the guise of the judiciary, to justify the massacre of the innocents, quite simply, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, remains on the side of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still of the opinion that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama, described the speech itself for a speaker, who is known for his talent, as a " monumental ".
The speech in Oslo " offers a plan for the management of international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression, " the California newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama " the necessary discourse " and described his speech as " bleak and exemplary " at the same time.
Drivers: three marathon for an agreement that ensures the supply of Christmas

The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport) .
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages rise from 8.72 on 9.06 euros.
" It is not very much, but once we start small, " Patrice Clos (FO) .
The activists are now instructed not to block the supply centers.
" it will probably always be some recalcitrant who are not satisfied with the agreement, " he added.
The TLF - chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a " good agreement ", although it was difficult to give these wage increases in the face of international competition ".
According to him, the increase in 170 euros a month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wages.
" This agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the employees, " maxim Dumont (CFDT) , while Thierry Douine (CFTC) of " a historic agreement ".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) on this matter, " an acceptable compromise. "
The agreement also provides for an increase in the cost of travel by 3% and the upholding of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow it, in particular, the issue of monthly salary and the modernisation of the collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that " the sinking of the burden on the employers to the tune of 100 million was the subject of an amendment to the government the corrected finances for 2009, which was adopted during the night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government calls " an identical " vote by the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows that the agreement for the first of this organisation affiliated companies, and then in the event of an extension by the minister for the entire profession.
This will be the case " in a very short period of time ", Bussereau.
The opposition of the employers ' associations can only delay the process.
The federation FNTR lambasted a " fraudulent trading ", because the 100 million euro " were the sector to offset a portion of the carbon tax has already been promised. "
The secretary of state for transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but the bird - eaters in the approaching Christmas days, laments the Unostra.
For the association Otre threatens the agreement " small and medium - sized companies in the sector over the next 12 months, a lot of digging. "

New Silicon Valley
For many years it was a secret city, for Western visitors inaccessible.
Selenograd, one in ten districts of the capital, Moscow, was in the Soviet Union, a closely guarded secret location for defence research.
Today, the community with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Centre of Moscow, as " Russian Silicon Valley. "
Major research and production facilities for micro and nano electronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives Selenograds contacts to Frankfurt science location Riedberg - with the Uniinstituten and the firms of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ) .
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg in Frankfurt a " protocol on closer cooperation. "
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, Planungsdezernent Edwin Black.
2010 will be representatives of the FIZ and small and medium - sized enterprises in the science Foschungsschwerpunkts for a seminar after Selenograd.
Scientific exchanges
It is a continuous scientific exchanges.
But it is also about economic relations.
The FIZ firms will be allowed in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, want to Russian science firms contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include for example, the Moscow Institute for electron technology, the big corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaja
The community was founded in 1958 as a so - called " socialist planned city " for the defence research.
Selenograd (literally translated as " green city ") got its name from the forested hills landscape, in which the research institutes are embedded.
Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not high enough.
For the supporters of the project is purely and simply " the new heart of Europe ".
Right. S21 is much more than the deeper set of a railway station, more than a gigantic construction project, which the City of Baden - Württemberg land capital for a decade in utter chaos.
Stuttgart 21 is from the spirit of the 1980's.
Head stations with tracks, right in the middle of the city, were at that time as transport technical fossils of the 19th century, who appeared as a modern rail transport, as it once was a huge amount of time, locomotives from behind.
, A go - to go further.
And that is why the head stations disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, about half - way through the trans - European rail route between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava the slogan of " the heart of Europe ".
S21 will now actually addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realised that it is in the results and the Bavarian city is almost impossible to implement the down.
Head stations have no entry and exit problem any more, however, since there are modern locomotives and tax cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 and the new route after Ulm is now being addressed.
Regional and local politicians have.
The train with power, because the risks of the largest infrastructure Einzelprojekts the Republic of taxpayers and not the state corporation.
Städtebaulich is still reasonably justify the project.
It creates new city area, which is the computer generated graphics of the planners - with a lot of green.
For the transport system S21 is harmful.
The transit station and the development are intended for the movement, which one - typically 1980s - huge growth.
At that time, there was not the competition from budget airlines.
Modern transport policy, but it must first to strengthen the freight transport, because the transport by rail is much cleaner than by lorries on the roads.
But the new route is not because of intense climbs for freight trains.
Far more serious is that S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
Good six billion euros in the Schwäbischen are buried.
This is the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion for realistic.
It is, in the next decade will be the money to other hubs and the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the transport ministry.
One of the most important is the development of the 180 - kilometer route through the Rheintal.
Since 1987, is being built on the route in slow motion.
Is urgently needed, right here on the tube.
But S21 will act as a brake.
The Rheintalstrecke will become the bottle neck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government is considering verdict on the Airport
The provincial government has left open in the Wiesbadener project whether they will go against the judgment of the Administrative Court (VGH) in review.

Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Gümbel Schäfer, the country government with " Rechtsverdreherei and sleight of hand " to their night flights.
A precise legal examination need their time.
The coalition did not want to operate on the basis of a " quick first impression. "
We need a legally Entscheiung, said Stefan Müller (FDP) .
So, as the opposition, are the statements of his group's ban on night flights.
US banks to pay back aid
The troubled US big banks strip their government shackles.

Quick election
It was then everything faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the ZDF board the editor - in - chief Nicholas Brender pushed out, the station had a successor.
Yesterday evening, the panel wanted to vote on the Personalie.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF capital studios in Berlin.
There was no confirmation from the station, however - officially, in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, also have played a role, the ZDF - Intendanten Markus Schächter should not further damage, this proposal to the board of directors.
Frey, Schächters candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 council members.
The outcome of the vote was not in print this edition.
Two weeks ago was Schächter with his proposal, the contract with Nicholas Brender to extend for a further five years, on the board.
Only seven members spoke for Brender, seven voted against him. Brenders defeat was a bitter defeat for Schächter, a erwartbare, however.
Because the Union majority on the board had already signaled weeks before the election, do not want to confirm in office.
Had organised the resistance against the editor - in - chief of the hessische Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument, Brender had lost the news of the ZDF in ratings, he rejected another term of the highly regarded chief journalist.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests, in which the political influence on the ZDF was castigated.
Finally, even 35 Staatsrechtler interfered in the debate, the action as unconstitutional.
Nothing came of it.
The person
Peter Frey was born in 1957 in Bingen on 4 August.
He studied politics, education and Romanistik.
After that, he worked in the South West radio and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey are scoring on ZDF, first on the " today journal. "
Subsequent stations: in 1988 to 1990 personal advisor of the chief journalist; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and moderator of " tomorrow "; by 2001, head of the foreign policy; since then, head of capital studios.
The Greens announced after the dismissal Brenders who was elected on Wednesday by the journal medium magazine for journalists of the year, a constitutional complaint.
Koch's adversary in the board of directors, the Rhineland pfälzische Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said in the past week, the countries should change the treaty so that staff proposals of the Intendanten cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
An excerpt of party leaders from the supervisory bodies of ZDF, however.
Brenders voraussichtlicher successor Peter Frey had recommended to the board of directors with a bold move - by the body immediately after the dismissal of Brender.
Thanks to this Belegs journalistic independence it was both Schächter without loss of face for the post of chief journalist nominate and elect the board, without the suspicion, a partisan office.
In the party arithmetic, the left - wing liberals.
Studies will entrümpelt
Partial success for the students: After a year of education strike drew the Culture Ministers of the countries on Thursday a: at a meeting of Ministers of Education and university rectors conference, both sides agreed to try to improve conditions in the Bachelor and master.
The students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the testing burden: in principle should each study only with a single test.
Moreover, the workload of the students and " a realistic and reasonable ".
Politics and universities also want the recognition of audit services between the universities inside and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to common structural targets for Bachelor and Masters more flexible.
Different countries regulations should not be beyond.
Less tests
Since the start of the student protests in June, Culture Minister and Uni rector the saying of the better Studierbarkeit in the mouth.
Now, for the first time, it was filled with a specific content.
The so - called accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of audits in part: " Each module includes usually with only one test, " it says in a 30 - page document, which is intended to regulate the authorisation of courses in part.
With the " significant reduction of the last review, " said the Accreditation Council chairman Reinhold Grimm, should be offered a " trend, the Studierbarkeit significantly disrupted. "
Moreover, the " Studierbarkeit " in the future, " the decisive criterion " in the design.
Modules as content are " strictly to examine " whether " unnecessary Einengungen of students in the choice of
Events " would be avoided.
The students ' right to maintain margins, the own initiative and promote ".
The rules should apply to the approval of new, but also in the review of existing studies.
This must all five years ' reakkreditiert " - which means that it will take until 2015, all the courses were reviewed.
Responsible for ten accreditation agencies, which are the accreditation, created by the countries.
The Culture Minister had urged the countries in October " with vigour " to the agencies that the material wealth is not too big and not too stringent verification regime.
In each, universities and colleges with the country's ministries have already agreed to take appropriate measures.
So far As the only country in Rhineland - Palatinate for the further development of the Bologna process additional funds.
The money should the universities, especially Tutorenprogramme set up and study advice and audit and strengthen.
Country and universities want to spend tens of millions of euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce an amendment of the university law to parliament.
This is the conclusion of a study model only one test.
The study design should be more flexible, the recognition of certificates to other universities and facilitate access to the master.
By the end of next year, all courses in the country on their Studierbarkeit should be reviewed.
The government and opposition had argued on Thursday again on the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The federal Bureau of Juso - university groups called for the organisation of education policy should not be held behind closed doors, " the minister and university chancellors.
After the latest educational strikes should now also the students " have a say. "
Support the future graduates from the President of the university rectors ' Conference (HRK) , Margaret winter coat: " We need the experience of the students, " she said on Thursday in a meeting with the ministers, with which the HRK on a common reform paper.
The union education and science (GEW) the Bonn agreement as a whole does not go far enough: it calls for a legal right, each graduates with a Bachelor close access to a secondary Masters course.
On the other hand, countries must ensure that for the current generation of students Bachelor tomorrow sufficiently Masters with the best possible conditions available, so GEW board member Andreas cellar.
The countries need to hire more teachers.
At a freer access to the master, the Culture Minister said not, however.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
In Germany and is the fine almost no control ... " is the first line of a poem that includes the Lyrikers Werner Söllner, in which this has lost troubling language snatches the arrival of dissidents, who won the freedom, but at the same time its language.
The 1951 born in Romanian Banat Werner Söllner had worked first as German and English teachers in Bucharest and later as in a children's book publishing, before he moved in 1982 after Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner is with various literary prizes, in 1993, the legendary Poetikvorlesungen at the Goethe University in Frankfurt, and since 2002, he is head of the forum in in Frankfurt.
For considerable außerliterarisches stir last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, German literature in Romania in the mirror and their Securitateakten. "
Visibly shaken and move Söllner read out a statement in which he rumäniendeutschen writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his cooperation as for the Romanian Securitate.
Together with some of those present had Söllner in 1989, the German language prize.
The recruitment attempts have begun creeping, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner, " anyone who is against intimidation of the Securitate are not enough. "
The lyricist Werner Söllner is Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize honours for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule the literary scene and, in particular, the Community of the German authors from shaken by a case of the abyss and the cowardice of a political system makes clear, which is based on monitoring and spying.
Werner Söllner is, so far as one can tell after previous knowledge, not only the perpetrators, but victims.
In his Securitate file IM Walter have played a role, said after the confession Söllners literature scholar Michael Markel and pointed to the positive influence of the Walter.
He had it in for him at the time sensitive points ", " Markel.
It is a moral need to make this comment.
Söllners statement was in the form and unexpected, before this audience, is the commitment of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service, however.
Germany has been a cosy reserve for Securitate agents, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time their own acts, 914 pages, read.
The people and in some case, what other name behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and even may have known clear Walter.
Unlike in the procedure safe sighting of the Stasi files dealing with the legacy of the Securitate monitoring still very vague.
A systematic education in recent years and has been hampered.
One of the Birthler agency National Council for processing the Securitate Archives (CNSAS) was in 1999, the publication of the files, but since then has been rather slow.
Only since 2005, there is a law that governs the management of the files.
That the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very high, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller an interview in which a former head of Temesvar dismissive about the prize.
They have a psychosis, finally did it only once.
The infamy of power said quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly the case Söllner, as so often the case in relation to publicize guilt, inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who was The measured response of the listening to Söllners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter of knowledge rather than will be determined by blame and shame.
The Genese of Herta Müller, who has received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Sättigungsbeilage Champions League
It was as if a smart gekleideter Außendienstler from a very nice Christmas party, at a sporting goods manufacturers had distributed Goodies, as the new VfB coach Christian Gross in the company of an orange plastic bag of a quarter of an hour after midnight in a herbeigerufene C class.
The man with the distinctive Glatze left him because of the chauffieren foreign city.
Otherwise, he would have been able to drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and besoffen before the 55 - year - old any more.
It was a pleasant evening, but the work is continuing.
Or just right.
In the words of the only three days earlier: " we have reached the eighth final ", namely in the Champions League thanks to the against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, " but we must not be blinded by the success: it is a brutally tough fight against the decline. "
The " much more important task " on Sunday.
Then, in Mainz the royal class performance in the league to repeat daily.
And once again revealed weaknesses in the rapid three gates by Marica (5) , Träsch (8) and (11) .
Lots
The eighth final of the Champions League (Hinspiele games/17 + 23/24 February/Rückspiele 9/10 +/17 March) on 18 December.
The joy of winning the commencement of the Babbel successor was up.
Not only the supposed cure, the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time, self - confidence, dedication and love of the game.
I have received on the players and told them that they should go back to their strengths, and have encouraged them to be brave souls plumber Gross, said that as simple - sounding recipe for success, under Therapeut Babbel but had had no effect.
He has a certain magic, Babbel supporters Jens Lehmann, " if a new impetus, sometimes things happen in football would not have thought possible. "
And Sami Khedira, after weeks of injury break thanks to its dynamic equal to the best players on the field, the " phenomenon " with the proverbial " fresh air " and the operation of the new superiors: " he is a man who and discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel had been lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet out of the woods, warns sport Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs but especially constancy.
As Gross players and managers the victory against a spare weakened and completely overwhelmed defenses of the Romanian guests.
They have also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 come, Khedira.
And sports executive Horst Heldt reminded that a season aim has been achieved, but it is still far off.
We are not yet on the mountain.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory for three months was due to the events of the weekend, in the form of a television interviews before the start of the game broadcast of gate - keepers Jens Lehmann fresh.
There are decisions that other and not the Jens, Heldt countered the harsh criticism.
The had accused the board of leadership shown weakness and change the coach to pressure pubertierender fans.
Also that his free day after games had been withdrawn, Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy.
Lehmanns statements were " characterised by pure selfishness, " keilte Heldt back and consequences for the final man.
They will probably not friends for life, the two forty.
After all, but they were with all other agree that without the preparatory work by the strong idea would not be have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants would have " a big share of the success, " said Heldt and Lehmann voices - and also the man with the plastic bag.

Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group chief Jürgen Trittin, Defense Minister Guttenberg because of false information to Kunduz affair as a liar.
The Social Democrats and Left demand information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following the recent findings on the air raid of Kunduz, the opposition Defence Minister Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception.
The minister said the deadly bombing of two fuel trucks in September " knowingly the falsehood, " said Green group chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the German ARD television news programme ".
It is called the landläufig: he lied.
The order to kill was in breach of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) .
This is the substance of the report, the NATO had read Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack not only a destruction of abducted vices, but also to kill two Taliban leaders.
In the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein requested US air raid, according to NATO report up to 142 people have been killed or injured.
The Greens, the Social Democrats and Left on Saturday called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) , immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government's policy, and whether German army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green Renate Künast.

He has not yet received a reply, it says.
The ministry said on Saturday not to the accusations and pointed out that in the Committee of Inquiry of the Bundestag, which will be formed next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some people see in wachem state images and hear voices, others do not see or hear.
Not only in mental health and drug binge blurs the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
As long as it is happening in their sleep, everything is in order.
If we with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we must likes the wildest ideas and Phantasiegebilden.
Anyone who witnessed in a guard traumartige conditions, things, others do not see or hear, see and hear in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addicts, at least as Sonderling.
But such images and voices arise not only in mental health or drug binge.
Blame our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or to write novels, sometimes to ensure that the boundaries between dream, fantasy and reality.
Traumartig changed awake awareness conditions can occur in many different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case of madness.
Although cause and effect may be different, the visions of the Mystikerin Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, schamanische Entrückungszustände, psychosis and similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the neural messenger substances of the brain - especially dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline, Acetylcholin - and the interaction of various parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and wahnhafte thoughts are very often during a schizophrenic climate.
The force of gravity has no power over him
The connection of madness and dream, philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of the dream in the state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, noted a " great similarity of mistaken one with a dream " for Sigmund Freud was the dream even " a climate of fear, with all the inconsistencies, Wahnbildungen, of such a ".
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. in a comic figure.
His body is two dimensional and quietschbunt.
The gravity has no power more about him, he is hanging in the bedroom ceiling.
He senses a kick.
Behind him saying vicious form with blood red, distorted Fratzen, zähnefletschend.
They chase him him with serious, inflammatory boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain of the whole body.
Noisy, malicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer tolerate it, the voices that attack and insult him.
Henning T. snaps two cable from the stereo, knotet a noose and fortified them in a hole in the ceiling.
He is rising on a loudspeaker and is tightening the noose around the neck.
Jumping.
The noose resolves itself.
This should be a lesson to you, the voices in trommelfellzerfetzendem chorus, " Walk in the clinic and let you cure! "
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has six acute psychosis, the last 2 years ago, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive - paranoid psychosis, moreover, he is bi - low, he takes medication to combat depression, mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
In the fears I have seen worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The images are cruel reality
About one percent of the population at least once in a life with schizophrenia, in psychiatric hospitals, it is the second most common illness after the depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychoses affected mostly can no longer distinguish between internal and external world, they are caught in a state to hallucinations, sizes, relationships or paranoia.
The vote is particularly widespread hearing voices, or comment on dialogisieren.
Optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person is not important to separate more trivial, the brain can no longer ausfiltern disturbing signals, the awareness is awash with impressions.
As the dream opens the psychosis the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies, the deeper awareness classes.
The reality of perception in the climate is subjektzentriert, says Professor Thomas fox, head doctor of the clinic for General psychiatry in the Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg.
The Schizophrene finds itself in the middle of it, everything has a significance to him.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he will, in the dream, overwhelmed by what has happened and
Schizophrenic often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality is not possible, the medical images are cruel reality, excluded awakening.
Once in a lifetime to have experienced a Halluzination
Unlike in the dream, says fox, " but the sinnliche and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in the psychosis, basically. "
The obsessive thoughts and hallucinations based in reality, the alienation of the Erlebens will take place in real terms.
Why is our brain antics, researchers still puzzle.
Exceptional conditions can lead to everyone that he loses the reality in the short - term, says fox.
But not everyone will develop a climate.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only determinants.
Researchers assume that involved minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronale maturation of the brain in an early stage of development, a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, for example, fox explained.
But it remains a mystery, as the disruption of the neural system, the manifestiere not also first over many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for psychosis, if the choice is there.
Also halluzinogene drugs can trigger psychosis, as they are in the central system.
If our brain is overheating
The nutcases, Psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs in order to get rid of them, others give money for drugs in order to get, says the Lübecker psychology professor Erich caste.
Whether fantasy as pleasant or unpleasant, is often just a matter of the position.
Box collects for ten years, reports of hallucinations and Trugerscheinungen, last year, he has his results in the book " The unreal world in our head.
Hallucinations are among the typical effects of psychosis, but also of astonishing many other diseases.
These include mental disorders, such as borderline or depression often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's skull and brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain circumstances, even the brain healthy people.
Hallucinations, so castes, from memory content, which would normally be withheld.
They arise when, in which are processed sensory initially or too little; if our brains hot or even if stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state as well as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also appeal of deprivation, stress, pain or other mental exceptional situations.
In recent studies, up to a third of the respondents to have experienced at least once in the life of a hallucinations.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg - Western Pomerania and visited the school.
A normal girl, really.
If it were not for the images and voices.
In the break, it can happen that a schlaksiger boy with long, dark hair.
If he says, look at the classmates surprisingly - no one else sees or hears these boys.
They think the timid girl for a day, but Sarah K. not dreaming, it knows it.
She is awake, she hears and sees these boys, just as the girls in the bank and alongside it.
You can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that they may be the boys.
Am I crazy? , asks them sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other fantasy is not real, and then disappear again.
At night, the most frightening phenomena
The images are often also a burden.
If you are sitting in the class room, they can follow the teaching material sometimes, because the teachers in their eyes and ears just unveils a new classmates, while for all other hearing and visible on the table mathematical equations.
At night are the phenomena most frightening.
If they are in their dark room to sleep, which is far too little and far too late, they can often not distinguish whether she is awake or dreams, whether the pictures you see, the Fratzen or the girl with the bleeding wounds arms and legs, before their open or closed eyes.
Let me in, they are the characters.
Parents and friends told them nothing, which would be crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
In the past year she has insisted the baccalaureate and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations.
Since the Internet contact with the psychologists caste, she knows that she is not stupid.
Cow is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or withdrawal is under appeal, he says, in all probability hallucinations, after a while.
I suspect that the brain is underemployed, and even for his entertainment.
Sarah K., a Einzelkind, had as a little girl, fear of other children, often played alone.
Their hallucinations began with 13, when they learned that the man they call dad, since they can think of, not their father.
As visual and acoustic hallucinations the same brain areas are active, the real impressions and sounds, it is affected as Sarah K. difficult to distinguish fantasy and reality. " Every experience, " says caste, " will take place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images of the brain, that is why they are so real. "
Even late - night dream images of caste as a form of hallucinations.
The hallucinations of healthy do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenia are mentally healthy in the situation, their images as unreal.
Caste advises his patients, therefore, the hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucinations
In our world too much bewusstseinszentrierten imaginary experience, unfortunately, says Michael Schmidt - Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy of Florence Nightingale hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also has positive, creative - is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt - Degenhard has researched the so - called oneiroide experience form, a special form of traumartig modified guard awareness.
Oneiroide are highly complex, detailed quasi - dreams, the Erlebende for real, and he cannot distinguish downstream from the.
The oneiroide consciousness state in trauma or illness in extreme situations, for example, in Polyradikulitis patients full awareness of a motor paralysis.
If a person is threatened by loss of self - and by, for example, by world, he replaced the life - threatening reality through their own imaginary world, the reality is, says Schmidt Degenhard.
A kind of border state between dream and hallucinations.
Since the deal with a situation in the reality is not possible, a world of change will take place, but the real situation in the imagination.
An intensive form of good Foundation and meaning in an intolerable situation, which allows people to design their own ability, not in a loss of loss.
Everything is real, later in the memory
The devoted art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his Oneiroid - experiences in his book " change of heart " as a bailout of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a heart valves operation, followed by a heart transplant on travel, while his body to the intensive care unit for Bewegungslosigkeit.
Claussen, a appears in a self - created world, other times and places: he is seen as bettlägerigen, old man, on board a Zugsanatoriums, a robot his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages of nobles who drugs from blood.
By a Greeks on the motorcycle in his own country, with his hospital bed in the Firnschnee the Alps and a Korean Mafioso.
He is completely in the imagined, everything is real, later in the memory.
These internal travel for Claussen differ radically from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental travel and even after years in the minor details.
More and more even than real memories.
The intensity of this experience goes beyond the horizon of our other secular life experience, says the psychiatrist Schmidt - Degenhard.
Ultimately, show Oneiroide psychoses, hallucinations and drugs binge, how fragile our internal figures of external reality in the guards.
Any change of status, say the psychologist caste, " can lead to a Verformung of what we call reality. "
An experience which may also be enriching.

The new publishing chief Kallen is an interim solution: in the long run will be Hubert Burda company in the hands of his two children, he said the mirror.
The holding company will also in future to 100 percent of the family.
Hamburg - the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit with 27 years and have the will to enter into the company, said the 69 - year - old the mirror.
The details we have as a precautionary measure.
The question of whether they are active in the company, then.
The question of whether they are in a position to do so.
You cannot vorsetzen 7 500 staff his children, if they are not sufficient.
This brings the children, and the company.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he is withdrawing from January by the board of directors, and Paul - Bernhard Kallen to his successor.
The 52 - year - old Kallen is a member of the board since 1999.

I am not as the political Präzeptor of this country, as it was, and I do not want to play the game in the world league with ' Time ', these shops are too great.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can read his e - mails, without a chance to be able to see certain annexes or to surf the Internet.
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame, as the magazine Time to one of the products of the year.
To see It is on the road, it is unlikely, but the idea is, nevertheless, especially for young people of interest.
In contrast to the Smartphones Peek costs very little and has a very favourable flat rate, for example, only half of the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success that it has two new devices on the market: one, that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, quite unlike the Peek, in which it must pay a six times higher.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same borders, as his American counterpart, however, has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, around 12 euros per month, roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone around the world, already know what it means to have to give up all the data in order to be able to read his e - mails, once you cross the border, or if you are desperately seeking a café with WIFI (or a link with Fon) .
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly tempting and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer specific contracts and prices for abroad, but in my experience, you need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to read all the fine print.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe remained almost always ignored.
Outside of their own country, has always afraid to read his e - mails and rightly so.
That a small device as FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name of Fon, although it has no Wifi/WLAN) this kind of tariffs, means that the telephone providers are slowly but surely to rethink and start to consider various ways of how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example, in its prices is the downloads of books and other questions on the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without snags.
It is an internetfähiges equipment and pay only once, at the time of purchase, and not every month.
And that is what I expect of a day of FonPeek a buying opportunity with lifelong Internet access as it offers the Peek already in the United States.
And that is not because I want to buy it.
I read my e - mails with the telephone, thank you.
But I expect this, because I believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to be able to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish colour of Michelle
Yellow is without doubt the favourite colour of the American First Lady.
The inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States appeared in a dress and a coat of paint and has the same colour re - elected him in his, without doubt, the second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has on two occasions very similar models, except that it was almost the same color - a bright yellow - green, the clothes from three parts - dress, jacket and coat from the same substance, and it was something she gesticktes or a neck chain.
It even goes so far as that at first sight, it seems that the First Lady of the United States, the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes but very much in the material from which they are made.
At the inauguration, she wore a dress from head and one from gemusterten office in Oslo.
The accessories were different: the first time green shoes with semi - high and the second time a änhliches model, but goldfarben.
Also, the hair every time was different: the hair were on this occasion as a hair wreath with the previous in the hair.
75% of working mothers have because of their maternity problems in the work
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who wish to have children.
This result is the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women " fertility and career women in Spain. "
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market because of their maternity.
The study is that there are major differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of work they perform.
Those of you who work outside the home, no other activity, only part - time work or have no fixed contract, is more likely to be mothers and have more children.
By contrast, postpone the women with a solid job, particularly in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
" The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a solid job get their first child on average only 3.7 years after the draw, a figure that rises to 4.1 years for women with jobs, which took longer to achieve this and and the first child until much later.
It also has the kind of work a great influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar in terms of preparedness, " explains the CSIC, Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor, the age of the women in the marriage and the first child to be taken into account.
According to the survey, the age at the time of the marriage and the first child the higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference was in the women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they are only the main education or higher education, on average, each with 25.1 or mother for the first time.
There is, depending on their level of education, another difference between the women.
While the women with Hauptschlussabschluss even before its first permanent employment and their first child, make it the women with a medium or high school exactly the other way around and find a permanent employment and marry later and then have their first child, Delgado.
Diane Kruger, it is also worth

The award of the British fashion industry

The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presented in " poker Asse " (Alfaguara, pictures of Fernando Vicente) to the thirty X - ray images of writers in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life) .
He used a predictable and furchteinflöβendes form (short biography, life and work) , but is looking for a Änhlichkeit the fervent heart of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent neither horrors still Erleuchtungen.
Except that this book is a köstlicher enjoyment of reading, it is also a moving invitation to read and keep reading.
Here are a few sequences from the book.
In addition to Albert Camus: " reading his pages, I found that the Mediterranean is no sea, but rather a spiritual, almost voluptuous driving, just as I have always felt, without words: the joy in contrast to the disastrous fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any God. "
On Samuel Beckett: " nihilist, allegorischer Christian, he wrote about what it is in the blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a poetic, without any sense of how the knife, which nearly killed him. "
Graham Greene: " Our man was of this woman with a passion which lasted for 13 years, so in its ranks, in whose meat the emotions on the grounds of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, united, a spiritual privilege, which was in the sky on the route of corruption. "
On James Joyce's " Ulysses " was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000er summit of world literature, you must climb the north wall, on the wall, to try again the best mountaineers. "

He said sometimes about himself that he would be the legacy of a boss of the county and other times, he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams of a certain GröΒe. "

Cowardly aggression
My 70 - year - old mother was last week by our city in the town of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years alongside her and our dog, our dog is a Mischling, we have taken from the animal and just six kilos, and then out of the blue lost him two Fußtritte and injured him so hard.
Our outrage is not in words, because it is incomprehensible to us, where the fun in a cheap aggression against a small and which is, of course, to the leash.
In addition to the attack, a woman who was walking she wanted to see these people as a result of the incident, they feared for their own lives, because if a Wahnsinniger attacked a dog, he will be the same, perhaps with a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman or probably even with each, the weaker than he is.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighbourhoods at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has geheult all day long.
Of course, we have in a nahgelegenen police complaint, however, we have great doubts as to whether it will bring and to prevent any prejudice from the outset, we would just make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation about what has happened has led us to this incident.
We cannot understand what must be in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a defenceless animal fun, an animal that we love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for road safety (Fesvial) a campaign to promote the helmet use, especially among the younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative is to draw attention to the importance of the helmet use, because it is ultimately the only protection element, the head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to the road safety, the " far more than just the design and manufacture of products, with every day more and more secure " and confirmed that they also help with other actions educational and informative nature to this objective every day to come a step closer.
This new campaign to promote the helmet use on the motorcycle, which, under the slogan ' to be or not to be ' is, in a first phase to distribute posters of 500 motorcycle workshops, in order to achieve the best possible spread.

The sale of small trucks is rising again in
After nearly two years of the car market for small trucks finally some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles, which were approved in November in Spain, an increase of 12.6% in the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase even after 22 consecutive months will decline, according to the manufacturers ' association and the car dealers ' association Ganvam figures.
These good numbers, however, are currently only with great caution, as the reference data used for comparison in November 2008, which was a particularly bad Verkausjahr with a drop of 60% on the previous year.
However, we must remember that, apart from the increase in the last month, the overall approval of these 11 months still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95.853 vehicles were sold in this number, but all vehicles, from which the vans market is: descendants of passenger cars, Pick - ups, vans, small vans and lighter chassis.
Furthermore, the same storm clouds in the sky, the most in demand, because even if some of the vehicles will be purchased by individuals, most of the sales to small and medium - sized enterprises, which almost 100% of all cases the purchase with a third - party financing.
So we have to these restrictions, which are the result of the supply to tap the credit institutions, there are other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this scenario, and unlike the cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the plan 2000E little.
This plan, however, is not only to individuals, the self - employed and small businesses have a right to expect that, if they are up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions, which 160 grams per want to buy, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday had Ganvam reminded that it is part of the state, including a special attention to this small and, of course, also on the industrial vehicles (trucks and buses) .
The car dealers association predicts a similar for the 2010 year just as the last, for which it with a sales (in passenger cars and SUVs) by 19%.
The support for Bremsmanövern in critical situations is now duty
As was the Antiblockierbremssystem ABS and how it is now happening with the ESP stability control systems, the aid must be a duty on the brakes in European cars.
In fact, they are already duty all newly registered passenger cars and light trucks, for the remaining vehicles was set by the end of February 2011.
The measure adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems, because of their operation can also help to prevent many front - rear collisions.
The task of the Notbremsassistenten is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking maneuver, which recognises the system on the basis of the drivers said brake on the
However, this system is not the pressure until the end.
According to one of the components manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the collision even more on the brake pedal and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The Bremshilfe with maximum force in the braking system and reduce the time and therefore also the Bremsabstand, a car in the Bremsvorgang back.
According to a study by the EU could each year up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians to damage, be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of Notbremsassistenten.
It would be even less accidents - it is estimated that every fourth accident involving personal injury could be prevented, as soon as the so - called intelligent system popularity.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that (on radar or a camera) obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time, there is a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver then responded, helps him the system to increase the pressure on the brake pedal, if it would be necessary.
If the driver does not react to the warning, and even if the collision was inevitable, the Bremsassistent the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as much as possible.
General Motors is the plan for Opel until January
While the workforce of the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, have been informed that the production of the new Meriva in the first week of April, probably on 8, according to Mr Ortega, the American car manufacturers to indicate that he needs more time to get the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wanted to ensure that the affected side their assent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, the first the workers and then the governments of the countries in which it works, will be put off until the beginning of 2010.
Dementgegen that it will take in the next few days a decision on the sale of Saab.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturers, so that this is a decision as soon as possible.
GM, with some potential new buyers in contact.
One of these buyers could be Geely, which also would like to buy Volvo, however, the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper - sports cars, which the Russian group Converg backing, more.
If it should come to an agreement with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to China's BAIC.
The decision to close at the end of the year, if it has not been sold, will also continue.
At the helm of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel engineers used the Boxster S as a base and made it really, to make it easier to 80 kilos, and he is now only
In order to create something, they believe, was the first to the automatic aufklappbare roof, which has been replaced by a Zeltleinwanddach so that alone has saved 21 kilograms, thanks to this model, as the GT3 " disappear " another 15; by the removal of the air conditioning again 13; it has also reduced the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, were saved another 7 kilo; through the installation of sporting Bacquet - seats again 12 and with the slight 19 customs Felgen five saved again.
Then we had still achieved through the renunciation of the audio system CDR - 30 again six kilos less and through the exchange of Türgriffe Griffe from substance by the lack of kilograms.
Although he is also available with the Doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK, the test was carried out in a car with 6 - established hand wheels, mainly on the smaller roads of California, on mountain routes, which were really very kurvig.
During his driving behaviour can give him only the note perfectly.
The reduction of its weight, but has not meant that he is no longer so sure would be on the streets.
Rather, the opposite is the case: we have long no longer such a small and easy model, which is a but also a feeling of great security in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, his muscles in a low gear in the required time to make warm until we give him the orders, to slow to recover and then back again everything from his engine to get out ...
He makes everything he says. The car makes everything we him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is just as communicative as precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine sound for all tastes
The Sound of his V6 Boxers with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and we can still raise it with the ' sport ' option and by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which was already in the Panamera for the first time.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginable brutality, whether from the foot or renewed acceleration.
The Federungen are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the roads, on which we have with the Boxster Spyder, was damaged, but the car meisterte the bumps.
The electronic assistants on the whole route had almost nothing to do; and that, although we in some of these curves ice at dawn and Rollsplitt this morning.
In summary, we can say that it is an ultra - light car, a car with an indescribable Fahrspass has, as it is rare, and it is much more than just a small improvement on the Boxster Ss.
The car will come on the market in February 2010 and cost 70.831 euro.

Eidson and Pnini contributed significantly to that the " Yellow " the helm (50-49) .
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but far from dead, had to prepare a few gambits with accuracy, in order to get back the air and one of them came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, with three successive almost three times and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that ads on the table again a reassuring was notified by the hosts at the end of the third quarter with (make.
The Alavesen exposed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) has already announced that they would allow them the victory in the first thirty minutes dreiβig away again.

Thank you!
After the glowing days since last spring, in which the inflation of assets was the prevailing mood in the markets, is back on the uncertainty in the markets, which is not surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the broker decisions on an inherently uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilize the markets, it was to pay off the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly the liquidity free rein in interest rates, the move to zero, so that in this way the assets to the banks.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets as well as ended and, without their heterodox policy to liquidity in question, start to throw a spanner in the works, as the BCE näc already with its annual auction, which takes place next week.
That is why investors have doubts about the ability of the world economy, the economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock markets and the differences in corporate bonuses rise again, even if they are still a long way from the para - normal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states have been forced to nationalize the private risks and the national debt will rise again.
It is now back on quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the favorite refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase of the differences of the countries in the euro zone in regard to Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard& Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards on the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, does not harm a degree of uncertainty for the defenders of the moral hazard had tried again, with the leaders of the world economic policy, an awareness of what had caused them to produce, since the devastating effects of the restriction of loans to the loss of jobs, had slowed down, as they should have adopted a new day thanks to action.
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai, a tribal war between the Emiren to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was also previously forecast.
A government which the public debt, elections and a new government, which is in the same direction.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year from the external payments saves and thus a euro member country no longer meet its obligations.
However, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and its citizens in need of auβergewöhnlicchen Maβnahmen with the duty to maintain the stability of the state money.
Yes, we are as expected from an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some Ausschweifungen to high amounts, it would now lie within the expected.
In the case of Spain, we need not worry, as long as the differences of the debt with the same speed as the European corporate bonuses.
However, the European differences and increase the Spanish, dannn would be a special Spanish risk.
The Standard& Poor's is a farce. forces during the early indicators of a large part of the market research institutes to their scenarios for the recovery and their scenario for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which, with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, despite all the warnings of a long life.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stock, although at the moment, " caution when driving ".
Associated industries
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, came as the first yesterday before the subcommittee of the House, where the strategy in relation to the energy supply of Spain in the next two decades.
After his appearance, the chairman of Gas Natural Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca followed Galán the press a few key points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind versschlossenen doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain 50 billion by 2020 Euround further 60 billion by 2030 from that date, under the promotion that the current nuclear power stations will continue to remain in operation.
Should this not be the case, the investment needed to $60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that it is no longer in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international groupings.
From 2020, the question will change and we should increase the performance.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal - fired plants with facilities to capture the carbon dioxide and, of course, especially on renewable energy.
In this case, he estimated that 18,000 MW more, under the will of course by other " Stützenergien
Galán, who is of the opinion that the Gesetentwurf for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, in line with what has called for his company, wanted to say anything against this law, such as incentives for the national coal consumption, the exact opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, " in the long term, it is clear in this direction, despite some " individual " measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola.
Be it as it may, that the decisions on the investment, even if these long term, because it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created in order to tackle them.
