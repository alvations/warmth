The interest rates have in Hongkong the same level only the U.S. 
According to the first minister Australian Kevin Rudd, the American legislators would quickly have to take back the negotiations and to adopt the proposal in order supports the financial system. 
Differently, one would risk what do others countries undergo the effects. 
The blood bath American action 
Monday, the American room the Rep. rejected the plan in order supports the financial system, which would she have had to devote to until at 700 billion of dollar( nearly 12 bilions of K). 
The legislators thus renounced the call for the supports the plan the presidents George Bush. 
According to Bush, the plan would have to solve the main causes of the financial crisis and to help to stabilise the whole economy. 
The American actions lived, Monday, a blood bath and the main indications of action knew the more big fall of these 20 last years. 
The indication Dow Jones lost nearly seven per cent, having known a fall of for the last time in 1987. 
The indication lost already for the vote, but when he appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in tailspin. 
The congress gave in: The government the USA can inject 700 billion of dollar into the banks 
The leaders the American congress and the government the presidents George Bush have put in agreement about a more wide form of the agreement of financial aid the financial American systems. 
It will be submissive the vote in beginning of next week. 
The American legislators carried out a decisive turning-point in the parleys on the adoption of a plan of rescue under the form of a financial aid of a amount of 700 billion of dollar( about 12 billion of crown), given the financial systems American. 
The success was not for all that sure. 
To be able to publish the final version of the law and to subject her to the vote, the Congressmans have to end a certain numbers of detail of the agreement. 
The plan of supports the financial system will be examined Monday at the room the Rep.. 
Says Sunday to the agency Reuters Barney Frank, the president the board of the financial regulation banking and of the room. 
The the sources, le mercredi at the earliest, the plan the plan would have a priori the plan to be submissive the vote the senate. 
According to the economists, the announcement the fact that the plan of rescue will be adopted would have to constitute a first psychological major factor in order to revive the financial markets. 
Yet, being data the complexity the mechanisms thanks to helps him the markets was able the complexity the mechanisms thanks to helps him the markets to be effective, will follow a" disillusion". 
Paulson: The plan must the plan be effective 
"We have achieved a big progress. 
We have settled our divergent opinions concerning the form which the packet of measure for the stabilization the markets would owe asset," the democrat Nancy Pelosi confided to the Agence Bloomberg. 
According to she, the vote would be able to be made from Sunday. 
In the night of Saturday at Sunday, the Rep. met the minister the finance American Henry Paulson, in order to give the governments a forms final. 
This one would have to buy back, the financial society, the unsaleable assets property who the financial enterprises take the the considerable loss and threatens the stability of the systems in his whole. 
"We were to put us in agreement about a plan who will and function who who must be, equally, effective on the market. 
Still necessary to pursue this plan of recovery the markets, but I think that we were there, it" says Paulson. 
A signal for the Asiatic exchanges 
The financial world-wide crisis has the considerable effects on the markets of action who are falling. 
According to the democratic Sen. number' were escaping Harry Reid, the legislators make of kind that the Congress results in a final agreement from Sunday. 
They thus wish to calm the investors before the beginning the exchanges on the financial Asiatic markets, who were situated in the first hourly area, where would the decision the congress be able to influence the exchange of Monday. 
Yet, as of now, it was impossible to point out with certainty the two rooms the American procèderont congress to the vote, neither if the negotiations do not risk to stay bloquées, the last times, per such or such problem. 
The legislators hope that it will be adopted during the days in order to come. 
Nevertheless, the law will still know many modifications. 
The total amount destined for the help the systems must be divided by in two parts. 
The first 350 billion of dollar, as the president George Bush wished for him, must 350 billion of dollar, as the president George Bush wished for him, be available the more early possible. 
But, if the congress will have the impression that the program did not fulfill his function, it has the possibility to jam the grant the remaining amounts, while following two stages: First 100 billion of additional dollar, then, in order to end, 350 billion of dollar. 
Mr Bush greeted the progress in the negotiations 
Although the president was able to put his véto on at this decision, the congress, him, has the possibility to put this one in minority. 
Despite these modifications, the main idea the program, who who consisted to elicit from the finance for the repurchase the bad titles property, which the value was falling, because the hundred of thousands of American not am in a position to to pay for their mortgages, been maintained. 
"All the work is made. 
The room the Rep. would have be in a position to to proceed Sunday to the vote of the law, and the senate Monday, "indicated the republican Sen. Judd Gregg. 
The eastern president American George Bush himself happy with the progress in the negotiations. 
His spokesman Tony Fratto declared that Mr Bush was happy with the progress made Saturday and ". 
Limitation the golden handshake 
The president the board banking the senate Christopher Dodd, negotiator in leader, says what the legislators have put in agreement about the responsibility for the financial program, the protection the contributing against the losses, the agreement of dégrèvements, the course the flat on the axis the time. 
The new law equally foresees to limit said golden handshake for the directors the society participant to the program and she institutes a board, who the surveillance the funds will provide. 
This last would have to be managed by the ministry the finance by. 
"We have worked very hard on the question and has made the important progresses towards an agreement who will walk and will be effective for the market and for all the Americans", has announced Paulson. 
The plan equally foresees an help for the owners property, who the problems to pay do have. 
The government would have to negotiate of new deposit in the case mortgage which she is going to buy back, while reducing the monthly instalments the debtor and while allowing these lasts to keep their houses. 
Marek: A psychological help 
According to the leader economist of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed eastern plan one good idea, but his realisation his realisation is going to be very difficult. 
"And that was due by the way what does one ignore what will be the mechanism and the price the repurchases the asset at problem. 
This point will be decisive in order to stand out on the dividing the loss between the financial sector and the government," iHNed.cz says Marek, this week, to the server. 
If the plan will be adopted now, else in beginning of week next, number'was, according to Marek, step if importing only that. 
"It was much more important than the congressmans put all right, from this week, that they support this plan and only they will devote the early possible. 
This psychological meaning of the agreement, foreseeing the adoption the flat, import the more at the moment," underlined Marek. 
An elaborate struggle in the extreme: The readers MP3 against the mobiles. 
One will recommend to you, comment to choose 
While basically all the mobiles know to read the files MP3, no reader MP3 knows to telephone. 
Seem it to result from him clearly that worth to better buy exclusively a telephone. 
N'prevents that it sufficiently exists of reason for providing an independent reader. 
The choice completely depends on the mode of use and the requirements the future owner. 
It would be absurd to buy for the house one dear gramophone haughtily of range in order to put the new album in Maxim Turbulenc. 
On the one hand, of such musical product are not taking out on record vinyl, and, from the viewpoint of the quality, he no objective reason, so that that happens. 
Yet, if it has there in your shelves the records vinyl piled up, the the art rock, the jazz or the blues, you at least likely dream of a such gramophone. 
It was likewise of the music for the displacements he to know of the music reduced in order to say him of way simplified-- of the music in MP3. 
There also, it was the categories the the price and of the quality. 
For one, he can he be unacceptable to spend eight crowns for a reader, of the same way only one fan the Pink Floyd would have the bought for twenty crowns for the markets. 
There two extremes, between which it was enough of place for everybody. 
The choice was wide. 
The life span battery was equally decisive 
Some readers of music high of range were capable of much more of thing that of a simple reading of music, but it was a matter there of unknown function, of course, of most the mobiles. 
No current device was as universal than the telephone. 
The first function, the telephone calls and the dispatch of text message, it was capable of reading of the music and the pictures to record these last, he owns a variable camera and can, for example, until to be useful for the navigation. 
And if one takes in count the Smartphones and the communicateurs, you will have in your pocket a small computer. 
Etant donné which no refrigerator knows to toast of the meat and what no television will take of photograph, we practically attend a miracle. 
Yet, the universal character the mobiles was not without disadvantage. 
More the number of function which you use was big, plus the interval between two rechargements will see cubbyhole. 
And the reading of the music was one the guzzler of energy the more important. 
Were rare the mobiles who were capable of reading of the music for ten to twelve hour, in most the cases, this figure was clearly inferior. 
In this respect, the readers of music( especially the more rudimentary) were clearly more effective. 
In the inexpensive case the mobiles, intend that they will play of the music only for some hours. 
If, in addition to, it is managing you to call from time to time, get, in order to be surs, second one to recharge for the work -- this being valid even for the more dear devices. 
Himself problem will not arise who for the readers MP3, of a continuous working of at least 9 hours, including the effective minuses. were capable, following a rechargement, 
An other problem is occurring at the time of the recording of the music in the mobile. 
Unfortunately, only a limited part the device has at disposal a connective universal USB, of autant more than not all can be directly connected at the computer, without a special software. 
One can, obviously, to record of the music directly on the card memory, but little of reader of card know to begin there without reduction, being data the minuscule dimensions the card used memory in the mobiles. 
With respect to the readers, you need, allowing for exceptions( iPod), of no software. 
It was sufficient to stuff, across the connective USB, the device of music coming from the computer. 
Are going the plupart the mobiles and the readers to create themselves a library media classified according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the style, ou alors according to the judgment of the user. 
Sure that others device were capable of the two( iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, the clever telephone with operating system) only an index one structure of tree, like the Explorer of Windows,. 
The readers were more easy to handle, the mobile have pleased of knowhow 
In the choice of a concrete device, you above all interest at the duration of life of the accumulator, at the ability of the memory, at the quality and the types of exit of his and, of course, at the easiness of the order. 
If the music was for you, in essence, a background-noise and if in the day are going you to listen to him only for a limited time, for example while taking the tram, it was sufficient any what mobile reading the MP3. 
Basically all the mobiles were today capable of him. 
You were even step bound to too make mindfulness the format music which the mobile or the reader was capable of reading. 
All are managing to read the MP3 and the big majority of the music who is going to reach until at you will have precisely this format. 
It belongs to the format the more widespread and apart from him, the big majority the device am managing to read equally of the music of format WMA. 
The AAC( format used), as for him, was less standard. 
The moving high of range equally allow, for example, the purchase of online music. 
It was sufficient to visit, since the mobile phone, the pages web of the operator( otherwise this of an other supplier) corresponding and to buy the song or the album in. 
This service at him lonely would have to constitute a convincing reason for providing a musical mobile. 
The miserable offer the eastern operators unfortunately and she restricts, in the plupart the cases, the the radio quickly made tube. 
The prices were not no longer the more low. 
Nevertheless, one considers generally only this way to buy of the music (only this either per GSM, internet, indeed by the internet without fil) will dominate the musical industry in the future. 
The plupart the people always carry their mobile on himself. 
At each time that you have desire to listen to something, you have to take out the pocket-size mobile, while you have forgotten your reader MP3 at the house. 
Yet, it was equally important if you always have on you the earpieces else one handsfree with connection. 
If this was not the case, you can use the integrated enclosures, which practically all the mobiles own, but a minimum of reader MP3. 
For many, the main advantage the musical mobiles was their price. 
The dear minuses normally cost fewer of three. 
For a price of three quatre thousand crowns, one can have a walkman already very suitable. 
Yet, in most the cases, you will be limited by the absence of exit for ordinary earpiece. 
The price the good telephones and the betters equipped, equipped equally with an entry for ordinary earpiece, does not outpace fifteen. 
The readers, on the other hand, have the advantage have an order easy. 
Really any who is managing to assure the order of the readers the more rudimentary-- who not correspond to inevitably the dear minus( cf. our choice). 
A minimum of function; And posts cassette, routinely used in the past, or of a gramophone, the resemblance of the order with this of a was obvious. 
It was not of risk of crash under the form of moving trendy one internet by chance, steady of one huge bill of transmission of data. 
What device to choose 
. The Vodafone 527) generally own a slot for card exchangeable memory( the type M2, microSD, and so of continuation). 
Even in taking in count the additional purchase of a such card, are going you to not outpace two crowns. 
But make attention. 
The models of basis as a rule support only the card with a maximal ability of 2 GB. 
Exclusively the more dear even struggle through the the card memory of 8 GB. 
If to own already a mobile and want still buy an inexpensive reader MP3, take one Cowon, one Creative, one Sony, one Samsung, one Emgeton, else one iriver. 
According to the ability( max. 2 GB), you must not spend more of 1 100 crown. 
If you belong to the more demanding listener, rather choose the specialized mobiles( Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices were equipped with command independent key for MP3, and this was thus that to the ease of the order approach of this of an independent reader MP3. 
Sony Ericsson, of the mobiles of the series walkman have the even tiny user. 
The same service, in the same category of price, but with an ability (until at 16 GB) and a life span (normally 15 hours, until at 35 hours) superior, eastern assured by a reader MP3 happened by one the mentioned mark plus top. 
A first potential operator will earn the Czech Republic this année-même. 
Perhaps 
The moving market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, our operators practically proposing the same services only their partners in Europe of the west. 
Despite, he all the same misses something -- a potential operator, who would force the classic operators to drop the prices. 
It can that he will not fail for a long time. 
We have already recalled, repeatedly, on Mobil.cz the fact that the Czech operators belong to the more dear in Europe. 
The TÚ( the Czech office the telecommunications), who has indicated that the price of a text message was more brought up at we only in the rest of the union, has moreover confirmed him. 
This was thus that, the last step of the Commission européenne in the domain of the regulation the due of roaming, a paradoxical situation risks to happen -- the text envoyés messages since the stranger will be for some customers the operators mobile Czech minus dear only the country. 
How how was this possible that the prices in the Czech Republic keep so high, in comparison with the Europe? 
The answer was simple, he misses one competition who would wish to really go in for the fight. 
That can that seem paradoxical, given that we all the same own three networks mobile and one penetration who widely outpaces the 100%. 
Au contraire, the operators moving like to complain that the Czech market am extremely compete. 
In this ák, Pavel Dvo, the president the council of the Czech office the telecommunications( TÚ), who has declared time and again that in the Czech Republic he more of place for a other operator, made chorus with the operator. 
It was likely true that one classic operator with his own network has apparently pleased much of chance( moreover, at present, he would only with difficulty find the frequencies). 
Yet, it still exists a possibility-- a potential operator. 
This was precisely the entry the potential operators on the moving market who a considerable fall the prices, in order has taken which had, afterwards, to react equally the classic operators. 
Yet, beforehand even the entry the trouble such than Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, the voices similar to this which one hears today at we let to agree in Great Britain. 
Yet, he has appeared that it remained of the place for of such operator and that they were able to have a real success. 
We were besides not bound to go to look for too many far in order to find the examples. 
The month of Feb we had informed you of the launchings, in Poland, of the operator potential Mobilking. 
In six months only, this operator has succeeded to earn more of 100 thousand customers and. 
Add only behind the Mobilking the fon group financial Penta, who the U own amongst others: in Tchèquie, ago. 
The advantage the potential operators being the possibility to concentrate on a target much more concrete group. 
So that their working was effective, they indeed need of many minus of customer only one classic operator. 
They were, indeed, exempt from the expense of building, of exploitation and of supports the moving network, relatively high. 
This was thus that in the world, the potential operators stand out like operator at fresh bottom -- they propose the the call and the text inexpensive message, this who of service are often counterbalanced by an offer by limited. 
Par exemple Tesco Mobile proposes, in Great Britain, the text messages at least two faiths less dear than his competitors. 
Yet, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, to betted on a target unusual group can equally constitute a good peal. 
Indeed, this operator aims of specific way at the men. 
"The true that man choose Mobilking -- an operator who pleases them and which they can do to confidence," said, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, exploiting this potential operator. 
It was difficult in order to say, if would be likely to walk also at we. 
epický Miroslav, of Vodafone, the spokesman doubts him: "The Czech market was relatively small for a segmentaire approach, on which the plupart the potential operators were based. 
The more so as it is relatively saturated with the viewpoints of the offer the services. " 
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say the operators moving 
Nevertheless seem almost sure that if it having there one operator potential in the Czech Republic, this will not be Mobilking. 
"We discuss of the expansion of this best-selling plan, but in the Czech Republic the negotiation were not very promoter. 
The launching of Mobilking will rather take place in others countries of our area," says in a supports ková telephone pro Mobil.cz Jana Studni, spokesman the group financial Penta. 
She has thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic support, at any rate, step favourable for this idea. 
Au contraire, they try to make all their possible so that one potential competitor was able to appear. 
The group GTS Novera, who would like so to cross one new step in order to become competing one real of Telefonika in the domain the customer undertaken, hides step, since enough long, his intention of throwing a moving potential operator. 
"We much keen be in a position to to propose at our customers not only the fixed services of telecommunications, but equally moving. 
And early the more will be the better. 
We have already led the negotiations concerning this possibility time and again with the moving set the operators Czech. 
With some, we has succeeded in advancing in the negotiations," said the spokesman the group Pavel Kaidl. 
Was thus perhaps promising. 
The the official information, it seems that we would be perhaps able to welcome the first potential operator already of here the end of the year. 
But as of now, his creation was accompanied by a total silence. 
"At the moment, we do not estimate that it was of the place on the Czech market for a potential operator as tel. 
The Czech market was in comparison with others very specific. 
Pour le moment, no subject equipped with a plan complex and serious in this domain has contacted us," has mentioned Vlastimil e Sr the department of press of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz. 
Others operators equally rely on the specificity the Czech markets. 
The spokesman of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová asserts in a rare agreement with the statement of O2: "We have step recorded as of now of viable plan and bilaterally profitable, who who would be able to serve of basis." 
And she adds: "It was practically outcast that a potential operator appears in the network T-Mobile of here the end of the year. 
In order to work in a periods of time also limited, we would have to have at disposal from now a concrete agreement. " 
Vodafone rather aims his attention at the fulfilment the request in order to get his own licence 3 g. 
epický Miroslav said at that: "We were open to the the negotiation the the potential potential operators, and above all in the domain the expense and infrastructure divided. 
This was this who, according to we, the viewpoint the customer means the more of contribution. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this domain placing a common network for moving fast one internet the discovery of a partner in order to put on. " 
The responsible authorities: In phase with the operators 
The approach the moving operators was easily comprehensible, the entry of an other operator would mean a rise of the competition, would have led to a decline in the prices and thus in order a decline in their profit. 
What's the use to facilitate the advent of a such competitor? 
When it was a matter of their interests, the operators know to agree like thief in fair. The quibble showing he equally the creation of the U: fon. 
The more big obvious pressure on the TÚ, at the time of the creation of the U: fon, has been this trained by the society T-Mobile. 
Show the information accessible the publics snapped out of the page web the TÚ. 
Yet, today, the U: fon lends to serve like argument in order to not accept a potential operator. 
Martina Kemrová has noticed in this regard: "The competition on the moving market has been accentuated by the entry on the market of a fourth moving operator, in addition, recently by. 
Considering the character the moving markets in RT, it was obvious that the additional entry of a player would subject him, and above all his service, the the high demand. " 
But being data the attitude the moving operators here, the indifference the Czech body of regulation seems disconcerting. 
It was yet not a matter exclusively of the attitude the TÚ, who, contrary to the Great Britain and at others developed countries, unfortunately not, in the Czech Republic, to be able to intervene in the economic competition. 
This one exclusively belongs to the office for the protection of the economic competition( ÚOHS). 
Yet, this last adopted, against this problem, his typical position. 
"The entry of a potential operator on the moving market would be possible following the conclusion of a agreement is entering a moving operator and the operator potential in concerning the renting of the necessary infrastructure. 
No agreement of this type no agreement of this type has been concluded for the moment, for offers him the potential person concerned number'has a priori not presented sufficiently of interest for the classic operators," no agreement of this type has specified en réponse our question Kristián Chalupa the department the foreign relations the ÚOHS. 
A statement not surprizes on behalf of Rep. the operators so. 
Who but of the part of an office, who must represent the interests the consumer and between the other to as take care, at this which nobody profits of his position on the market, a such statement was more than disconcerting. 
D'autant plus que Kristián Chalupa adds: "At the stranger, where were normally present, one can notice that their entry on the market has contributed to a decline in the prices the moving service telephone." 
Yet, to make pressure in the sense of an honest working the markets and of a decline in the price does apparently not make part the interest the ÚOHS. 
This who was actually shocking, this was the almost touching moving concord the three operator, who of their reaction follows. 
The question, if it was a matter there really of a chance, am all naturally arising. 
Of the same way, a price of the strictly identical gas at all the stations of was surement due the the chance and the hard fights of the competition. 
"The office has not banked, in this regard, of sign of a behavior anticompétitif, it does thus not have of reason for intervening somehow. 
None the operator have of position dominant, none has therefore a corresponding stepped-up responsibility for his behavior on the market. 
The tools necessary at the opening the moving markets the potential operators likely even fail the regulator the telecommunications," has specified in his statement Chaloupa. 
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market constitutes one the numerous points of discord. 
Of course, it exists an analysis the relevant markets elaborated, according to which the telecommunications form, from the viewpoint of the economic competition, one lonely market. 
None the Czech operator have of position dominant on a such market. 
However, some experts the right propose an other sight the thing: So that the creation of a potential operator was possible, necessary to elicit, at each time, the consent from the exploitant of network it. 
And the moving operator enough has logically the monopoly on his network. 
This was thus that he plays necessarily a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity. 
Yet, même sans to admit this argumentation, he would have to be at least worrying for the ÚOHS which three moving operators proceed visibly from a similar way. 
Yet, the plaints of numerous person concerned( including the society GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face, in the negotiations with all the operators, the analogous constraints. 
Am a enough standard turn in the communications to fall again the responsibility on the TÚ, the mean the ÚOHS hand washes whose hands of the matter. 
We have already met this type of attitude in several similar cases. 
One has unfortunately not succeeded make to go to the novélisation from of the law on the telecommunications, adopted recently, a widening the power the economic TÚ on the domain of the competition in the telecommunications, numerous specialist promised an improvement of the situation. 
That, the representatives the ÚOHS very well have to know him, but their interest apparently place somewhere else. 
When nobody looks, that can walk 
That said, the working of a is taking out of operator pseudo potential, several in the networks moving Czech unnoticed, rest. 
It was a matter of own list of price the moving service telephone, but these last were public only in part. 
In most the cases, it was matter of firm handling the multi-level marketings. 
The moving service telephone particularisés are thus proposed for example by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and bien of the other by. 
The lists of price of these firms are generally reaching only the the elected Rep.. 
The turn of magic consists in the fact that the enterprise makes in front of the operator classic figure of a customer undertaken, who who a big amount of card SIM orders. 
As important customer, she elicits the offers from price( and of other) special. 
This who is putting down problem, this was only the commercial conditions of all the operators mobile Czech ban a such resale. 
"If it happened this which you recall, would be able to be a matter of an infringement the contractual condition that we would and investigate who would be able to result in a stop of the collaboration with the society in question," has replied at our question relative to this problem Martina Kemrová. 
Nevertheless, was enough little likely that has not reached the the responsible for the operators mobile. 
In particular the three mentioned enterprises he can be a matter of thousands of customer. 
Auncun operator, yet, pronounces against a such procedure. 
En effet, the activities of these firms their are bringing the negligible profits, and, simultaneously, per opposition the potential operators real, they do not at all threaten with their own official marketing. 
Miroslav epický indicates the possible problems: "The law allows of such speculation, nevertheless, the service of these enterprise are used only by a negligible percentage of customer by. 
On top of that, this one were constrained to admit that the card SIM in their telephone is not recorded under their name, they can thus not arrange him fully, the ordinary customer the operators mobile. " 
Yet, this was that precisely who would have to seem strange the TÚ. 
Of more, am posing an other question the ÚOHS. 
Yes the operators moving ferment the eyes on a such procedure, why they jam the creation of a potential operator? 
Necessary to add that the ÚOHS arranges of relatively wide power in order to be able to unveil a such activity it, and if he will wish to not content the explanation the operator, who do claim to have no idea that that would happen, their contractual condition banning him. 
When will we be more the country the more dear 
As we have already recalled time and again, the entry of potential operator on the moving market has brought a considerable decline in the price the service. 
Yet, practically in all the countries where the potential operators appeared, the classic operators strived, sometimes pleased to prevent their creation 
The arguments practically support les mêmes by these lasts -- a too small market, indeed too saturé, the problems with the quality the service, etc. 
Yet, this was precisely at this level which the regulatory bodies have intervened, in the developed countries,, who did non pas defend the interests the operators mobile, but this of their customers. 
As well the the formal measure which by a pressure informal, they have ended up to elicit the creation from a first potential operator, followup by others. 
Unfortunately, the regulatory Czech bodies address this issue like a warm potato which one gets rid of in transmitting her to a close target. 
The experiences which we have, we can clear of the impression that the confusion in the competences was in these cases more than profitable. 
But do not throw away the handle after the banged. 
If the information of backstage say true that and a potential operator will appear soon at we, the moving Czech market will perhaps put back to movement. 
If one the operators has accepted the creation of a moving potential operator, the ÚOHS the ÚOHS will only with difficulty be able the ÚOHS to stay impassive the rejection( at the discrimination) others persons concerned. 
And we will perhaps stop to call more dearly than in the rest of the Europe. 
The new Czech hymn has four new upgrades. 
Choose the good 
Listen to the four realisation of the new Czech upgrade of the national anthem. 
Sunday, on the occasion of the day of the nationality Czech, the first minister Mirek Topolánek ceremoniously presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov j m( am my homeland?). 
The hymn has been again recorded by the orchestra the national theaters under supervision by í lohlávek B. 
We arrange of four versions -- with a chant solo masculine or feminine, an instrumental interpretation with choir and one version. 
The chant is provided by Kate ina Kn ínková and Adam Plachetka by. 
Otakar Jeremiá and ek Jaroslav Kr were the authors the arrangement of the hymn.

Indeed, they will buy their coupon by internet and one will record him on their card Opencard in one the thirteen stská knihovna m municipal( library). 
"In these points contact, it have there at the arrangement the passenger a counter with a personnel formed, who who will help the persons concerned with the purchase by internet and, in addition, will record the coupon which they have bought on their card," the spokesman the plan Martin Opatrný says.

The automatons are going to function from tomorrow, were easy to use. 
It was sufficient to introduce the card to puce Opencard and previously is going the coupon bought to check in himself on the card. 
The electronic coupons were valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but equally in the surroundings of the city. 
To know in the trains périurbains and the lines of bus 300 at 499, than use in essence the inhabitants the town of the bohemian plant in order to reach for the capital. 
The controllers" in the trains integrated at ská integrovaná doprava Pra integrated( transport of), the controllers are equipped of reader of card, they established the temporary zonal validity and the coupons;" the controllers have explained the test the tickets Filip Drápal of the organisation Ropid, who pragois conceives of the schedules the transport in common.

The Sudètes asked for a referendum the USA 
The German the Sudètes asked in 1945 this that umava is integrated the U.S. 
That follows from a registered letter in the collections of the eská v decká knihovna Jiho( the scientific library of the bohemian the south). 
If we can not belong to of the Germany otherwise of the Austria, we at least want to live under the patronat the U.S of America. 
In 1945, some groups of German the Sudètes supposedly appealed to the presidents the USA with a such desire. 
That follows between the other of an unspoiled letter in a archives devoid of, who knihovna is today deposited in in the collections of the eská v decká Jiho. 
The German of eský Krumlov beg in the letter the American president to not allow what upa rendue" umavská"( area of forest south of the bohemian)-- annexed by Hitler by virtue of the agreement-- either at the Czechoslovakia. 
"Have well understood the situation and we want we to be really sure only the words proclaiming that the American troops are coming to the German territory not not in hostile oppressor and, but in liberator," is written in the letter, signed" 
Considering only the rallying at the Czechoslovakia was supposedly promising-- in knowing the national Czech character-- only of brutality, of attitude without and of servitude, the authors of the letter beg the American president to choose in his hands the protectorate of the umava for now and for always. 
"We can hold belief, what you would grant this territory at a state foreign at we, and oppresses and en rien contributed at the victory the Alliés without to take in consideration the opinion the quarter of million the inhabitants," is written in the letter. 
The so-called reason for which the authors can not sign the letter was the fear of the desire of revenge the Czech" oppressors". 
If the president the USA doubted the opinion the German of umava, he would have to organise, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the area in order to determine if his inhabitants wanted to belong to the USA, else to live under the patronat the U.S. 
Good which the text restrained in the letter can, the current knowledge of the story of the postwar years, to seem somewhat unworldly, according to some survivors, he well illustrates the waits the German the Sudètes of the time. 
While the Czech German tout au moins had to make out only the matter of their expulsion of the republic will arise, very little among them if confessed a such possibility. 
Some waited that were going the U.S and the Great Britain to elicit for the Sudètes a certain type from autonomy. 
Others believed that they would quite simply stay in Czechoslovakia. 
The famous journalist Austrian Gustav Chalupa, born at jovice eské Bud, confirms him. 
For the war, this one been, as jovice German of eské Bud, committed in the navy in the countries Baltes. 
When in the end of the war, it was caught by the placed Englishmen and in the camp of catch of the area Holstein by, were coming the ten of German Czech to consult him so that he teaches them the Czech. 
"They believed that once back at them, would be profitable them", says Chalupa. 
None the German estimated, according to him, that, the decree Bene, he would be expelled from of the republic who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war. 
You do not reflect-- hushed up! 
An emotional country will attack the drivers 
The action aiming at the road safety the more costly in the Czech story. 
A way to characterize the emotional country media only at the intention of throwing, Wednesday, the ministry the transport. 
The office the ebí ek ministers Ale estimates that is going she to discourage the drivers of a dangerous behavior the steeringwheels. 
This country appearing at the television, at the radio, the cinema, on internet, but also the the leaflet. 150 million 
She would have to discourage the drivers from of the fast conduct and of the alcohol the steeringwheels. 
But also to remind them to take the belt before to start. 
She above all wants to touch the awareness the student drivers, the motorcyclists, the pedestrian, without to forget the professional drivers. 
This who will appear in the spots? 
Above all the personal stories are going to attack the emotions. 
Equally shows the slogan" girthing": 
You do not reflect-- hushed up! 
The sentence "you do not reflect" is written down in capital letter on the registration plate. 
Then, in a puddle of blood, the sentence ago" you will pay". 
This must symbolise only one can pay for of the life one moment of inattention. 
Are going" the spots to haunt" the spectators until in 2010. 
The ministry has drawn inspiration analogous country where in the Anglo-Saxon countries, can one show up commonly the picture the the drastic picture the victims the accidents. 
He estimates what what that will take a decline in the rate of accident and the numbers of death on the Czech roads. 
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG by. 
The strategy the sugars and the whip against the drivers 
"This who is walking with the drivers, this was the system the sugars and the whips. 
For them, the sugar are represented, for example, by the fact to save the time by, when they toast a red light. 
The whip, this was the threat of a fine or of an accident. 
The risks must be reminded the drivers, "said án, the psychologist the transport of the hospital Na Homolce. 
This was thus that needs us the countries of information in the press and above all the negative advertising it, estimate the psychologist. 
Were, according to him, already less effective. 
"When a static sign who puts on keeps him against a danger is installed, is likely quickly going he to merge with the environment and the drivers will notice more," reported Ko án. 
Olmert would give back in return the peace almost all the occupied territories 
Ehud Olmert, the president the temporary Israeli governments, pronounced for the return of practically all the occupied territories in 1967, including thus the West Bank, Jérusalem-Est and the heights the Golan, in return the peace with the Palestine and the Syria. 
It made this statement in a publiée interview Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth. 
"We who must result in an agreement with the Palestinians, this only he means will be necessary to give back almost all the territories( busy), indeed all," said Olmert the daily. 
"We will keep a certain percentage the territories, but we will have to give to the Palestinian an analogous percentage( the Israeli territory), since without that, the peace will not make," he added. 
He admitted that the possible return would consist of Jérusalem-Est. 
"In Jerusalem, and above all this who the security wants does not want only the tractors and the bulldozers crush the feet, as that has happened to one of my good friends, will have to give up the the part of Jerusalem," noticed Olmert in alluding the two attacks in the city, in Jul, several persons been killed. 
According to the first minister, it will be necessary to find" a solution special for the mount the temples, the sacred historical place and" situated inside the old city. 
"This who will want to maintain the Israeli sovereignty on all the city will be constrained to integrate 270 000 Arabs. 
That will not walk," he underlined afterwards. 
Reprocesses the heights the Golan 
Olmert equally pronounced for the retirement of Israel the heights the Golan, this who who an essential condition in the offing of the conclusion of an agreement of peace with the Syria forms, according to him,. 
Yet, that would equally require some efforts on behalf of Damascus. 
"I do not propose to conclude the peace with the Syria exclusively on the basis of a retirement the Golan," he indicated. 
"The Syrians very well know that are going they to have to give up in order to get the Golan. 
Are going they to have to give their current relations with the Iran up; Are going they to have to give their relation with the Hizbullah Shiite( movement) up; Are going they to have to give up the supports constant that they grant to the terrorism the Hamas Shiite( movement), of the Al-Kaïda terrorist( network), just as of this the jihad holy( war) in Iraq," specified the first minister. 
Question who are arising after the accident: Be in the bus the stewards illegal? 
The law ignores them; To walk in a for long-distance distance was forbidden 
In the context of the tragic accident of the coach of the society Student Agency of Padoue, in Italy, nearly was arising the question if the stewards and the passengers can during the ride to move inside the coach. 
"If one wanted to respect the law of way strict and formal, the activity of an eastern steward against the laws at the law on the road traffic," said. 
The accident in 
Sat by then unfortunately seated the chauffeur, on the seat the more dangerous the vehicle, although it has at his arrangement two other seat. 
Yet, the coach can have an accident, indeed to slow down of abrupt way, also when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers. 
This who import, this am if the coach was by virtue of his card technical equipped standing or nay place. 
Yes this equipment for place number'standing was not authorized, the passengers must remain seated. 
The coaches long-distance distance Student Agency do not arrange of place standing; This who of the ura enterprise Radim Jan has been confirmed to by the director by. 
"This was a question which we have addressed with the ministry and, in the beginning, he banned all displacement the passenger. 
Then they have canceled him and we has gotten that the passengers can go to the lavatories during the ride provided that they have their own seat," he has unveiled his position. 
The law ignores the steward 
"It does not exist of legal one-to-one interpretation the role of steward-- no legal prescription handles this role. 
On the other hand, no legal prescription does not forbid no longer the carrier to propose the services. 
The law on the transports road exclusively knows the term of recipient of vehicle; She does not define his rights and his duties, "adds with more of ambigüité the spokesman Hanzelka. 
Josef Pokorný, the vehicles, the department head estimates, the opposite, that the law sufficiently treats the problem. 
"All depends on the fact if the coach has in his approval the permission to propose the places standing. 
All resides inside, "he said. 
The coaches are divided by in urban, where was it the place standing and a maximum limited speed, interurban the the place an authorized more high long speed and in coach standing and outdistances without place standing with the maximum authorized speed the more high and the seat fitted with safetybelt. 
As in the airplane, says expert one 
ín Jaroslav Ho, expert at BESIP( security of the road traffic) in in the transports, security sees step the displacement the steward aboard like a major problem. 
"At the time of a regular circulation, it was not of danger. The situation can be compared to at this the service in the airplanes. 
There it no longer, was not sure when a turbulence will happen and the flight attendant can knock the head. " 
"Gold, in the case where the coach would have slowed down of abrupt way, would be obviously valid. 
Of the same way what in an urban bus or in a tram. 
The carrier must manage the security the steward the the internal prescription," he says and he. 
ura eastern Jan ready to delete these services 
Student Agency was the lonely carrier coach to propose the services of steward. 
He hires two hundred he. 
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their job like a job at risk. 
"Nevertheless, as soon as I will have the impression that it was a matter of a job at risk, I will delete him. 
The passengers can receive their coffee and their newspaper at the boarding. 
That would equally reduce the expenses, "he said. 
The worry of security was the reason which the director of the Asiana Alexeï Litvine gives at the absence of steward in his vehicles, who does provide, in comparison with his, a very limited number of line. 
"We do not have of hostess. We oppose there all along. 
Sooner or later that will end by a mortal accident," he has said, it has there a year, at Týden.cz. 
An huge tragedy has arrived 
An young hostess of the area of Plze, who worked for the society since two years, has perished at the time of the accident on the line of Naples. 
A slovène truck have likely quité the shoulder and he has jammed the way at the coach. 
The chauffeur of this last to try to avoid him by means of a manoeuvre rushes, but he has brushed by his side against right. 
Jan ura refuses that the two reserved seats the rest the steward have been sold. 
"Dans le cas the line long outdistances, it was not possible to book these seats, they are jammed." 
The enterprise intends to lodge complaint against the driver the truck. 
For the compensation of the family of the girl, the agency number'will not expect the judgment from the courts, but with respect to the financial compensation, she also counts on the culprit. 
A modification of the law? 
Step in the offing 
A modification of the law, am in the process of to be elaborated, since more of a year, by a group of thirty experts the ministry the transport, would be able to bring the precision the displacement the steward aboard to the coach. 
"Yet, she has not resulted in an indifferent conclusion on this point. 
As a matter of fact, she does not interest the too the bus, but rather the systems of point, at the maximum speed on the freeway and at the use the mobile phones the steeringwheels," the ín expert Ho says. 
"The ministry the transport does not consider the activity the steward like a thing who the security the passenger would fundamentally start," the spokesman Hanzelka concludes, in specifying what of the eastern security the coach under the power of the police and of the office for the security the works controls him. 
The hopes the Düsseldorfois rest on Frankfurt. 
The big words did not fail in the letter sent of the WestLB the employee of the house. 
In an union the entities of the financial institute of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt," the central institution the financial markets the financial group of the Sparkasse "would be able to constitute, according to the rendu public mail Monday. 
The WestLB would be bringing a" block of competence" lined with a lasting productivity to a such matter. 
somme toute, a such relation would be able to be the decisive kickoff towards others concentrations in the sector the banks the Länder. 
Veiled at what that does look when a board board of director keen to demonstrate his ability of action the the difficult times. 
For the WestLB, injured, always underwent a strong pressure. 
This was not only the Commission européenne, but also the federal authority of Surveillance the service Financiers, that only recently, clearly make to consist of the governments the Land of Rhenanie the Nord-Westfalie which the time was counted in the research of a future solution. 
It was however question since some times already-- as near Frankfurt-- of a relation of an indifferent form between the bank Deka, who connait the customers of the Sparkasse of by their investment funds, and the WestLB. 
Indeed the leader of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas has made to know at the time of the presentation the figure the semesters end Aug which which it showed up no sense in the fusion of the house of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, only this either the Helaba or the WestLB. 
However the board of director, whose each eastern half supported and Länder and by the groupings of box of saving, chargé the management committee to drive the parleys with the WestLB in order activity commercial town. 
Would be able then to be a matter the output the markets, otherwise of part of this one. 
The parleys however has just only to start, one says in the financial centre. 
This number'who, with his 3000 employees, was not the first time that the Deta-Bank, counts for one the more important employer on the financial centre of Frankfurt, am going in for stake it was matter of consolidation the sectors the boxes of saving. 
In 2003 one has believed hanging a time which the Deta-Bank would be able to merge with the bank the Land of Rhineland Palatinat and the Halbab. 
Nothing is yet brought out again of this ternary bunch. 
Hardly the plans had they made public what the government the Land of Hesse did pronounce against all participation of the Hellaba in this one. 
Par la suite, the two other houses no plus ne himself rejoignèrent step. 
The bank the Land of Rhineland Palatinat has been attached to at the place at the bank the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart. 
But he there always of new bargaining on the grouping of the Deka-Bank the the banks of Länder. 
In last place, Günther Merl, president the management committee, if was however pronounced against all commercial strategy of fusion with his bank by. 
Independently of, seem the feeling to spread what the public grouping the various establishment the sectors was particularly urgent. 
Now the election the parliament the Land of Bavaria was past, one union the BayernLB with the bank the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg would be able to materialise all told first. 
For the Helaba, this was not particularly a new maid. 
If the pressure who forces at of new fusion had to increase, the possible partners are escaping him little by little. 
In the south, it would be henceforward a partner junior, although she has by then better stood up to the crisis only the banks of Munich and Stuttgart. 
The grouping the savingsbank and transfer of Hesse-Thuringe, who own 85 per cent the capital of the Helaba, on the other hand pulled a bolt the beginnings of the year on all union with the WestLB. 
Would if need be remain the NordLB. 
Of such reflection géo-stratégiques however reflects only a the facet. 
An other facet is putting down the matter of knowledge what way the various commercial models of everybody of these banks can match of. 
In Jun, Merl declared that the decisive question, to know thanks to commercial model the future ability the banks the Länder would have assured, number' not by then determined by the German grouping the box of saving and transfer. 
To the end, a carving up of the WestLb would be able to take place, carving up who here for number'am obviously not wished. 
This was also of that whose it was question in the letter the board board of director: All told of cause, statehood would be aim one solution overall'for the establishment. 
What way of will this be put in in the same all with the union of some entities with the Deta-Bank still remains to see.

Night of insomnia for the shareholders of Hypo Real Estate 
The banking German system was relatively stable, pressed ahead the federal minister the finance some ago week only. 
What chance which the politician used was the word relatively'and only he slipping only the sector German banker would be step saved. 
This one has indeed occurred this weekend. 
The financier of the realestate business Bavarian Hypo Real Estate( HRE), the DAX, side elicits from a consortium of German bank a credit of a billion in order to protect the turbulence the markets. 
A person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters Monday that the credits of help are released until at an amount of 35 billion of euro. 
The Hypo Real Estate would have henceforward to pay the interests on the fraction to the she thus straight. 
The money is coming as much from bank private only of bank of public right. 
In background, this was the society Depfa who supports the losses. 
The financier of statehood had, according to an article of newspaper, refinanced at very court term the the long-term plan for which he had borrowed of 
The first semesters 2008, the reserve of liquid assets of the bank had been cut back back of 95 per cent at 2,37 million of euro, the rate also of own capital had light weakened of 1,6 at 1,45 per cent. 
The profits in the process of and this net coming from financial transaction were, with respect to the same period the previous year, fallen up to scratch zero, the profits coming from the valuable awarding of debt and thus only the cancellation of stock in the operations of credit had fallen of more of 70 per cent at 5 million of euro. 
And this was only the important profit snapped out of the repayment the costs of accounting downstream coming from the restructuring of the former group Depfa, thus only the repayment the interest according to the book the fiscal procedures and the commercial purchase for the enterprises of Konzern which the deficit the wage of about 16 per cent has turned out the deficit the wage of about 16 per cent to be moderate. 
After his privatisation in 1990, the financial elder of state had all first badly speculated the the industrial credit property, who then had been filialisés at the bank Aareal. 
Parce ce which the classic financing of statehood was not enough profitable, the Depfa then committed no longer intensely in the plans in order infrastructure and in the financing of plan in common investor deprived (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally. 
On the value of the society, the Hypo Real Estate must proceed to the the amortisations who would have on the calculation the wage and the losses the group one material essential effect who enough vagueness all the same stays. 
The fact was that the dividends have been amputated. 
Already for 2007, they had been truncated the two thirds. 
The Hypo Real Estate was, since the repurchase of the Depfa, an highly important investor of statehood and of infrastructure. 
It was more solid than others institutes dependent on the refinancement on the market banking since she owns no store of customer. 
With the bankruptcy of the investment bank week, the awarding of if is again considerably dried, the banks having accumulated their liquidity. 
The Hypo Real Estate needs yearly for a part-- about 50 billion of euro-- of the set the credit of the Depfa of a short-term mean of refinancement. 
According to a communiqué of the Hypo Real Estate, the need for financing the eastern overcast group with the credit at medium term and the enterprise protected of the influence the international financial markets widely out of state of walk currently. 
Others sources say that would be assured the bottoms until at end 2009. 
The president the board board of director of HRE Georg Funke on the other hand explained what what the group Hypo Real Estate would have to more have to resort to the financial markets at mean term. 
The federal bank and the federal establishment for the surveillance the service Financiers( Bafin) are leaving from the principle which the ability the group Hypo Real on the market was from now on assured. 
The shareholders and the creditors of the bank more than to hope for him. 
However, in the light of the dynamics and of the impondérabilité of the crisis, it exists. 
This was moreover not unthinkable that necessary to not resort to the financing in all his extent it. 
But the opposite no longer can the opposite be remote. 
After the fact that the bank was, according to the last communiqués, still the doors of the insolvency Sunday in end of evening, this rescue in order the less temporary will not succeed in reassuring the mind no longer. 
The share price has collapsed of 75 per cent at 3,30 euros. 
The yards the obligation, on the other hand, particularly well concern. 
While the debts the first leader have hardly moved, the ready courses the of minor plan bend. 
The more touchés were above all the investment funds society Württemberg Hypo and this agreed good one life span. 
Who seemed previously the obligations of the bank Hypo Real Estate to be an alternative investment of speculation, henceforward their value must be considered like dependent on the stability the systems international banker after the net made hardening of the crisis banking and of the crisis of the institute even to enter the crisis in the establishment by the repurchase of the bank Depfa. 
While the institutes of emission, the governments and the commercial less touchées banks were ready, one can assume a reduction the arrérages in the times. 
Ou bien will arrive this which nobody dare to hope for at the moment-- only the financial crisis was able to be surmounted in the 15 next months. 
But the renouvellés noises of a partial nationalization, the probability who the eastern sureté today grown one simple well-founded hope was approaching. 
That would have to reserve the nights of insomnia for above all the creditor long-term on the decision to know if they must part with their commitments. 
The investors in the short run can always use this on what they have snapped out a feature in order to constitute a postponement of the loss for the next years on the next tax on the incomes the capital the boursiers wage automatically taken.

Already the way in order to go into the school did to me fear. 
I live in outskirt of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes until at the Highschool of Tachibana. 
I have the trouver the way all lonely, fortunately I have not gotten lost. 
The beginning the seem course to be not fixed of way as strict than at we in Basse-Saxe. 
The pupils appear one after the others to leave of eight hour, until at nine hour less twenty, a turn of table takes up with the professor, the room" home". 
But before the course starts, this was at me of to present me. 
I was not at all the kind to like to speak ahead the people, particularly in front of a class of 40 pupils. 
As I did not have still the uniform of the school, I have dressed an old skirt of my mother of welcome, as well as a shirt, the upward blue socks and the black shoes in. 
In this dress thus, I have turned up in front of the desk, and has tried to all pronounce properly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' -- I call Sylvana, I am coming from Germany and my birthday was in a week. 
At that time, I was very happy to have begun to learn the language he there good two years. 
The 31 daughters of the class have all made the low mass, pouffé of laugh and fact the signs, and I has constantly heard the word" Kawaii". 
I knew him already thanks to my mangas. 
It belongs to the vocabularies essential at the survival the Japanese teenager and means" sweet, cute". 
Then I have quickly squeezed at my place. 
The girl next to me has done to me a big ironic smile, she found that this was an honor that the correspondent has to sit down at her. 
The rest of the hour has been enough quiet, but when the gong has resonated, I have been attacked in the periods. 
Everybody spoke better off better, pouffait and of laugh was laying many of question-- in this case, this was enough difficult to consist of the English Japanese. 
For the break, they have all then taken their Bento out. 
My mother of welcome had also made this kind Lunchbox -- this was really other thing that the miserable German snacks. 
I had the rice the aromatic grasses, the small sausages, one salad of cucumber and of seaweed, the fruits and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu. 
Most of the time, I have no idea of this that I exactly eat here the Japan. 
The things have a bizarre appearance and a completely new taste. 
This who was sure, this was that everything was really good. 
Voucher, except perhaps the salty candied plums, brrrr! 
The Bentos were not only the lunches in the Japanese schools. 
It is sometimes happening that a girl offers to a boy one Bento which she has prepared herself, and who is then prepared particularly carefully-- dans l'espoir de to be able to meet a little better. 
I have read that in my mangas. 
I was curious to know if I would be able to watch him as here. 
"Why the Japan in particular?" have asked my friends when I have told them that I wanted to go an year from the school to Tokyo. 
I have then always replied: 
"Because that fascinates, what" 
In end of count, to read the mangas, this was this which I prefer already the the years. 
And in order to better consist of the mangas and the culture who finds, at for a while, I have also begun to learn the Japanese. 
For me, this was really clear that I had to travel there one day. 
Because I also have a weak for the traditions, the us and the customs. 
And here, one gives them many of importance. 
Of, the Japan was the country the technology and the proneness the more recent-- of, it was severe, disciplined and usual. 
And as all is so well organised, I have never felt lost here, even if Tokyo was the more big city which I have never seen. " 
Also the rats have the sensations 
A rat or a cockroach was fleeing ahead the danger, est-ce-que that wants to say what he also feels of the fear? 
The neurophysicien Joseph LeDoux was convinced he: Many of animal also have the sensations. 
But how would be able to verify that he feels the same thing when it behaves of the same way? 
In the online magazine" Edge", the contributions are published for years by of famous scientist by. 
Do SPIEGEL ONLINE present in a series of article the answers to the question" which you think true being without to be able to have the evidence?" 
I believe that the animals have the the sensation and of other state of awareness without only me or anyone else number' up to now be able to prove him just like one can to not prove what do the other humanbeings have an awareness. 
But in this case, one can at least hope only all the human brains present the same configuration. 
As soon as we are turning towards others specie and we reach the matters of the felt otherwise generally of the awareness, we are entering the the with difficulty practicable ground because the hardware does not correspond. 
When a rat am in front of a danger, it makes the same thing other animal: It makes the dead, was fleeing or attacks. 
The humanbeings behave of the same way, therefore some scientists deduce from him a subjective comparable experience. 
However, I do not hold belief. 
Two aspects of the structure the brains make the transposition of our subjective experience at this the animal difficult. 
A the aspect was only the tours associate almost always at the human awareness include the lateral préfrontal cortex( because of his participation in the short-term memory and in the functions of direction and of execution). 
This large area was much more developed at the humanbeings only at the other primates and this large area seems to be completely absent at others beings. 
Human whole the less thus for these aspects of our awareness who depend among which the préfrontal Cortex, the awareness of who we were, and the ability to foresee and to decide, he was sensible to suppose that even differs from the other primate. 
An other significant particularity would be able to reside in the linguistic nature of the man: A big part of his existence being connected to the language, that often means that his awareness depends on him. 
In this case, one would be able to exclude the animals. 
But even if the awareness not had to depend on the language, this one would influence him safely, so that the animal awareness, no matter what the way of she is produced, would probably differ much from most of our states of awareness. 
This was for that it was as difficult to determine can to look the awareness at others animals. 
If that, internal and subjective, lets neither to sise neither, the made of this hardware particular, to analyse in being based on our own experience, then his observation is posing to us of big problem. 
The plupart of my developments make reference to the content the aware experiences, but it exists next door an other aspect of the awareness who would have to be more easily accessible scientifically. 
One would be able to examine the processes of awareness the animal irrespective of their content, and this was exactly this who if was past at the time of study on the memory at short term the primate, particularly with the example of the visualisation. 
But in this approach which have followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one is concentrating more on the nervous correlations of the awareness only on the causals mechanisms: Both can both be identical or not. 
Curiously, this approach also underlines the weight the préfrontal cortices in the realisation of the visualisation. 
What but does he result from him then in order the emotions? 
I gather from him that an emotional system such than this of the fear is activated in a brain aware of his own activity. 
This which we designate like" fear" was thus the mental state in which we find when the activity the defense mechanisms located in the brain (otherwise his continuations, like the reactions the corps) monopolises of the lively memory. 
So closely connected to the area the cortices who characterize the primates and all particularly the man, the emotions were closely connected to the area the cortices who characterize the primates and all particularly the man. 
Of subtle degree the clears, associate at our voluble nature,, because we can, with the help the words and of the grammar, to differentiate and to categorise the states in order to attribute to of the other only in order us even. 
At the opposite, for example Antonio Damasio thinks that the sensations being born in the areas of the corporal sensation the cortices and the cerebral trunk of primitive activity, just like Jaak Pankseep who is however concentrating more on the cerebral trunk. 
Like this network has not much modified during the human evolution, would be quite able partaken of transversal sensation in all kind. 
Of a purely theoretical viewpoint, I can not contradict him, but I believe that indémontrable. 
Pankseep claims because of only this who represent like fear at the men and at the rats east probably as felt like tel in the two cases: How would be yet able to verify if the rats and the men feel the same thing when they behave of similar way? 
A cockroach was fleeing ahead the danger but, if he feels of the fear? 
At my eyes, the similar behavior were not sufficient to prove the experiences identical. 
Indeed, the nervous comparison helps: The rats and the men own the cerebral similar trunks, the cockroaches on the other hand own pas même one brain. 
But est-ce-que the cerebral trunk was originally the sensations? 
And even if one was able to prove that for the man: How would be able to demonstrate him at the rats? 
I believe that the rat and other mammal, perhaps even the cockroaches( qui sait?) have the sensations. 
But would not know how to demonstrate him. 
And because their sensations probably differ completely from the ours( since the human awareness relies the the special tours and on the language), I prefers to explore the emotional behavior only the emotional sensations the rats. 
In all the cases, the poignent progress on the nervous plan in the measure where one gauges the same thing at the rat and at the man. 
As I do not explore the language and the awareness at the rats, neither the sensation, I do not know if they exist. 
One would be able to judge that the the short-term, but I prefer to advance to knock me constantly against a wall. 
I am indeed following a pragmatic émotionel. 
Platini, president of the UEFA: A grace period and the Ukraine 
The first Ministre auxiliary Iwan Wasjunik has explained what the preparations would be soon put in under the direct responsibility for the presidents and the first minister. 
"The government considers the decision of the UEFA in Bordeaux like a proof of confidence in the Ukraine and in his ability to organise, in collaboration with the Poland, the championships", announced Wasjunik. 
"But this was not an amnesty for our country. 
The work exactly has just to start, and it has there still many to make in both country. " 
In the calendar of the building or of the destruction the stages, the streets, the hotels and the airports, the two hosts are running afterwards the deadlines. 
The number of stage in order the championship would be possibly able be reduces of eight to six. 
"We can more lose of time. 
We must work for the maximum speed", announced the president of the Ukrainian league Grigorij Surkis. 
"The UEFA has us constantly at the eye". 
On a still more radical measure has been decided in Poland. 
The direction of the league of football Polish PZPN has been hung on the board Olympique National after of numerous scandal and substituted for Robert Zawlocki, administrator independent. by 
The commission had gathered on the demand for the ministers the Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
It would exist" a true danger that the PZPN was not capable of acting in the periods", announced Drzewiecki of the pressagency Polish PAP. 
"We have assured in a mail the presidents of the UEFA that the preparations the European championship of 2012 would not suffer." 
Several members of the league of first division been, already in the previous season, convict for handling of compulsory relegation; In the end, the beginning of the league have same the quirky being at the last minute. 
Indignant Dennis Quaid counter attack 
She wanted to make the promotion in order a new picture, has spoken of his private life in an interview -- and has now the troubles with his ex: The star hollywoodienne Meg Ryan has raised the veil on sound ex adultérin Dennis Quaid. 
He foams-- and counter attack. 
A pink late war the for the ex couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two hollywoodiens actors deliver an inelegant battle-- au vu et au su everybody. 
Last week, Meg Ryan had expressed in an interview for the newspaper American InStyle on the causes of the failure the marriage: "Dennis has been for a long time unfaithful, and this was very painful." 
She would have taken knowledge of the extent of the deception only after the divorce. 
The motive of this striptease of the thought resides in the relations of press of Ryan for his new picture" The Women" -- is there told the story of an adultery. 
The reaction of Dennis Quaid on his qualification of unfaithful husband was clearly falling: This would be" monstrous", said this one to the "N.Y Daily News", 54 years, Meg once again ruminates the story of our relation and". 
This would be of more" deplorable", only" the trouble and the disruptions which which comprize a divorce for each child again revived in public "for their common son of 16 years Jack." 
Saw lonely since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will become soon the father of twin. 
So was his answer to the peals of claw: "At any rate, my life continues. 
I hold happy a wonderful family is at best going". 
The prices and the hotels are falling 
In the first half of the year 2008, the flights and the nights of hotel were less dear than the previous year. 
In Germany, according to a current study, would be even limited until has 50 per cent. 
The flights and the nights of hotel would be redevenus about profitable -- this was the result of a study the express provider of and of journey American. 
The enterprise has analysed his data of reservation the first semester of 2008 and has established, afterwards a is raising the prices in the first quarter, one net decline in the profit in the second quarter. 
Afterwards that the prices on the market the hotels have increased matching piece the years, the night of hotel have already pounded to many of place. 
Of Jan at March, the prices increased in 41 the 48 European cities examined still of 6,9 per cent on average in comparison with 2007 in 41 the 48 European cities examined. 
Of Apr at Jun, the prices were however already 3,6 per cent more low than the previous year. 
The proneness has been net above all in Paris and in Rome, where the travelers did have paid to 37 per cent less than an year early. 
The causes of this would reside for express American in the weak course the dollars who has taken to a" desire of journey in decline in the American tourists". 
The financial centers such than Frankfurt or London would be likewise more touched by the retreat the prices the hotels by only the industrial sites like Hanovre, Cologne otherwise Stavanger. 
In the Swedish city, the prices the hotels hold with a rise of 26,3 per cent, the record in Europe. 
Also as regards price the the proneness flight, was at in the first quarter: 
The fact of the increase the prices the kerosene, the passing in economy class have the to pay on average for 7,1 per cent in addition which in 2007, the flights long-distance, very consumer of fuel, have even increased until at 29,2 per cent. 
Have been of Apr at Jun, the economic prices in class have fallen on average of 12,5 per cent in comparison with the previous quarter, ranks matter and in first first-class however, the variations of price have been widely less pronounced. 
In Germany, the prices have known a fall still more important than in the other European countries: 
Of Jan at March, the prices had increased of 11,9 per cent, in the second quarter, they have fallen of 23,6 per cent. 
The domestic German flights have been even divided by two according to this study by. 
The reasons of this fall would be of, explains the firm. 
The cèderait demand for the ground in many of segment the markets the journeys per airplane. 
Of, it would exist a marked pressure of the competition of by the treaty" open-cast open" who the circulation air between the U.S and the Europe liberalises. 
Sign of the tight situation was the removal by the profitable airlines the ride, thus only the high numbers of airline who would have gone bankrupt the the first semester 2008-- they support 24 companies nothing only in Europe. 
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0 
With a goal and the simple methods, the SV Hamburg grows first the rank. 
In the Borussia, Luhukay has always not succeeded in finding an eleven functional. 
Of Kristoffer Klein. To extend. Landing for player international Marko Marin. 
The player of Gladbach was going back that late in the game and his levé shooting grounded counter frames the goal. 
His message was precisely formulated, it had taken out of his lips of persuasive way. 
He quite simply knew that it had reason. 
"We need of this second goal", whistled Hermann Rieger in the passage the cloakroom of the arena of Hamburg. 
He did not dispense big thing in the cloakrooms, the half time finished if staled stale at their place. 
Rieger has been for nearly three decades the physiothérapeute the HSV, he enjoys a big reputation like good of former protagonist. 
And therefore his request has been received the strategic place. 
The entraineur assistant Cornelius Jol has acquiesé and has raised the thumb in order to approve. 
Cornelius were the brother of the entraineur in leader of Hamburg Martin Jol. 
Does seem the orders to have been similar And that that is jumping with this second goal! 
In practice the stake has failed. 
"All was very beautiful step to see today", confessed later on Marcel Jansen. 
Bastian Reinhard Bastian Reinhard would have" wished Bastian Reinhard to as be more relaxed". 
This 1:0( 1:0 at the half time), the team of Hamburg owes him to a strike of the successful head by Mladen Petric( at the 11ème minute); And the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach were able to not hurt of the weak player of Hamburg. 
"That has been a messy victory", summarised Marin Jol. 
The SV of Hamburg will celebrate this Monday his 121 years. 
Already Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky the top of the arena and the paintings of temporary first rank on the gigantic screen who indicated their club as of the class. 
Is going Ca to be a birthday without real party. 
"We know to step back the retreat", said Marcell Jansen. 
He suspects what the intermediate result the paintings does reflect more the unpredictable character of the first league only the domination of sound HSV. 
Equip him with his newcomers late committed -- the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the debauched goalkeeper Petric just like Jansen the FC Bayern-- indeed gently forms, but she does not shine still. 
"We need in addition of charm and in addition of dribbles", required Jol.

Of the dark matter influences the flight the space probes 
Ever since the years, a mysterious phenomenon leaves the researchers in the perplexity: Of the dark matter influences the speed the space probes for this which one calls the manoeuvres of gravitational support. 
The experts fear that the general theory of the relativity was not completely correct. 
Ever since almost 18 years, the space probe" Ulysses" is flying in the space. 
Because of conductions of fuel soon frozen, the cryogène death threatens her. 
Ever since the years, a mysterious phenomenon was cause of disarray among the researchers-- the anomaly of the gravitational support. 
The gravitational support was a manoeuvre whereby the space probes, do they elicit an additional fervor in the gravitational field from a celestial body, the land for example. 
So, the probes can save many of fuel. 
The probe of research américo-européenne Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, just like the probe solar Ulysses. 
This was this who surprizes the researchers moreover the the years: The flying objects do not behave always at 100 per cent of the way whose one waits for him according to the venerable laws of the gravitation. 
Well more, the irregularities appear at the level of the speed. 
The probes become of unexpected way more fast or more slow. 
Jusqu'à maintenant, the physicists were able to not explain this effect. 
They baptised the anomaly of the gravitational support. 
Sure that expert feared that the theory of the general relativity of Albert Einstein, who described the strength in order the matter because of of the curvature of space him out, was able not be completely correct. 
The physicist American Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton always believes hard like iron which Einstein did not make mistake and essaye to explain the anomaly of the gravitational support with the help of this which which one calls the black matter the astronomers identified in the universe. 
"The black matter would be able the black matter to be responsible for this anomaly, matter who of the land finds as nearby", he writes. 
The researchers of the space know the existence of the black matter only ever since about ten years. 
It is apparently emanating from her a strength on others celestial body. 
She, by counters completely invisible, east, that is to say that she sends neither reflect no electromagnetic radiation, all particularly no visible light. 
According to the calculations the scientists, the black matter would all the same represent a good cinquième of the whole mass of the universe. 
The tourists removed in Egypt were free 
Afterwards ten days the hand of their kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would have to be released as well as the Italian minister the matters Étrangères confirmed him. 
The Sudanese kidnappers had required a ransom from several million of euro. 
For the shooting preceding the liberation, six lessees would have been killed. 
In the south of the Egypt, five German have been removed. 
The negotiations for the ransom would be already bound. 
The German were relentlessly in the collimateur of kidnapper. 
WELT ONLINE depicts the cases the more important. 
The European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara were visibly free. 
This was this which have communicated in unison the Egyptian television of statehood, the chain of television Arabic Al-Arabija and the Italian media. 
The minister Italian the matters Étrangères Franco Frattini confirmed the liberation after the bulletins of the chain of television Italian Sky TG 24: "Our fellowcitizens and the other hostages have been released. 
We were in the process of to check their state of health", told Frattini. 
Well carry and safely am, announced the national Egyptian television. 
The 19 participants of the excursion in the desert would have already be in road towards the Cairo. 
The circumstances around a shooting before the liberation the hostages stay still blurred: So, the kidnappers would have summer nearly to put a term in the kidnapping, according to the dires of a security guard, front which the Sudanese army kills six the kidnapper without to shout station. 
"The problem was solved. 
They were in agreement with a ransom", announced the agent. 
It remained to collect the hostages", when suddenly," this surprise" has happened. 
Had pulled down this Sunday six the kidnappers in the border zone between the Sudan, the Chad and the Egypt, and had stopped two among them. 
The lessees had required from the Germany a ransom of an amount of six million of euro; The money had to be put back by to the German woman of a the hostage. 
The daily" El Masri El Jom" declared that, according to the dires of a German mediator, the liberation the hostages took the delay because the kidnappers feared for their security. 
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the hostages feminine after the payment of the ransom. 
The men the men had the men to be reserved until the kidnappers have found a road sure in order to flee. 
The German embassy the Cairo has refused to make all comment on this tale. 
Abuse of a father-in-law" who led to the suicides" 
A court has been informed of by his father-in-law by only the years of infligés abuse have led a woman to commit suicide. 
Michael Trerise, 57 years, of Stithians, in the Cornwall, has been imprisoned for six years after to have admitted eight leaders lane of indecent fact. 
The court of big authority of Truro have referred what what it did regularly interlink his step daughter, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, of 5 at 7 years. 
Trerise has written in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death". 
The court has been well-informed that Melle Randle, old of 34 years, has committed suicide at she at Mutley, Plymouth, the 1er Apr 2007. 
Child when she lived at Coventry, Trerise had tied up him up and bandaged before to pressure her into the the sexact, while his mother worked for the pub. 
Has divorced in the years 80, and he returned to live in the Cornwall. 
His step daughter was leaving for Plymouth. 
But the court has summer well-informed only Melle Randle voluntary, assiduous worker of National Trust, was hantée the abuse who had been inflicted two times by week by. 
The general prosecutor, Ramsey Quaife declared the courts the friends told Melle Randle, who was a surfeuse maid and cyclist, did seem since 2006" emotionally dead ", and" lost all expectation towards the life." 
In Apr 2007, his true father, Terrance Randle, has found it dead in his flat at Plymouth. 
One thinks that she has committed suicide in himself choking with a plastic bag. 
Mr Randle faced the beautiful father of his daughter moreover, written: "I tied him up and bandaged her regularly". 
"I have not abused her sexually. 
"I feel responsible for his death." 
The judge Christopher Elwen has said to Trerise: "You were really bizarre like fétichiste, your victim had to be certainly terrorized, above all at the age of 7 years. 
"This unpleasant saga has ended in the suicide of the victim. 
And this who still more surprizing, this was the fact that if she had committed this gesture, his story would be certainly never finished the court". 
He added: "I in particular underline, such than describe his father and his mother, the effects of your crime committed matching piece the years on Stéphanie. 
"Without this one, it would be arguably today one young happy woman, promising, and of success." 
Sentence for loss of official data. 
The ministerial officer of the office Cabinet who had forgotten the document secret top, in on a train, Jun will be boarded-up by the Official Secrets Act, has known the BBC. 
The man the ministries was in displacement when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train towards Waterloo. 
The documents were past in the hands of the BBC before to be delivered to at the police.

Society the building against the bill B&B. 
The British societies the building would be able to have to foot a bill in addition of £80 million, in order to heap the rescue of the bank Bradford& Bingley. 
The government has provided £14 billion in order to protect the stores from the 2.6 million of saver of Bradford& Bingleys. 
The interest of this loan will be paid by all the societies who harvest the money the the saver, including 59 societies the building. 
The general director of Building Societies association( BSA), Adrian Coles has declared that was" irritating" of knowledge which the societies and their members will have to take rap broken jar 
The loan of £14 billion will be repaid when mortgage them of Bradford& Bingleys will be clear. 
But the interests are going simultaneously to increase, will be produced, each year, the 700 financial company who the store harvest. 
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC, only the 59 societies the building include in this list. 
This was irritating of to show up only the institutions had a behavior careful must pay for some the bills the institution who were much less careful now. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
One proclaims that each society must pay for a sum proportional to the store which she holds, and what must the society intermediary pay for about 18% the cost. 
The treasure estimates that the interests the loans will rise in 2009, at £450 million. 
That wants to say that the societies will have to find £81 million in order to settle the interests of the first year. 
Adrian Coles general, director the building, the board commercial the society has announced to the BBC this decision seemed unjust. 
This am "irritating" to see that the institutions one behavior careful at the time of the resumption the walked property, must now to pay for the much less careful institutions. 
According to the BSA, no society number'has grounded ever since 1945, date the first annals. 
"We must examine all the aspects of this matter for, in order to evaluate the options to adopt in order to avoid only the societies the building and their members foot this salty bill» has announced Mr Cole. 
The interests in order 2009 cover seven month, of end Sep of this year until at end March. 
In 2010, will necessary to pay for the interests of the whole year, who would be able besides to double. it 
Seeing that the societies the building were the organisations without shareholder, their member ended up to foot the bill either the the more high loads, otherwise the the interest inferior rate for the counts saving.

Then one found a cyst in the vocal ropes. 
A street sinks in the city, Souvent Oubliée, and Peut Etre Bientôt in Vente. 
N.Y arranges of hundred of avenue, of boulevard, of street and others parallel roads famous, certaines, of the other exclusively functional. 
. And even some taxis veteran so only the local residents de longue date know to give the indications in order to go to Extra Place, for he has never meant him him to talk. 
The street finds the East Village and is covering the north of First Street to not mix up with Second Street between Bowery and Second Avenue. 
Of about 30 feet of open sea for 120 of long, she looks like a dusty avenue rather which at a artery activates. 
. No signs indicate the street. 
It was potentially impossible to find it on an atlas standard. 
This street however has the admirers. 
For example, it was Avalon Bay, the manufacturer the recent building of luxury on First Street. 
He would want repaver Extra Place, and to create a more fluid passage towards the stores and the shops, who would have to open in the real news. 
Of other admirer the the long-standing neighbor, has declared to be charmed by this shortened simply because it remains a the last and more former streets the pâté by. 
But the department of Préservation and the development Immobilier of the city who the street manages, has no interest to keep her. 
This agency month, at the time of a meeting the board of owner of neighborhood, the Rep. of city and of Avalon Bay have outlined a proposal authorising the manufacturer property to buy the street. 
But the board prefers that the street stays in the hands of the city, and has asked a new proposal to subject next month, has announced Susan Stetzer, the local manager the n°3 board. 
"It stays what little of space doing belong to the city, and we would wish that the city maintains Extra Place" she has declared. 
"They would be able to propose to put him back to statehood and to manage him, this which moreover Avalon would be able to make, but we wish to keep it public." 
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted repaver the small street and to instal there the seats, sure that would be besides used by a coffee which the manufacturer will grant to the space by. 
The proposal of this potential acquisition was publicised public at the meeting of this month. 
Of Milly, Michele concerns of Avalon Bay, word has declared only although the society wants to exploit the street, that does not inevitably want to say that she wants in being the owner. 
"The main interest of Avalon Bay was of relooker this abandoned avenue, and to publicise public" she has declared, stressing that this was the city to suggest to him the sale". 
Seth Donlin, a carries word of the preservation of the realestate business, has confirmed that the city well wished to sell the street, moreover underlining, which the mission of the agency was to develop the property rather what to manage. 
Comparative at his more coloured neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a light historical footprint. 
Some believe that Extra Place carries this name since 1802, when the inheritance of the big closes the numerous children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving of rated this boy boils of land, who did stay ever since abandoned. 
The subsequent entry the CBGB, a monument punk closed rock in 2006, have ray open to Extra Place; Was certainly more famous thanks to the photo in blanket of the album of Ramones "Rocket to Russia" 
"This place was magnificent" has announced Danny Fields, the manager the Ramones, who the photo in November 1976 attacked. 
It was full of scrap, of rag, barrel, poster, of leaf and of rope. " 
Some residents, including the bloggeurs who had already talked about the evolution towards the luxury of the East Village, have opposed to the idea to sell Extra Place, saying that this humble small property this humble small property would have this humble small property to stay public. 
Others have proclaimed Extra Place like a true scarcity -- a fragment potentially identical at the city who who would have to be fichu in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, who driven a blog denominated Jeremiah' s Vanishing N.Y (titled" Le Livre the protests: One Regard Amèrement Nostalgique on Une Ville in the process of Extinction") relates the story of the city and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The new Yorker. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "First-rate Place am a small cul-de-sac narrow, dark of, and bounded by the doors of a warehouse in and the shutters, full of newspaper of the past week who are taking off the gutter." 
At few of exception close, the street always has the same look. 
A rat is nimbly running basically of the alley, near a door who led long ago to the CBGB, and who has the seat of a clothes shop stylishness now became. 
The graffitis on the walls, one bottle of beer of 22 ounces empties, rely on quoted thrown away. 
Some passersby has declared to think only rarely about Extra Place, and suggested. 
Mr Field, of rated sound, has declared to think that some cents estimated the appeal of the street in his current state. 
"The good years of my life" he has declared," have occurred the the dark place, humid and disgusting". 
The debate Bilingue: Immersion in the English language 
. Izumi discuss of the position the candidates by the way of the bilingual education. 
Spear Izumi, former member the studies in California, and former department head of education the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, east the co-author the not as good books" which you thought. Why must the middle classes be able to choose their school. " 
To be an intricate business the favours the Hispanic voters. 
The proposals of Barack Obama on the education were an interesting example. 
The country of Mr Obama underlines what" what" the students Afro-américains and Latino do have fewer of chance in order himself diplômer only the white students. "This was a truthful fact. 
In order to fight these differences, the program of education of Mr Obama supports in particular among such others subjects," the transitional bilingual education" for this who learn the English. 
However, the question who am posing for Obama was to know so sound desire to achieve a bilingual education who the education defends in class of other language only the English, is going besides his interest aiming to eliminate the differences. 
For example take, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school of the east the recounted. 
The students of this school were in Hispanic, and of low income. 
More of a third the student, constitué of numerous news managed, studies the English. 
Among the students the CM1, 100% have passed the exam of 
Likewise, almost 93% the students have passed the exam of anglais-de langues-d' art 
This incredible success was suffering thanks to an other ingredient that this advanced by Mr Obama. 
Sixth Street bets on the the analyses, of the practice, a constant evaluation the abilities as well as an exemplary attitude. 
In more, and there an example which Mr Obama would be able to copy, brings back Linda Mikels, main the Sixth Street, this school has instituted the education of the English language" full immersion ". 
The total immersion in English language focuses on the almost constant use of the English in the education. 
Melle Mikels, contrary to the bilingual education, has asserted" us an enormous success with one studying has just to arrive from the Mexico, 12 months afterwards, if you were going without his class, you no chance to identify. " 
"That is walking, she watches," that has walked for we" 
Mr Obama would have to not take example the Sixth Street Prep and to reply to him in the other compound schools in majority of Hispanic student learning the English. 
The excellent results talk about them even by this school; But the policies on the education inside his party( the associations for the education Nationale support for years the bilingual education) and his enormous support for the bilingual education, darkened the prognostic of the answer of Mr Obama. 
Although it was favourable by the way the immigrants learn the English, Mr Obama has recently considered this question like insignificant, when he proclaimed that we must all stop to argue on the wording the laws in English language. 
"Au contraire, he declared," you must assure you that your child speaks Spanish". 
If Mr Obama really wishes to eliminate the differences, he would have then to consider with attention, shape of education who function, rather than to despise them or to consider them like insignificant.

With a victory in 2: 03: 59 of an accommodating running on the flat, Gebrselassie has beaten of 27 seconds his record of 2: 04: 26, fought last year in Berlin. 
At 35 years, Gebrselassie has won the 26ème world record career during which he has won the world championship or the world-wide record in order outdistances, the 1600 meter the marathon. 
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Olympic marathon of Beijing, fearing-- can be of exaggerated way aux yeux today,-- that the air pollution increases his problems of asthma. 
Au contraire, he promised to run in Berlin. 
The the almost perfect condition sunny-- time, 48 degrees the start, 55 at the arrival -- Gebrselassie has earned Sunday, keeping an impressive average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 second 
The converted runners of track like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, all two Kenyan, in runner of when melts, have contributed to the reduction the records the marathon in addition of two minutes in these ten last years, since 1998, the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa gagna in Berlin in 2:06:05. 
After the victory of Sunday, Gebrselassie has announced to the reporteurs, asset suffered of cramp the calf two front week, and to have failed the training for a week. 
It was obvious that the rest has allowed to him of resté brilliancy, but not rusty. 
"I was so happy," he has announced to the reporters. 
"All was perfect. 
I have deferred to there last week, and today, I had the doubts; But in the end, all has gone to the better.""

In a city at Part, the hubris and the tests of the life Noire 
Hidden in the development of his huge park, at some thousand of the sunny, the brilliant and the gigantic Orlando, find a quiet petite ville where were born the pride and the complications of the experience Afro-American. 
"Eatonville completely black, first city to integrate, house of childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, in 1935, this description which it made was more so simple to make nowadays." The city the five lake, three courts of croquet,, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, plein of goyaves, two school and step of prison". 
She has now became a city of pilgrimage 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the Zora Festival who each year at Eatonville, in order to give back tribute to Hurston holds on, the writer the more celebrates of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And of several ways, the city only she describes-- has grown tourist thanks to his inclusion in the tourist guide of the Florida published-- era Federal Writers' Project-- remain a place aside. 
It was also independent, worthy, and private that it was already in the years 30, when Hurston told what the rural black population of Florida was often reluctant to share his true thoughts with the white man, who" knowing so little, ne knows not this which he loses ". 
Even if it was a matter of the year of the election of a black president, the Sen. Barack Obama, who who an open dialogue on the theme of the race has besides put forward, here many stay careful the looks of the stranger. 
"We were very careful as for the way to tell the story" has announced Hortense Jones, 59 years, résidente since always and the more former parishioner of the city. 
"Necessary that it was compliant at the reality it. 
Eatonville has been a long time defined like a paradox the triumph and of fight. 
She at once represents an historical model of an hold of power the black as well as a community of almost 2400 persons where the rate of poverty was two faiths the national average. 
It was a matter of a central point but also of a sudiste example of rural black culture -- some time despised, others times cheered-- who the birth of the American slavery call again. 
This who would explain why the residents were at once proud and protective. 
The born interest towards the picture of Eatonville with Zora, here only all the world calls Hurston. 
She introduced his home town to the whole worlds the the sincere books, full of dialect, such only" Mules and Men"( 1935) and"" Their Eyes Were Watching God"( 1937). 
Five paragraphs in the guide of the Florida transformed this city, placed exactly at the exit of road 17, a road who sleeper centres of the Florida, often oublié, who succeeded in chapter of the black story and the human drama. 
Bold telle a bass drum in the life like in the literature, Hurston has led the readers the store of property the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr Joe Clarke, who was then divided by in several private parts. 
"Write the road on the left", she," you will find the modern public school brown and white, with his gardens and these playgrounds good maintained whose Howard Miller does always have busy care, good only he knows hardly to read and to write. 
It moreover made mention the new husbands of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells the drinks of all kind as well as all this who who can serve the people of passage. 
Thus, in hardly an hundred of word, Hurston associated Eatonville with a car government but also at the analphabétisation, the remarriages, and the sex. 
Bien évidemment, Fodor not were thus. 
This was not in fact a portrait which everybody valued. 
Zora has well described the reality "has declared Ella Dinkins year, 90, a the girl of Johnson which Hurston has immortalized, quoting the songs without colour, interpreted." 
She added: "Sure that person has not valued". 
One always remembers Hurston like a person lively and eccentric, who was frequently returning afterwards that his family has moved at Jacksonville, Fla. 
Augustus Franklin, 77 years, reminded that Hurston was d'habitude arriving at and, where even today, one was proud of the usual clothes. 
Numerous resident were fascinated, Mr Franklin has told, while many laughed at her. 
"The people were always happy to see Zora" he has declared. 
But he moreover adds, swinging in his chair the subsequent patios who gives on Lake Sabelia, Hurston was certainly baptised, what" it never remained too many long ". 
At the death of Hurston in 1960, it was poor and his books were hors production. 
Eatonville and seemed the whole world to have forgotten. 
Good which which it was long ago a star of the literature, a contemporaine of Langston Hughes and the lonely black woman the Barnard College the years 20, it was buried in a grave indifferent, at Fort Pierce, Fla, she lived. 
At Eatonville, no big commemoration, neither of plate for the generalpublic. 
I do not think that they have understood the contribution or the inheritance which she offered to the worlds "has announced Valérie Boyd, author of" Wrapped in Rainbows", a publiée biography of Hurston in 2003. 
A crucial time was occurring in the years 1980. 
The public civil-servant of Orange County wished make to go from a freeway to five lanes in, in order to replace the boulevard Kennedy main, street at two lane of the community. 
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 until at the western angle of the city. 
The proposal was done while Eatonville all exactly bounced back of a sticky patch of his story. 
A forced integration, among such others things, has put end in the relatively idyllic isolation of the community. 
In the years 50, the argument on the mixture the race has led the hatred to the doors of the community. 
"At that time there, a bandages were coming of young white to throw the oranges or the objects against the persons seated on the rated" has announced Mr Franklin. 
"A lady was even deceased." 
They threw a watermelon of their car". 
In a letter of 1955 addressed at The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston queries the request of the supreme Court aiming at a forced integration, defining his decision in v Brown. Board of Education" insulting rather only glorifieuse of my race ". 
The residents proclaim now the elimination of the racial segregation in the schools, well only positive in some aspects, has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and weakens the confidence the young. 
"The black children had the habit to be kissed -- I well remember -- one kissed our master in the morning, and the evening as" has announced Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins as well as director in leader of the safeguard of the community of Eatonville, a nay groups profit. 
That has lasted, she added, the the times the teachers and the students were coming more from the same place. 
"You do not kiss your white professor because it was white -- I want to say that he there here," a cultural borderline has announced Melle Nathiri. 
The civilian rights, moreover, have allowed to create of the space for good of the other Zora Neale Hurston black-- writer, actor and artist who have gone besides the damage, such than she, armed of a cheerful own confidence and the line of conduct such than: "how can they deprive the pleasure of my company!" 
That outpaces. " 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker has given back on the anonymous grave of Hurston and has begun to fight in order make to relive his reputation. 
Five years after, a biography cheered on Hurston achieved. Hemenway, a true best to reintroduce her thus the American cannons,. 
The plan of the freeway has arrived exactly when the famous girl the more of Eatonville had found his appeal. 
And this time, the old neighbouring of Hurston consider a sauveuse. 
The community has begun to organise a festival Hurston in order to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences which this freeway would generate. 
Have come to the inauguration the festivals two years afterwards, and many are returning in Jan, in order to commemorate her. 
After of numerous year, the recounted has rejected the proposal of the freeway. 
"The fiasco of the freeway in order five lanes, extremely fast, one true civic pride" has announced Melle. Nathiri. 
Melle Boyd has summarised the whole declaring which" Zora has saved Eatonville". 
The victory against the plan of the freeway has allowed him to change his own picture. 
The not résidentes persons, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who our depuis1993 church frequents, were beginning to come in big number, and the residents were beginning to reconsider the past. 
Eatonville was classified historical city since 1998. 
A library mono theme( renamed of course) ouvra in 2006, on one magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repavé. 
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for the Florida: At six of Orlando, she can at any one time to consider himself like a subsequent back street at the time of an estival day, small such than it was when it was well-founded by 27 black families in the years 1880. 
(One counts today 90 per cent of black) 
The strangers are coming to discover the story of Eatonville, his reason be, were still treaty with caution. 
Necessary to ask the permission for the most part the interviews it, and some things -- like the walls of the hurdygurdy church of Eatonville, peints by the white man, illustrating the black men in the fields-- have to be not photographed. 
Much at Eatonville, as Melle Jones, a brave teacher and have a weak for the lively red, always have fear that their insular community was well included. 
However, considering the expansion the festivals Hurston, a certain local level of hubris was émergé. 
In person, the young tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered his race whole: Beautiful woman, problem and whole, neither better neither worse, but as proud, creative hard, worker mixed, lunatic and only the other groups ethnic and racial in America. 
This was well of the civic sincere affection that one hears in the voice the nephew of Mr Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18 years, who does foresee to go back on Eatonville after the college in order to work for the local government or in order force them who of Police, do need of additional strength. 
And even for the more young, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11 years, twin of Winter Park, seem to have learnt properly the description Eatonville. 
"La plupart the people, who are going from this area there, will think:" oh, this city has nothing compared to others" Alondra Kenon has ruled afterwards the mass Sunday last. 
But if you stop and, this was a very beautiful city". 
Here in N.Y, all routinely speak finance. 
Despite everything, nothing has changed. 
If the tourists in Manhattan held distant from the kiosks and the gigantic screen of TV at Times Square, they.

The deliverers continue to edge on the pavements, with their wagons and their trays of muffins for the matinières meetings. 
The Latino always lag between the residential buildings reporting, the the mules, a cinquantaine of luxurious shirt hanged at an yoke willing on his shoulders. 
It the officeworkers continue to queue up tail in order to buy their matinier sandwich for the street vendor, and it was always impossible to find an h taxi between 16 and 19 h in. 
I had not felt the crisis despite the tales completely pessimistic until at this post meridiem when I decided to go to open one news counts of saving. 
To work in finely according to noon, a score of person making the tail. 
Not in front of the counters the cashier, neither in order to remove of the species or faire one payment, but in front of the counter the customer service, the usual customers ordered their check books, the tourists asked the direction for the store Macy, and the new customers opened the counts. 
La plupart of this owing me, I would learn later on of Starr, my personal authorized" banker", all queued up tail for the same reason only me. 
Step of the same way, then they had already removed their economies the more small banks, like this the New Jersey, of Pennsylvanie, and Staten Island. 
They have removed their money the savings thrifts account denominated (telle a society the bâtiment), the associations of, and the type of local savingsbank and their subsidiaries who function only in a state, and who do say to treat the customers like their family. 
In recent past one, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.

The office and the employees of store who were in front of me, terrified of an other potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank seem them reliable, was this who of rescue makes the more in Wall Street. 
The indifferent New Yorkais have grown very familiar the worlds of the finance these last weeks. 
"I meant a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, to talk to the telephones about Lehman Brothers, the bank makes bankruptcy, and of his thin general director Dick Fuld, with la même familiarity which she would have been able to have in order to criticise a colleague. 
And Lyn, the caretaker in, has changed the subject of our usual conversation by the way of Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my greengrocer of fruit and vegetables. 
She has said me, following my visit at the bank. "I have put all my economies in the market the monetary funds. 
"I have changed, I want to not take of risk".

Of the artist. 
Of the other, the person. 
Inseparable except in the privacy, in these unknown instants the generalpublic, where one uncovers the the private gesture and the looks stolen the artists who do not care to go up on stage. 
The German Günther Bauer blends in "Flamenco -- people" the théâtralité of some productions the the singer, the dancers and the guitarists with this side less known the artists. 
In this plan, the photographer takes back the particular iconography the flamencos under various angle.

These persons are the artists capable of transmitting on stage of the passion, of the sadness, of the joy" in the street"... While fascinating the public. 
In order to catch the moments of personality of these artists necessary to not make of photo on stage it. 
They have a personality and a distinctive character. 
This who interested this was to create a private atmosphere affords to catch with the camera the moments of personality the stars the flamencos ". 
With the festival popular" chant the mines", Bauer has started in 1997 one long journeys in order to photograph the singers, the guitarists or the dancers with a camera plate. 
This am the portraits recalls the classic photograph. 
The implementation of various stylistic mean breaks with the classic side of the picture, in giving a key of modernity, this reflects the perception the flamencos according to Bauer: "A music the the very usual roots who and evolves who each day surprizes". 
It was not a matter of the dance neither the chant in himself, but of the personality and the character of the artist who the public with fascinate. 
The research of the essential and of the magic has been the permanent feature of this work which one introduces these days ci to the gallery El Fotómata. 
The stars the flamencos like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, between the other, belong to of the made selection to leave from about seventy artists photographed. 
The plan has turned to an anthology the flamencos, who will be soon published in a book.

Although the concepts were various in "Flamenco -- people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait the people, to know them and to be able to go in for their life for a more or less long moment. 
I believe that in the photograph the portrait was the kind the more difficult. 
You find person, of character which sometimes you know step otherwise who only some minute in order to be able to do to them a photo leave you. 
Despite these circumstances, like photographer, I always try what my ideas do become reality".

The America plait less without Paul Newman 
"The time god creates the perfect persons 
Paul Newman belonged to ". 
This sentence was of the actress Sally Field, have finely-worked with him in" absence of mischievousness", and well illustrates the despair the American cinemas, and of all the America, face at the striking idea which Newman was plus of this world. 
He had of the trouble to get an Oscar 
He was turning more ever since 2007. 
Everybody knew that it was sick. 
That has been a body blow for everybody. 
"Sometimes this which one feels outpaces all expression, and now I has lost a big friend", mourned Robert Redford," my life and my country were good thanks to his existence". 
Nobody had fear to make ridiculous or to exaggerate. 
A the father the the cinemas and of the homeland was dead during a particularly dark period, where the terrorists and the stock-markets do make fear, estimate the American has fallen well low, in desperately looking for the motives of dignity. 
It when the times were so hard and without reason for living, has the humanbeings only the admiration it and it was not necessary to be Luis Cernuda in order to like Paul Newman. 
He embodied for everybody an ideal of beauty and of truth. 
He has been the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender the causes lost and beaten, like the foundation for the fight antidrogues created in honour of his deceased senior at an overdose and the creation of his own mark of bio food. 
This was a victory for a country of the trouble to stand out against a dietary suicidal culture. 
This expansive spate of admiration swept Hollywood without to make attention the neither the nationality neither the passport. 
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, has noticed that no James Bond was dead before him. 
An English other, the oscarisé Sam Mendes, said what to work with Newman has marked the top of his career. 
The bad boy arrived of the Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to appoint Newman like his more big inspiration. 
"He has placed the high bar", noted George Clooney, who was perhaps the lonely who today does try to pierce the screen as Paul Newman has made him: While being very honnêt and while having a private life serious and far from the objective. 
This number'was always not easy or possible in the jungle media nowadays. 
But it was this who essaye, and Paul Newman was an example. 
After a divorce, it has been married fifty years at Joanne Woodward, at who he has been faithful even if the opportunities failed him step in order not be. 
"But why would I have to eat an hamburger out of at me, if I have a beefsteak in my fridge?", he had the habit to joke. 
The sky, he assists with hubris à la rencontre of his daughters with his fans on land, something who was not so usual in America. 
"Among all the big roles it have interpreted, he has never been as proud than this the devoted husband, the infatuated father, the considerate grandfather and philanthropist", he say. 
Madrid in the running at the organisation the Olympic game of 2016 
And yes, the dream of much among we was that Madrid was able to organise the games, after the failure in 2012, that would be able to achieve in 2016. 
But me I wonder if we were ready. 
If we take the example of the running of: We were not! 
They call it the perfect running, but according to me this was the worse running which I have never participated in. 
If they had taken in count all the mistakes occurred for the running, this one would make the object of an eliminatory note. 
But examine all in and dès le début. 
The mistakes start who with the withdrawal the numbers, require you to go to there in. 
That was quite a lot of but if they make to move this would be better than they gives all( including the computer chip for the running). 
And bien not 
They did to you outward journey there only in order to take the number (first mistake, to move only for) and( after a long line of wait) surprise!, it had there what the undershirt does carve out'S'in order (second mistake, because I need of) 
What world do we live in? 
Est-ce-t-il because of the crisis they have decided to buy only the undershirts of small size with fewer of fabric and as a result fewer dear? 
This well, was nothing with respect to this who the day has happened the running. 
Apart from the fact that necessary to go to there very early in order to remove the computer chip it, the line of eastern wait of 15 minute and, in addition, he nearly to leave his bag dos at the entry. 
The wait has lasted more of 35 minutes, that was incomprehensible given that for 11.000 persons are waited for these running. 
Since he had a long line of wait, the competitions have started and we had not still left our backpack the entry, well only a time makes, the withdrawal has been worse. 
In addition, the rain has accompanied the wait in addition of 40 minutes during which have taken place. 
I believe that about 500 persons will have the pneumonia tomorrow, and some persons like me, will appear not even in the over time exact classification, because of the flea who, I think, has not marked properly the start. which they have given 
Of course, if they asked me to quote an example of perfect running, this one would be above all not coming to the idea. 
So I believe that we will always be able to dream to become the city host for the of 2016.

Impressive. 
But of course that represents the future. 
Now the enterprise has others things on which to concentrate on, for example on the next version of his operational system, Windows. 
This week one has talked moreover about a change of strategy at Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be more light and he will have pleased as much of associate program. 
Steve Ballmer has discovered only if the computers were sold with the essential the place of useless application, would be going five times more quickly. 
That represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped of added the the function and the" treat" at Windows. 
The change of strategy was the welcome. 
Microsoft has reason, his operational system loses of importance but also his software. 
When Google Chrome has arrived on the network, I have been one of this who has adhered to the theory according to which Google Chrome was the first approach on behalf of Google in order to do competition to Windows. 
Several persons have stressed rightly that a web browser internet was not an operational system. 
The operational system will always be necessary since this was the essential basis for only the computational equipment and the software understand. 
He occupies the same function only your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother in law. 
This was true. 
He will never disappear but it necessary to see the" death" the operational systems not like an absolute truth but like a relative truth. 
This week, Ballmer has confirmed this idea. 
The people do less and less mindfulness the operational systems but more and more to the web browser internet. 
One lights the computer only in order make to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and each day the people are spending more of time to sail on the Internet to cover the windows. 
At who do the thick applications with the system serve the half? 
Who can the more can the less. 
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer of application, much less than Vista. 
Heavy minus congested, month complex, minus. 
Pour le moment, Microsoft interests more the launchings of online so that they finally become an alternative to Google. 
They desperately need of, indeed, and I take a lead. 
The present picture in this article, has been taken at the beginning of this month in one the room of rest reserved the employee of Microsoft at Redmond. 
On the machine of drink, a displays their request to use their own tool of research --" your research. Our future". 
In 2006, a study concluded only 66% the employee of Microsoft used Google in order to look for the information on. 
Last week a delay has happened in the new upgrade of Windows Mobile 7. 
She will not get out at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end 2009 otherwise to see of 2010. 
Microsoft will safely try to speed the same times Windows 7 and Windows moving 7. 
The telephone, after all, more and more looks like a computer. 
But the launching of Android en retard being and the iPhone being already on the market, will cost dear. 
The fabulous Marcel 
Pablo Picasso endorsed him on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio concerned a in the 'diamond of blood'of Edward Zwick, of even only Al Pacino in' and the godfather'of Francis Ford Coppola makes part of the dress of the association the muscular gays. 
And if we start to enumerate all his appearances, one would be equally able to quote this sturdy whiskered who was bringing up the weights in an itinerant circus. 
This was not only a simple undershirt in cotton, and moulding sleeveless. 
The English call'tank' but the fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others. 
Whole of manner, by his blazing name -- although it was known under the name of 'Marcel'-- who who has to see with the sport since he takes the name, according to the legend, the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf. 
He' Marcel'stands out from the other by his excellent cotton, by his unisex bowl, by his distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag( hardly recognizable) which the undershirts have in the neck. 
But look out, for the Belgian mark does not produce only only the tank tops. 
But she equally produces the sweat-shirt, the boxer rétro, the cardigans in cashmere, the trousers in cotton, the babies, the shorts... 
The designed clothes for the comfort the underwear. 
Even if it was harm to carry them only like underwear. 
They have too many of charm. 
"I want to become an young mother; The candidate does not worry" 
His enormous resemblance with his sister has step prevented from developing his own personality.

An very intense day but, in even time, exciting, waits for us. 
On what does your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season base? 
The cinema the years 50 and 60 delights us and we draw inspiration him much for our collections. 
I much likes to trail me in and to watch the women in order to see how they were dressed, how they combine their garments, I often make. 
Dancer, actress and drawer, you were a very versatile woman: Is it? 
I believe that yes but in the end all joins and these activities have beaucoup de choses in common. 
Since I was all small the garments pleased me; I wanted to go to my grandmother in order to look in the wardrobes at of my aunt and in order to see his garments. 
This was of genius, almost better off than to go to the amusement park. 
Then, when I have became dancer, I always tried to take care of my way to dress me. 
The dancers much well like to dress up for the yards and the tests, in order to look in the mirror and to feel well. 
And in the role of actress, when you endorse the garments this was by then there that you put really in the skin the character. 
As a result, all was connected. 
You he not a long time 30 years: Have that been hard for you? 
Not in the least. 
I feel better off than never, my 30 years delight me. 
I find that the woman was more ripe, have pleased of experience and savour the life with fewer of problem. 
The biological clock does not make fear. 
I have made all the things I wanted to make since all girl and that. 
Then, think you to become mother? 
Of course, I want to become mother because my body asks him and, in addition, I want to become an young mother; I want to not lose that. 
With respect to the candidate, I do not worry. 
This that I will make this was to give many of happiness my son and to bring him up with many of love.

The people which Naomi was a soft-hearted person. 
They so much say of thing on she, self I know, beaucoup de choses were not true. 
In addition, this silver lining of Naomi fascinates. 
She has asked me to march for a so noble cause, but if it had me to ask to make the peartree, would have made him all the same. 
The important this was to give back the good life to the wife the third worlds.

It was not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and the frenzy of the daily life. 
And in order to crown the whole, they are all listed in a book who the easy-going will bring the booksellers the 30 Sep. 
The alarm clock saddens us he ring each morning at 7 hours, but this was worse still when one thinks about the restless rhythm which the current life imposes on us. 
The office was synonymous with tension and the computer of pain the backs. 
The stress represents the pain the XXIème century. 
But it exists neither a neither two method in order to fight the daily tiredness and the problems connected to the worlds the works. 
But well 1001, neither a in addition neither one of fewer. 
Apart from the positions of yoga, the classic massage or the treatments'spa', Susannah Marriott gathered in the pages of a book all one'tiny'of method adapted the the tastes and the times of everybody. 
The antistress work entitles'1001 ways to relax'and will arrive at the booksellers directly at the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK. 
If someone believes that it was not possible to elicit from the quietness the the lieus like the work otherwise the the personal relations, this' manual'refutes a such belief. 
In addition, this manual offers others methods like the contact with the nature or the natural takings 100% who help to relax you. 
If the adrenalin is not running in your veins in order to restore the balance of your body and if the stress has became a problem, it was time to sit down to disconnect of his mind and to concentrate on the reading. 
To talk while sleeping 
Some children talk for the night. 
I bring back very réveillés step at this who wake up in telling something who the day of front, but the children who talk during their sleep. has happened 
The first time that that is arriving that can surprise you, but in effect that has step of importance. 
This was a mild distortion the sleep who somniloquie calls. 
This was enough frequent, above all at the children and at the adolescents. 
This was sure that it was him more of one who the night speak counterpart. 
This phenomenon can this phenomenon seem of very sporadic way( a time in the life for example associate at an episode of strong fièvre), otherwise of more periodic way( every day, a time per week, a time per month...), the day according to the child remembers more nothing. 
It does not exist of sole cause who his appearance determines 
They were often connected to others distortions the sleep like the nightmares, the nocturnal terrors, the nocturnal énurésies( to do wee to the bed) or the somnambulism, but this was not always the case. 
As we have already said he front, they can as they to be associate at of very strong fever, the the situations of stress or of overexcitement. 
Anyway this was a little studied phenomenon. 
The intensity with which he produces was equally very variable. 
It can that he speaks with a small quiet voice, the the isolated words, the murmurs otherwise on the contrary the the cry, the tears, the long speech... 
In the case where the somniloquie grows very frequent, it would be judicious to watch the child and to consult a specialist, in order to verify if it has there a problem who who many of anxiety provokes and in order to get an explanation at this problem. 
We have said that this was a mild distortion, therefore it does not have of treatment, unless this was connected to an other distortion the sleep who can be careful( for example, if this was connected to an apnée the sleep otherwise the the stresses). 
This that one can make this was to take in count one certain numbers of preventive very simple measure such than: 
To try to not arouse the child before to go to sleep. 
Therefore to look for the quiet games and to avoid the programs or the televised series who were more or less violent. 
The the very nervous children and who have of the trouble to relax, the techniques of relaxation can be used in order to help them to calm down inwardly. 
That will allow the child have a sleep more quiet. 
As soon as the somniloquies appear try to remain calm. 
Call again you what what they were innocuous in order the child and only the day-after he will remember more of this who has happened. 
Useful advice 
Do not wake up. 
This was unnecessary that since it was unconscious and you would wake him up. 
Even if he talks, he sleeps and. 
Call again you only if it proves very anxious several faiths, he is recommended to consult a physician or to check this who so much provokes of anxiety at the child. 
If you understand this which he says( this who was not usual), does not have the temptation to question him in order to get the information. 
You will get nothing, because sleeping, it was aware step in order to be able to organise his thought. 
To whom in addition, you will hear this which he says, but you will not know at what it was in the process of to dream, as a result do mindfulness at the way you will interpret the information and the conclusions that you pull. 
Never tell the child that you can question him for the night in order to know his secrets. 
Même pas jokingly. 
That provokes many of anxiety. 
In conclusion, do not worry, that was nothing of nasty good, this was an episode who lasts only some minutes.

They have not been according to the opposition. 
"We have been held the electoral commission and we our observers have not been able we to participate in the spareness", has lamented Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman of the Union the democratic strengths, one heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties. 
"This was a change cosmetically, underline Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate of the opposition at the presidential of 2006 and proeuropéen leader the movements, for importing this east who count the voices, and at we, this was the executive power. 
If the deputies of the opposition are entering the parliament, this was that they will have been called elected, step. 
But their entry the parliament can inform of the space of the television, the meetings in the areas and the proposals. " 
The opposition thus must to go in in the political game then" he nearly to shake the dialogue with the European union. 
Then if our economy, who am heavily gotten into debt opposite the Russia, is going in for crisis, and that we do not reform, we risk to become a protectorate of the Russia. 
Yet we we want we to be independent". 
The opposition fears that the organisation for the security and the cooperation in Europe have steady the electoral process recognises the validity the ballots. 
She stresses that the figures of participation too seem high, and only the generalisation the vote per anticipation( 26% the voters at Minsk) has opened the voice all the handlings. 
"You have noticed that it was an election, you? Questions the leader social-démocrate Alexandre Kozouline, one the two captive political liberated last in Aug of this year. 
It was nobody in the pollingstations. 
And it will at the maximum be five deputies of the opposition the parliament, this who suit the better the power. " 
The overnight silence is falling again on the place of October. 
At the television, the president Loukachenko and the members of the central electoral commission congratulate on their success. 
The interview -- the blood redevenu about sure 
Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday the 10e birthday of his foundation, and his president, the Dre Francine Décary, had reason delighted, for Héma-Québec has became one the effective supplier of blood the more law-and-order and the worlds. 
And above all, he has recaptured the confidence the publics who who the infected blood had been shaken by the scandal seriously by in the years 1980 and 1990. 
As one knows him, the national reserve of blood managed have been contaminated by the virus of the acquired immunodéficience( VIH) and the virus of the hepatitis C for the year 1980 by. 
In front of this drama and the discontent the publics, the government the Canada has instituted in Feb 1994 a public inquiry, presided by the judge Horace. 
While the judge Krever delayed to drop his report, some provinces have then put in foot a board for objective to plan ahead a new system of. 
The Quebec, the board Gélineau has fulfilled this mandate. 
At the continuation the report Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created the Canada: Héma-Québec in order to serve the Quebec and the Canadian society the bloods in order to supply all the other provinces and the two territories. 
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec has taken his activities up, hardly 38% the people had still confidence in the system of blood the Quebec, remembers the Dre Décary. 
The situation was discouraging. 
Who by dint of effort in order to improve the security the fiery products and of work on the ground for the years steady, we have regained the confidence the publics", she tells beforehand to assert proudly only at the beginning of 2008, near 94% of the population Quebec had henceforward confidence in Héma-Québec. 
The Dre Décary however keeps in front what" what" the confidence was something of extremely fragile ". 
From his creation, the 28 Sep 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the principle of precaution. 
At that time, one attended in Europe the hatching of numerous case of the human form of the illness of the mad cow, of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, one new variant of the illness tells this who the fort holds since his foundation in 1998. 
"And we not at all knew if this illness was able to transmit by the blood. 
One has then leant on a the main recommendation the report Krever and Gélineau, when one knows him not and only one severe disease can to follow from him, in the occurrence the illness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob who characterises by a degeneration the brains inevitably leading the death, one institute the measures of exclusion. 
In Apr 1999, one has thus refused the blood the person who had stayed more of a month to the U.K since 1980. 
Yet, some years ago, he has been demonstrated out of all doubt that this illness transmits by the blood. 
This episode has thus shown us that the assiduous principle of precaution which one has made the sense. " 
In 1999 has seemed on the market one technique much more sensitive of screening the VIH: The tests of nucleic acid( TAN) who afford to detect directly in the blood the giver the presence the virus himself and no this of antibody counters the virus, on which did the used tests until then settle. 
The TAN have allowed to shorten the silent period, who extends between the time where the person has been infected and this where the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist. 
One has been able to reduce this period to a duration inferior at a week. 
One has thus reduced substantially the risk that some givers were infected without to know him and that one was able to detect. 
These improvements have allowed to lower considerably the risk to contract the AIDS by a bloodtransfusion. 
Today, a person on 12 million is running the risk to receive the infected blood by the VIH. 
"In others words, that wants to say what will necessary to distribute 12 million of fiery product before someone is contaminated by the VIH by it. 
As Héma-Québec distributes each year between 400 000 and 500 000 fiery products, that will take more of 24 year before a case of transmission the VIH by a fiery product is occurring. 
I believe that one can feel at ease today to receive or to prescribe a bloodtransfusion in order to collect the health ", asserts the leader of the direction of Héma-Québec. 
"Our challenge in order the next decade was to maintain the security of our products. 
One never knows pathogenic is going to emerge in the system. 
Not later on that the past year has appeared on the island of the meeting the virus Chikungunya who, at the instar the virus the Nil western, is transmitted by an insect in the blood by. 
Necessary to be constantly vigilant it", pursues the Dre Décary before to underline only moreover of a supply law-and-order, Héma-Québec must as foresee a supply sufficient. 
"The needs increase because the population aged. 
The anti-cancer treatments being more aggressive, the patient often need of one refill in red globule otherwise in plaque. 
The ageing of the population also has the consequences on the network the blooddonors who of blood on average include only 3% the acceptable Québécois the gifts. " 
All person in health, old of 18 years and more answering the criteria of eligibility can yet give the blood all the 56 day, either six times per year. 
On average, 14% the person who propose their blood were not accepted, because they were suffering from the AIDS or of the malaria, for example, and where if they have traveled in a country the paludism rages, they will be excluded from for a period of an year. 
"With these 3%, we are managing to maintain an inventory who answers the needs for the hospitals. 
The shortages were very rare. 
But necessary to renew the members of this network of giver as they age it and can more give of their blood. 
Yet it was difficult to convince the people to give of their blood to retain them and to encourage them to become regular giver. 
The present-day life being so rampant, one rarely finds the time to pass an hour to give of his blood", distress Francine Décary. 
With an yearly budget of 297 million of dollar, Héma-Québec not only provides the fiery products, but also the human fabrics, the the transplant bony, the cardiac valves, the eyeballs and of the skin am almost exclusively used the big brûlés. 
These fabrics are analysed, transformed and frozen before to be stored at Héma-Québec who the lonely public bank of blood of cord manages as the Quebec. 
The umbilical cord who were long ago considered like a biomedical waste abounds with a blood rich in stem cell being able to serve to treat the severe diseases, such than the leukaemia. 
"One has celebrated, some weeks ago, stakes in bank of our thousandth sample of blood of cord and one foresees to take more of thousand per year. 
One would have to begin to propose him the the transplant at the beginning of the next year", point out the Dre Décary who this program of sample of blood of popular cord like very describes. 
"Several mothers were disappointed to be able to have there access", for Héma-Québec does not have the means of proposing this complex costly program and in all the hospitals the Quebec.

Charest bets on the north 
The first minister did not exclude to release the elections before the end of the year 
sitôt the general advice the liberal finished parties, Jean Charest has given back yesterday in jeans, at Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc( to the left of), tempts of make to elect sometimes of the present-day by election. 
"To reject the limits of our last big border the north": Such was the long-term ambition which Jean Charest has presented avec force visual whole in remaining in the big line, the term the general advice the liberal parties the Quebec, at Lévis, yesterday. 
Behind he, for his speech, was planned a kind of mill at picture. 
Were turning in loop, on three huge screens, the spectacular cliché of hydroelectric dam, of mining, the vu Quebec by" Google Maps", the card, etc. 
The big means like in electoral period. 
In point of press, moreover, the first minister has refused to exclude that he would release the elections this autumn, even if he made to notice that his schedule was very laden. 
The northern" plan" was the fourth piece of a" sight" which the first minister considers asset for the Quebec, this which of an economic" new area", which does an agreement on the manpower with the France, an agreement between the Canada and the Europe and the agreements with the Ontario understand. 
Often mentioned in the speeches the first ministers recently, the opening the north-- the northern territory the 49e parallel-- had never made the object of a presentation. 
The first minister has however confined to explain why the Nord was" a jewel the huge potential", has not given of term, of amount of investment, of priority neither points out in the plan has just. 
At most some avenues of this who would be able to be developed more: Among others the hydroélectricité, the forest, but above all the sector mining, hopped-up by the growth the emerging country and the reconstruction the public infrastructure. 
The north contains" nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, money, iron, titanium, and same diamond", according to the enumeration of Mr Charest. 
This big" territory two faiths like the France" ," this was at we, this was the Quebec. 
Not only this was at we, but this was in we", he has pressed ahead, like in order to well show what he sought a founding national myth. 
The Quebec has much built in his relation with the north, he has underlined: The rush towards the gold in Abitibi, the engineering Quebec, the bay James. 
"This was at we, this was our future", he has added, after to have made a theatrical break in order to contemplate the huge card behind him. 
The north, 70% the territories Quebec, understands a portion the Labrador the Quebec has always claimed, has specified the first minister the points of press. 
"This was an usual position which all the governments have repeated. 
A line of border on which it was not of agreement ever since very a long time and, when the opportunity turns up ago, I repeat this position the governments", he has pointed out. 
Au reste," with the climate changes, necessary to rethink our sight the north it", he has announced in speak the passage the North-West, who who all the year because of the cast iron the ice will open. 
In this new geopolitical context, the first minister estimate to only occupy the eastern territory one duty. 
And the inhabitants the territories, the first nations and the Inuits? 
The first minister has said that would be very attentive at their consideration and than the plan would profit, among others the young. 
Two former ministers coming from two various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau( former deputy péquiste of Ungava), have already shaken the consultations next to a trentaine of community. 
An interdepartmental board presided Julie Boulet (transport and naturalresources) has an important place shaken the works. 
The first minister did not exclude a big meeting," not necessarily a top ", but a time where" one will give a common sight". 
The development the north would moreover make in conformity with the principles the sustainable development. 
The northern plan will be" concerted, ordered and respectful of the environment", he has promised. 
Jean Charest has described this" sight" like being in continuity with this of first minister liberal who have preceded. 
"Like the liberals have us preceded, we have thought differently in order to turn the challenges into new opportunity of growth and of development." 
That has moreover been a who the themes recurrent of the end of week, has shaken Friday by a big cocktail in order to underline the 50e birthday of the arrival of Jean Lesage the parties. 
A the adopted resolution proposes to rename the plant Beauharnois in Barrage Adélard-Godbout. 
"Of Godbout, who has Hydro-Québec, at Lesage who has made the quiet revolution and the nationalization the hydroélectricité, at Bourassa created who has the bay James, our party has known to build up the future", made has announced Jean Charest. 
In in no wise of press, he put forward, conservative that one, the program" Roads to the North" of John Diefenbaker, first minister of 1957 at 1963. 
While reaching the plan of hydroelectric dam of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest has stressed that his stake in was foreseen for 2012. 
"That stays between we there, but I expect there", he has confided to his militant, arousing at them the heavy applause. 
En effet, the first minister, who said in Apr it would be not of election in 2008 and arguably step in 2009,, this which the law allows to him. 
He stresses that his schedule was however full, among others by a mission the advice of the federation in China and a top Québec-New York. 
The general advice of the end of week has provided the liberal leader a platform containing the nationalist resolutions, among others the constitutional" aspirations" who were past like one letter at the post-office: The PLQ in particular asks for the gratefulness the" specificity the Quebec" in the constitution. 
He also wishes that the Quebec appoints the members the advice of the radiodiffusion and the Canadian telecommunications and that these lasts have a right of veto on the busy decisions to the Quebec. 
The sides of the opposition, one has welcomed the big lines the plan Nord with scepticism. 
The péquiste leader, Pauline Marois, has brought out again the policy of development the Nord-du-Québec which the government Landry had thrown in 2001. 
According to she, the liberal government, while arriving the power at 2003, has given up to apply him. 
If he had made," one would be more advanced today" Mrs Marois the sides of his candidate in jeans has commented( ballot who takes place today), Françoise Mercure. 
The ADQ has said to lean the adoption on a northern plan by the government. 
"But this which one wishes for, this was that that was step exactly one spectacle", has commented on the leader Sébastien Proulx, in, who today is returning to holiday. 
Letter -- a country disgraced 
This was Mr Vic Toews, minister of the" justice"( ô irony) in the office Harper, who the last summer did afford to say of Louise Arbour that it was a" shame" for the Canada. 
To say he as long on the entourage the first ministers only on Stephen Harper himself thus the opprobrium on this woman who who a ceaseless fight for the justice has led and who all our admiration does deserve. 
Here front one government am the lonely, among all the western involved countries, to have not repatriated his enfermé national in the concentration camp. 
A government who does nohow take into account. 
The lonely government the fact only the Canada has signed the convention with Geneva, renounce his word and. 
The lonely who does defer to a parodies of justice in order to evaluate the guilt of the defendant. 
Call again, for memory, only the UNICEF, plead for the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order he benefits from a fair trial the Canada. 
This was this same government who close the eyes on the torture: Few matters that an adult young is henceforward psychologically destroyed, without doubt at never after such of year of exaction. 
One is not accounting still, but we attend at the moment an insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of our" democracy", this word which Harper stops to brandish and rings hollow. 
Here come the time where no moral exists more: One can manhandle, to torture, to imprison arbitrarily a Canadian citizen according to the good to want of an head of government so far minority (what in he being thus after the 14 October...). 
nombre of voter believe that they will find the wave in a party who advocate the virtue, the law and the order: They do not see what this government has given up. 
The shame, it Mr Toews, was there, in this renunciation, and step elsewhere. 
Free opinion -- the orwellien speech of Barrick Gold 
In his publishing the 17 Sep, Le Devoir has published a letter of Mr Patrick Garver, vice president director of the mining Canadian Barrick Gold. 
Pursuing an orwellienne logic, this one asserts only the more big auriferous company the worlds filed "a pursuit in defamation of six million against three authors and a small publishing penniless house with the aim of to throw a discusses transparent public". 
If it was true that the judges were independent and impartial, this was not the truth which they judge, above all in the case pursuit in defamation, but the law. 
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr Garver by. 
Do for, for Barrick Gold, would be to lead the ruin whoever dare to support a position contrary to his? 
Never mind the born of the trials, the authors and the publisher the books Noir Canada will have to spend the considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, at very unequal weapon, at an army of steady lawyer by the pockets almost bottomless. 
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, was besides often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a regulation at the amicable who the opposition will gag in addition to of to frighten whoever will dare to lean anew on the question. 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a debate public, this was in front of the public opinion that she would have had to present his sight the fact. 
Contrary to this who makes in several the countries where Barrick Gold works, the debates the Canada normally make by the exchange of idea and peal of truncheon. 
It was thus sufficient at the mining to open his books, his files and of to establish a truth discusses, across the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of team of research independent be able to make the light on the question. 
But Barrick Gold seem to not do confidence to the public opinion and rejects the backs of the hand the petition and letter of support the authors of black Canada. 
Would perhaps be able to explain how he can at once ask a debate" public" while despising the opinions of this same public? 
In the world the vice presidents, it seems that this word only points out the generously paid lawyer and no the set the Canadian; There a rather narrow sight the concept. 
In democracy, even the detractors have right to the word. 
This which Barrick Gold, this was that the public who supports the authors and publisher of black Canada makes him above all because he rejects the brutal way of the mining. does not understand-- otherwise wants to not understand-- 
This public was ready, but on the basis of civilized exchange of argument, and nay within the context of this only several perceive like a pursuit (pursuing the public" debate", Barrick Gold moreover has just to drop a notice the authors of Noir Canada summoning to stop the use of this term...). 
The surreal speech of Mr Garver, the eastern pursuit of Barrick Gold one direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the quest of truth, essential at all democratic society. 
She denies, en bloc, the right to the quote of source credibly and the debate about the facts and the interpretations, who do imagine the basis even the brainwork. 
If it was impossible to study and to discuss of subject who displease the rich de ce monde enterprises in a country like the Canada, under trouble of pursuit at repetition, who will be able to make? 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a debate public and transparent, she would be able to make him while following the scientific used standard by the author of black Canada. 
It has a right of answer. 
The academic middle, which we belong to, knows for years to manage the debates and the disagreements and to solve the conflicts. 
The disproportionate pursuit of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to this which she claims, it have no desire of a debate transparent. 
This was a loss for the academia, all like for the public debate the Canada, and it was time that the governments put in place the device limiting this kind to excessive pursuit. 
Rescue operation -- democrat and republican agree 
The administration Bush and the leaders the congress, at once republican and democratic, have in the end arrived at an agreement yesterday on the more big plan of economic rescue since the big depression the years 30. 
The new upgrade the plan of 700 billion of American dollar aiming to slow down the financial crisis who Wall Street shake the the month must still be ratified by the two rooms the congress by. 
She among others foresees: A good test by the elected representatives of his stake in application, of new mechanism aiming to assure the repayment of, of new arrangement in order to contain the numbers of house seizure for non-payment, as well as a right of look on the versed salaries to the leader the enterprises helped. 
The American secretary the treasure, Henry Paulson, the president of the room the Rep., Nancy Pelosi, and the republican Rep. at the bargaining table, the Sen. Judd Gregg, have announced the new maid some minutes after midnight, yesterday, to the term of a marathon of negotiation of. 
"We have achieved of big progress in the offing of an agreement who will be effective on the markets", has announced the Rep. of the administration Bush, Henry Paulson. 
"All has been made of way to shelter the real economy and the ordinary Americans of the crisis in yard in Wall Street", has explained the democrat. 
"This was the fundamental point: If we do not make that, the trauma, the chaos and the disruptions on the daily life the Americans will be huge", has announced the republican Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations had turned the sprint in the last hours per fear of the effect which a new failure would provoke on the mood the investors. 
The heure limite which one had granted was the opening the markets this morning. 
Joined late with the negotiation, the two candidates at the presidential American election have proven rather favourable for the agreement, without to fail to express their dissatisfaction only one either bound to arrive from him at this end. 
The democratic Sen. Barack Obama has allocated the addition of some arrangements at the agreement, among others this aiming to allow the owner to keep their domicile and this on the salary the ruling the surviving enterprises by the state. 
"When one asks the taxpayer to take the extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, it was step of to congratulate. 
But these measures were necessary", he has commented on the wave on of the American television. 
Replied on an other chain in order to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, his republican opponent, John McCain,: "I would like to see the details, but I do only yes hope." 
"The big lines which I have read[ show] that this was something what which we are all going to have to digest and are going we to be able to advance. 
The option of ne nothing am quite simply not acceptable ", he has said. 
The plan of 700 billion aims to buy back with the money the taxpayer the bad debts, active at risk and unsaleable the financial American institution. 
It is arriving at 14 months of a crisis released widespread of title of credit( PCAA) and to lead to on a frost the liquid assets and on the chaos the banks and the financial institutions. 
This was a group of elected republican Rep. made to overturn the first plan of agreement, last week. 
One believes to have broken of this logjam since the democrats have accepted that some assets" toxiques" the companies in were only assured by the government, rather only bought. 
In order to round the angles for everybody the Congress, one has also added an arrangement stipulating that if the government had to assume the loss for five years with this program, he would be able to put in place of news tax aiming to help him to recover his stake. 
The flat news foresees the payment of a first slice of 250 billion which will be able to add 100 other billion if the president judges it necessary. 
The payment of 350 other billion would have to be ratified by an other vote the congress by. 
In exchange of his help, Washington will get the participation in the enterprises helped who the dividends will earn him in the event of profit and when which he will be able to resell the storm will be past. 
The federal government will have the possibility to delay the procedures of seizure concerning the housing attached to the home loans concernés by this plan, as to fix the limit at the remuneration and the severance versed pay the leader the touchées enterprise. 
The architects the plan would like to see submissive the vote of the room the Rep. from today, and in order this the senate Wednesday. 
Despite all their efforts, it was not still sure that their plan will have the green light. 
The voices have indeed continued to speak up yesterday against this plan, so much in the republican camp only democratic. 
"Evidently, Washington does not hear", has announced for the benefit of his voters the republican Scott Garrett, member of the commission the finance of the Chambre. 
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem. 
Yes, the the solution. 
But not this who consists to profit the taxpayer". 
Organiser of a small huddle the congress presents the things differently" the caucus the sceptic", the Rep. democratic Brad Sherman, but am arriving at the same conclusion. 
"Four distinguished professors of economy, of three Nobel prizes, have written to us in order to say us: One asks the congress to not hurry up and to examine attentively the lane to take", he has announced yesterday. 
At the same time, in Europe, one once again had the proof of the world-wide nature of the crisis. 
The term of a meeting of, the three countries the Bénélux have announced the partial nationalization the group banking Fortis for 11,2 billion of euro( 16,3 billion US). 
The intervention the governments of the Belgium, the Netherlands and the Luxembourg had been made necessary after only the French bank BNP Paribas has made to know what she gave up to acquire his competitor in lots of wrecking since she has lost 2 billion of euro( 2,9 billion US) in the crisis the home loans at risk the U.S. 
Fortis uses 85 000 persons and belongs to the twenty more big European banks and the ten more big insurers. 
"This was not of, has announced yesterday the Dutch minister the finance, Wouter Bos. 
In exchange, one recovers a right to vote in the bank and of the influence. 
This was precisely something that the savers and the households appreciate now that the times look uncertain. " 
In the meantime, of of the English Channel, the British government seemed in the process of to nationalise an other bank manhandled. 
According to the English press, the government would take back at his count the set the loans in yard at the bank Bradford and Bringley, of more of 41 billion( 75,5 billion US) of home loan. 
The bank Spanish Santander has made to know what yesterday this was she who would buy the branches and the receivable accounts of the British bank. 
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, which the British government would have to nationalise all along of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman( 1925-2008) -- death of a committed icon 
His beauty aux yeux azure was a long time his card asset, d'aucuns will say his weakness. 
He had became liberated the narcissistic mirrors, the American winning actor the smiles? 
Yes and nay. 
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent who of source flowed will have equally taken away the register from power who enfante about the true sacred monsters. 
But what big runner! 
Paul Newman, extinct Friday, at 83 years, the continuations of a lung cancer, stays a the last icon the American cinemas the years splendour. 
And at who less monumental only Brando, he did look like whose whose it was a long time a kind of certainly more fragile rival at the screen, more careful in his game, but apostle also of the freedom and of the explosion the dramatic conventions,. 
The mixed bloods often make the magnificent children. 
It was born in Ohio in 1925, of a Jewish German father and of an Hungarian mother of origin. 
Of these European roots will be born a the glorious visage the American Dream. 
Without disproportionate ego, last mark of quality. 
For a country enamoured of the made man self all planned, the combatant of the war the Pacifique, casualty the fights, who the beginning the years 50 studied the dramatic art at then Yale frequented the s Actor' Studio of N.Y, before to triumph the theaters, at the television, soon the cinemas. 
This same man who militated for the civil-rights was also the automotive pilot who ranked second the 24 hour the Mans in 1979, double of a symbol sex, although member of a couples formed model since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward. 
Also disappear with him the areas, allergic to the brightness the show-business, whose riddle one will have not quite pierced. 
An honest man, the sense the more noble the term. 
The disappearance of Paul Newman has provided the vertigo with the cinéphiles this end of week, while his big roles on the black screen the memory clink. 
More of an half of a seventh American art in perpetual transfer is marching across him. 
Are coming back to scramble in memory the cowboy of charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid( 1969), the youngman rejecting his sensual wife( Elizabeth Taylor) in the cat on a burning adapted roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958. 
Plus close relation of we( 1990), one recalls sensitive sound gentleman Bridge, upset in his old age by a marriage who not fulfilled all his promises. 
So much of the other Paul Newman were past at the story. 
This anguished boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent,, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me( marked by the hatred), of Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean, taken back after his death, who Newman really threw in 1956. 
This likeable crook in the brillantissime The Sting( L'Arnaque), Oscar the good picture in 1973. 
Bitter billiardplayer and avenger in the magnificent The Hustler of Robert Rossen( 1961), he will take back the character he on the return in The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, worth in 1987 sound sole Oscar on nine appointments. 
This visage across the ages, this was him. 
Still him. 
The times jostle across his course. 
The young know him above all across the cultissime Slap Shot of George Roy Hill( 1977), in Reggie Dunlop unorthodox, coach of a team of ice hockey. 
His fans have found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy the brother Coen. 
With a last role of godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was curly. 
Against several legends the cinemas who dropped enough early the job, will have lived a long time in saddle, while denouncing Hollywood, his gold, his splendour and his concessions. 
The French film-maker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, no without," like a living challenge at" the underplaying" judging his benefits too intent. 
The profession has not always been soft for the beautiful Paul Newman at who were falling a long time into all baked in the beak. 
He however played less often the first young only the dropouts: Neurotic, alcoholic desperate, bastard otherwise, his perfect features reflected whose drifts and the revolts. 
Like editor, Newman revealed the mal facets known of his true modest sensitivity. 
Sound Rachel, Rachel, in 1968( according to the novel of the Canadienne Margaret Laurence), with sound marries Joanne Woodward in the main role, drew a thin feminine portrait of melancholy. 
Shined who his did get lost thread Scott per overdose he dedicated his picture Harry and Son in 1984, works of modesty and of sadness. 
Among the rain of tribute who was surging yesterday on Newman, his big mate and former companion asserted, very saddened: "His presence has given my life back and this good country."

Beyond his career of legend, if also erase a big militant for the civil-rights, the ecology, the independent cinema, a protester the drift of Hollywood.

He has left his five girls a letter containing these sentences: "Always and until in the end, your father has been incredibly grateful for his maid star.

And a privilege for we to have followed the course of an American artist so lucid and so generous. 
Citizen model, altogether and knew him. 
What were well able to make amp Zuschlag&; Company in their factory at bill? 
Shortly, the 8 October, are going to start the audiences referring to the criminal procedure in the process of, against János Zuschlag and his accomplices. 
The politician and his accomplices are accused of of swindle, sous forme criminal organisation, of way permanent and regular, having entrainé the particularly important harm. Others leaders have been reserved against them, like for example, fake and use of faux. 
According to the floor, the money coming from grant, was spent the the personal end, while the benefit were justified by of wrong bill by. 
The money of the state and the municipalities, about 65 million of HUF the total, was on the one hand going into the boxes the the movements Fiatal Baloldal and of somewhere else, in the pocket of some persons. 
Their method, rendue public also by the authorities laden with the inquiry, was to touch the money the obtenues grant in issuing the bills of expense, behind which no real benefit was thick and so, the associations did never honour their commitments. 
According to the indictement, a big part the bills were wrong. 
For these last, they provided the books of bill the markets of Józsefváros, while they made the seals at Kiskunhalas. 
For the names of society who who were going to appear in the bills, it was determined, amongst others, the round in province the north the lake Balaton, made, on demand for János Zuschlag. 
According to the deposition of this last, he had to spot the pensions and the restaurants. 
For his personal consumption, he asked a bill, on the model whose other bills were going they to introduce they achieved, between the other, the the ministry of the youth and the sport, the ministries the social matters and the work, thus only of the municipality of the capital in order to reach for the the grant. 
The majority the bills was created by István Lados and per sound complice András by laughed, who according to our information, did above all bother to write the files necessary at the procurement the grant. 
At the time of a" tour of location", one the choice of Lados were a café. 
According to the two bills issued Zuschlag in 2003, this place has assured the restoration of a group of 90 persons, member of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
However, according to the remarks the manager, it would have been impossible that as much of person occupy this place, simultaneously. 
Of the same way, in summer of the year 2002, the established bill on behalf of the ért foundation Jobb Jöv, who will afterwards the name of concern Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért, was swarming with mistake of form and of bottom. 
A pension, situated at Badacsonytomaj, in effect had only three rooms, and maximum ten persons were able to pass the. Yet, the bill mentioned hundred customers. 
The transmitters of bill at the imagination overflowing have equally fallen into the redundance, when they mentioned the society Pigal Kft, also belonging to the sectors Horeca. In their accounting, neither the ért name of Jobb Jöv, neither this of the Hoppá number' appeared, according to the given information the floors. 
Gy z Farkas, the manager of the society, has announced to the sites hvg.hu only when the floor has summoned him and him, what was it a matter of wrong document. 
"The name of our society and our number of tax were put in at a bad place on the seal." 
He added: "Of the form, Au delà makes him only according to the bill, hundred person have lived there, was not sticky no longer, since this establishment counts only eleven room, who who autant of place do not have. 
Our restaurant in addition, the bill also mentions the meals, and our restaurant was closed ever since well a long time. " 
The zealous transmitters of bill have not no longer found out about the travel agencies, belonging to of their choice but organising only the journeys,. So, naively, they have indicated the stays in Hungary the the bills to settle in, this is equally going counter from the accounting practice of the agency. 
Of surcroit, as he has appeared at the time of the inquiry, they also added the VAT on these documents, while the benefits concerning the activities whose of journey, the destination does find in outside of the European Union, are charged without VAT. 
De même, the rate of VAT the four established bills on behalf of the hotel Révfülöp at the order of Jobb Jöv ért was incorrect, since the benefits of the society do not support a VAT of 25% like appropriate, but a VAT of 15%. In addition, the employees of the hotel issue only the printed bills, while the wrong were rédigées at the hand. 
The inquiry the floors reveals that the" transmitters" have equally made the mistakes in mentioning like benefit the transport per road, than the society émettrice the bills was able to exercise, seeing that his profile was the advice in investment. 
In addition, this was also the the technicality, only the bills issued at the order of Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and of Biztos Pont have revealed wrong. 
Whole like in the case the society Ravenna Bt. otherwise the training sporting courses of Kunfehértó, who all two deny to be the authors the bills issued in their name. 
The forgers have not no longer lent mindfulness the fact that the society HIB Kft., established at Nyíregyháza, in liquidation when( in 2001) groups him of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to take a meal at them. According to our information, this was for this reason that the liquidator of the society denies to have issued this bill. 
Established bill deliberately 
An other category of transmitter of bill was this compound of this who were quite aware that he was asked to issue the fictitious bills. 
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the demand for the grouping of Fiatal Baloldal -- Ifjú Szocialisták, has established a bill at the order of the foundation Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért, in order a commands of four million of HUF. 
Of afterwards the indictement was brought to issue the wrong bills by a the defendant, Ludovic Györfi. 
Of even, has cooperated with the Zuschlags, the society Biogate Kft., who was currently under liquidation and who in 2003, has issued the bills at the order of the foundation Jobb Jöv ért Alapítvány, of the association Atlasz Egyesület and the association Vörösfeny Egyesület, pro one amount of about five million of HUF, but back which no benefit has been actually thick. 
No financial movement has taken place seeing that the bills issued have been canceled by the continuation by, but that, the body have well avoided to mention him in their accounting. 
The next category of society émettrices of bill was this the society directly connected to the defendant. 
Thus, the administrative delegate the general directors of the society Delta Trió Kft., handling the business of fuel and of motor vehicle, the registered office were where in Budapest, but it was there untraceable, was Iván Kubatov. 
In October, November and Dec 2005, this society has issued several bills concerning the sale of computational equipment, for an amount of about 18 million of HUF. 
Who according to the inquiry, these equipment would have been bought by the society Cash Investment Kft by. of Kiskunhalas, was the 14 Sep 2005 in liquidation ever since. 
The director of this society was a man of Romanian origin, at who Iván Kubatov would equally have fact to reach the document in report with the society, between 2002 and 2005. 
According to this which we know, Kubatov has recognised during the inquiry that he has issued the bills at the order of the society Atlasz, Hoppá and of Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and it have pocketed their exchange value. 
This was precisely at the demand for Iván Kubatov that the Romanian builders have created the societies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. 
En réalité, no of these societies functioned, this which the defendant explains by the fact that they did not receive of work. 
He all the same used these societies, since at the demand for Maître Zsolt Szente, co-defendant as well as editor the action of foundation the society, he has established the bills in order their names, at the order of association referring to Zuschlag, like the associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció. 
Kubatov has given the the body, 15 bill the total, issued, for a value of 14,2 million of HUF. 
The floor thought only 10% the appropriate sums on the bills as well as the VAT were going into the pocket of Kubatov. 
The man has even used the society Szi-Beri Bt. in order to establish the fictitious bills have summer used within the context of the demand for grant of Biztos Pont. 
In Jan 2006, the association Y-Generáció and Szövetség has Modern Magyarországért have introduced a demand for grant next to the body to public usefulness the socialist parties, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány( TMA). 
They have gotten this grant for an amount of two faiths 500.000 HUF, but these amounts have been not used for the appropriate objectives in the request. 
In order to avoid that that knows, five fictitious received bills of the society Works Team Kft. have been introduced to the TMA. 
Moreover, this were these bills who have been found at the time of the search made in the office of Árpád Kemecsei, the ministries of the education. 
At the time of of the audience, a part the defendant will relate the method of manufacture the bills, as she had already made him in front of the floor previously. 
This who would be able to be really interesting would be that the principal defendant, János Zuschlag himself, decides to raise the veil on all the story. 
Up to now, his admissions were not very detailed, and although he has promised time and again to tell the lesser details, he has not still made him. 
The question was to know if this was in his interest, ou alors, possibly, the socialists would have concluded an agreement, Zusi would lonely the carry hat. 
Today, this last was likely upset, since ask them for his investment in residence surveillée, on basis of a reduction of his conditions of, are continuously falling into the ear of deaf one. 
For only this who have caused the much more important harm, and the authors of economic not repairable crime, are freely strolling or at least, wait at home for the end of the procedure. It does not have this possibility. 
The psychology of the overbid: Why does t-on spend more of? 
At the time of auction, the buyers have proneness to spend more to overestimate the merchandise 
The researchers in neurology and in economy of the university of N.Y have succeeded in putting up to date the bases neurological and economic in this known irrational behavior and apparently. 
According to their publiée study in the review Science, the humanbeings want to be not outdistanced at the time of this type of competition, like for example an auction on eBay, and therefore they even prefer to pay for an too high price. 
These researches have attempted to raise a neurological diagram of this kind of" game" with the help of experimental auction. 
A the group of volunteer played the lotto, while the other group participated in at a playful auction, hanging only with the help of a process of magnetic functional resonance( IRMf), the researcher analysed the cerebral active domain the experimental subject. 
In the two games, the participants were able to make of, but during the auction whose overbid of a third an essential element was, the set finding the cerebral trunk, called, started intensive movement of way at the time of the loss of the part. 
This part the brains, next to several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of" car" the nervous systems. 
That's why, according to the researchers, the climb the prices explains with the flight ahead the reaction assaults the striatum. 
In support of their theories, the members economist of this group of researcher have pursued the analyses of financial surveillance. 
At the time of this one, three groups outbid against a partner, in several circumstances. 
They have quite simply informed the group controls of the real value the products in 
At an other group, they have promised that if, on top of that, they were taking out winner of the part, then they would receive 15 additional dollars, in reward. 
While the third group have him received these 15 dollars before the bids, but the members the group equally lost this money, in case they lost the bids. 
The difference between these two groups was in fact that the accent was put in at one on the victory, while at the other, on the failure. 
While thus proving the hypothesis the neurologists, the members of the team the player" against the failure" were willing the the stakes more high than this made test and groups "for the victory". 
"These results can be demonstrated by no economic already existing theory by. 
Indeed, everybody of they explained the phenomena noted at the time of auction what by the pleasure in to win and the parade front risks. 
Lonely the methods of neurological imagerie have helped to delete the contradiction between the two theories while leading, now, to a third explanation." -- Has noted Andrew Schotter, the professor of the faculty the economics of the university of N.Y. 
The hepatitis: When must we consult a physician? 
In the world, about a halves billion of person suffer of hepatitis B or C chronicle, while in Hungary, the chronic disease the livers was mentioned among the first causes of decease. 
One estimates at hundred the sick persons carrier the viruses of the hepatitis in Hungary, but lonely seven are following a treatment. That was the by the way that often the sick persons do not know that they were carrier the viruses. 
The appellation eastern hepatitis one generic given name in order the infections concerning the liver and caused. 
Il y a much of similarity between their symptoms. Were characteristic, but the pathogenic agents and the illnesses generated put off one the other. 
The viruses of the hepatitis, according to the pathogenic genes, mainly spread under two forms: The hepatitis A and E across the alimentary canal (for example: Food or water infected), the hepatitis B, C, D and the other viruses by the blood and the organic liquids( sperm vaginal, secretion, saliva). 
. 
The symptoms of the hepatitis A seem two at three week after the consumption of infected food, generally, accompanied by a bad general state, of weakness, of pain of stomach and of nausea. 
Then maturates on the skin and on the white of the eye one visible jaundice, the saddles grow more clear and the urine takes a more dark colour. The recovery can take two at three weeks. 
Across the world, each year, a million of person die of the form the more grave of this pathology, like the cancer or the cirrhosis caused by the hepatitis. 
The main causes in east which the the appraisals, lonely a sick person on ten receives a medical treatment. 
The hepatitis C can equally have the serious consequences: If she is not treated, she can lead to a cirrhosis or a cancer the liver. 
The plupart the sick person does not know suffering from the viruses, because the pathogenic gene destroys of sly way the cells the livers. In many of case, the first symptoms appear only after 20 at 30 years. 
Par conséquent, a precocious prevention was very important, as well as the screening regular tests. 
The eastern contamination much more high than the average among a population of three groups: The persons having undergone a front bloodtransfusion 1991, the drug users and the tattooed. 
Currently, one assesses at 200 million the sick persons suffering from a chronic hepatitis of type C in the world. 
Since the illness can be detected by an exam in laboratory, he is recommended to consult his physician calling from the observation of symptom of unknown origin. 
The illness can be cured, if she is detected in time. Am the virus can be eradicated of the body, of this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of a cancer am warned. 
The 30 Sep was the day world-wide of the hepatitis first time in 2004 by the bodies representing the sick persons, organized for the the four corners the worlds. 
His objective was to attract the attention on the cirrhosis chronicle, caused, on the causes of his development and on the importance the precocious diagnosis of the illness. 
Do in god this who grows feel less the pain? 
According to the results of a recent research, the religious belief would function as one is getting out of analgesic, who would have already helped to make more bearable the death the catholic agonies. 
The daily British Telegraph has published an article have achieved an interesting experience in analyzing at the belief in god was able to influence the tolerance at the pain of the human-being. 
Within the context of of has been submissive the the shock therapy, while everybody of them watched a painting marries the virgin marries the virgin. 
According to the results, the catholic believers have been capable of excluding a big part of the suffering. 
Thanks to a technique of palpation the brains human, one has been able also to discover what what the Catholics have been capable of activating the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of the pain. 
This analysis was the première of a series of experience, which the academicians, the scientists, the the philosopher and the theologians participate in from various sector of the university. 
More precisely, the experience occurs of the next way: An instrument issuing the sparks and disseminating the shock therapies is fixed on the left hand the experimental subject. 
The researchers have asked the participants of the experience to look at of steady way two paintings, being the peinte virgin Marie by Sassoferrato the 17ème centuries and the other, one packs at the peinte ermine by Léonard of Vinci the 15ème centuries. 
The researchers at the source of this experience hoped that the sight of the virgin Marie recalls a kind of state of faith among the believers, while the choice of the painting of Da Vinci, step very various of the première, concerned on his soothing effect. 
The experimental subjects have passed an half hour in a scanner IRM, and for this time, have received 20 shock therapies in four part this at more general theme, while either looking at the painting at religious theme, was this at more general theme. 
The Catholics have announced only to the sight of the virgin Marie, they felt like" safely", like someone whose one" takes care" and they have" calmed down, and the peace has invaded them". 
At the sight of the painting of religious set of themes, they have given back count of 12% of pain in less than when they looked at the work of Léonard. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, himself participated in at the experience, think that one can reach the same effects with. 
"We would have to find a picture against they very positively react, like for example a mother otherwise one father", has announced the psychologist. 
Tom Wright Anglican, bishop, has greeted the results of these researches. 
"The practice of the faith would have to change and in many of case, actually changes our personality", has added Wright. 
After these excellent results, it stays more than the matter of knowledge am the effect on the regulation of the pain the subject so one watch the believer one Madone peinte by Léonard otherwise by a painter the even grade? 
Would the sight of one virgin Marie of good quality provoke of good result? 
You were this which you disclose at your subject 
Sometimes of his anniversaire dixième, Google claims that one can find him in the depths of the pocket the people the same titles only the sky the top of their head. He knows where they have passed their holidays, what specialists they do consult and am their centers of interest. 
This was yet not still enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who am a the influential person of the society. 
While with respect to the sceptics establishing a parallel with the sight of horror of Orwell, this one do rightly not see the essential the webs 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt has declared, few ago, the Financial Times which which the main ambition of Google was to gather still more of information on his user. This was necessary so that the founding of Google were able to respect their initial objective who rang comme suit: "Collect in a system all the information the worlds!". 
According to the leader of Google questioned, after ten years of a world-wide work of chaos, they were always of their objectives to be able to treat all the information. 
At the question: What will he have there in five years? Schmidt has answered that he would like that Google was able to tell the the questions as or" what would be able to make tomorrow?"" am the work who the better would be leaving?". However, the software will be able to answer at this kind of question, simple at vue première, that the day where they will know him enough on the users. 
It was not perfectly clear for all the internet surfers that the used words the the researches on, the address IP of the computer who spear seeks her and the page consulted then by the interested persons am precisely listed. 
By the intermediary the program Personalized Search thrown two years ago, the users can, for example, to stock their own historical of research and can to consult this they looked, they clicked. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommandations, program basing the even logical, being in a position to to give the much more customized answers, and will subject to us the product and the services on basis of our previous statements and of our preferences recorded. 
What is he arriving if someone uses my data against me, what if he looks am my work? Ask the users, who worry seeing the monopoly of information of Google. 
In most the cases, this was the potential power represented, and this was not the remord, the fear of the punishment, the desire of freedom or possibly the revolt against the power who can arouse at the internet surfers one counter. 
This was however a confirmed fact that the sought-after terms are not only recorded, but the the justified cases, they are transmitted to at a third, and in this kind of legal case, nothing protects the personal rights from the internet surfers. 
The example the more resounding of lately was probably the coordinated action the the Brazilian paedophile, Google have transmis the Brazilian governments the information that he had harvested on the public page conscript Orkut, thus allowing an identification. 
The internet surfers worried about the right of the person has been able to give a sigh in last May, when Google, above underneath with the body of legal protection electronics EFF, arm has proven his good right to the courts the FBI. According to the rendu judgment, in the future, Google will always be able to be not forced by none the point of the constitution by to disclose the information on the secret demand for the FBI that this am. 
(Simultaneously, the federal government has gotten successfully some 50.000 send web and 1.000 term, voted previously. But in the end, he does not succeed in providing the lists the researches the private user, neither the whole list the website and the keywords of these two last months.) 
The judgment of Google was thus enough contradictory: He is denounced by this who fear the transmission of their personal data by, because they think that their sphere and summons their private domain suffer him when they are beginning to use the services Google. Therefore, they attack them in the mind of revolt which one shows against the multinational societies proud of their conservative picture. 
In the meantime, the geek American culture and his" sauvageons" gathering the passionate, the activists and the enthusiastic users of the computer who appear in of numerous country see Google the next generation the big enterprises, the trendy" guild", per opposition at his rival, Microsoft, catalogued like invader because of Windows, and this, even if all both beat la même objective. 
That can explain by the fact that Google, contrary to Microsoft, does not ask to his users of code of identification, does not ask of his applications. The documentary code and the packet of program, continuously cooled, have an effect much more accessible, plus more cool young and, against the practice the giant official the software. 
The reason can as be that the geeks very exactly see the problematic relation between the rights of the person and internet, and this only the web 2.0, the word key most proclaimed of these last year, tire precisely behind him. 
Indeed, the web 2.0 does not concern something else only the collaboration, only the fact that we intentionally leave the traces behind we, and only we serve the dressed channels of communication at our arrangement, and while the dimension of this one changes a by a, the essential remains le même: One displays. 
An young, generally, can hold a profile on several public pages, of Facebook at Xanga, and he can to even link this one to at others benefits, like per example at Twinter, or at last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then, he can link this one to a system of pursuit, like FriendFeed otherwise Blip.fm. These young can as hold the blogs, in which their more recent galleries of photo which they stock on Flickr otherwise on Picasa do automatically appear. 
While one can take knowledge of numerous example, like this of the girlfriend who the morning consists of easily at the sight the photos, hold by the circle this of the society who who an of his employees has bachelor, nothing only for the sincere opinions that this one written on his blog by the way the top management, one can be on of a thing: The term of private life totally am to reconsider nowadays. 
This an online life lives, is constituted of this which he shows of himself, and this. 
This wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to bypass the monopoly of Google, can make him( in starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the system of research Google, but, at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace). 
The number of person not check in the the public page so that it was not possible to find them, number'was lesser step the. The services of online Google, in going from the word processor to the treatments of picture, at the reading of information can be replaced and who the the alternative versions, are not attached to at of enormous park of waiter who do not gather our good profile, having existed until to date. 
The public opinion waits, without really to hide, the time where Google will unveil his real nature. 
Worth more than IBM( 140 billion of dollar), Intel( 124 billion of dollar) or Coca-Cola( 110 billion of dollar). The domains advertising AdWords/ AdSense threaten the figure of matter the advertising agency, while the benefits cause of serious headache not only Microsoft at an more and more important speed, but at of numerous other creator of computer program. 
However, the critical observers find, next to this, the contradictions the effect worrying: For example, the top management of the society refused, in his entièreté, the protests the employee, after only she double the price of the motherly of and after only the society judged too costly the multiple daily restoration, hold matters. This seem pathetic next door because already in 2006, Google has agreed in front of the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the society detect all the results who hurt the good tastefullness, as the interests the Chinese diet. 
According to a the internal periods of the society, the new services are not announced only when they can be used. Are going make to move the world on of new point. While some think only the plan of scan and of filing of book and of magazine of Google takes the so important dimensions the society is going under few to meet against the supreme yard the U.S, others are trembling in front of sound system Health, bus in this one, one can build a medical complete profit to leave from our anterior results of analysis, our physicians and our problems. 
The fact that Google is mounting a basis of genetic data can give a good rawmaterial the next generation of author of sciencefiction. The novel the famous Cory Doctorow written, work the the orwelliens semitone, describes the future in which a man would be able to be approached of effarante way nothing only across the data of Google.

Ludwik Sobolewski, of Warsaw, the president of the grant the values has confirmed this proposal that the Polish have made despite that, previously, the Czech have excluded the stockmarket of Warsaw from the circle the new potential owner of the stockmarket of.

The financial crisis the viewpoints of the European press 
In their established comments the Tuesdays at the financial international crisis, getting worse day by day, the newspapers leader of the European press recall already second one" 11 Sep ". 
"The financial overall catastrophe, one owes her to the American presidents" -- accuses the daily of Rome, the Repubblica." The president has even not been capable of doing block with his own party behind a proposal aiming to carry help at an appalling situation..." 
Instead of a news Pearl Harbour, as the multimillionaire Warren Buffett recalled him, it was more appropriate of second parler of a 11 Sep. 
A part of the madrilène press equally sees the scapegoat in Washington. 
According to the sight the daily El Mundo, this were the breaches of the political direction of there who the world-wide economy has brought to on the verge of the collapse. 
The danger of the collapse the financial American systems himself accroit each day, and afterwards, the whole world is going to pay for the price he well. 
The plan of Bush was far from to be perfect, however according to the vote the congress, a real danger threatens, this which Washington does not propose of political tool in order to treat the crisis. 
The world-wide economy hangs in the emptiness, exactly the times where in the story the capitalism, a the more big change takes place. 
One can ignore the threat more a long time-- underline the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva. 
Some states can still hold out a lifebelt to their financial staggering bodies, and thanks to the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from the bankruptcy. 
Of course, if still more of bank are collapsing such the domino, then neither the financial mean, of new improvisation neither will be sufficient. 
In the long term, we need that the states of the European Union make few case of their national selfishness, and that they centralise the test the financial divided market. 
Nothing what Monday, the financial weak bodies received no longer of 100 billion of euro -- has called again the Viennese daily, Der Standard, who adds that the fears according to which according to which the European taxpayers also are going to have to put on the hand at the poach, very deep, of way similar the American in the aim of to remedy at the crisis, become more and more realist. 
So far, the EU has not really handled the crisis, who, like a tsunami, sleeper, right through, the old continent. 
The" rescuers" must not brandish at once hundred billion of euro, on the other hand this would be judicious if they recorded what case it would be in rational of touch at the money the taxpayer, with the objective to warn of more big damage. 
The clever automobile imitates the flight the drone 
What method would be good in order to develop the technologies capable to avoid an obstacle, if this was the imitation of an existing detector of obstacle already in the nature? 
Like per example, this the bee. 
In the surprising reported plan the CEATEC, taking place the Japan, the buzzing bees have given the strategic idea of start the engineer of at Nissan, in order to inspire them on they must conceive of the next generation of detector of obstacle. 
In collaboration with the university of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini car robot, an inspired system at auto-robotisé order, of type BR23C, which he has equipped the qualities the bee, the final objective up to scratch stakes of a system capable of avoiding all the obstacles to encourage up to scratch stakes of a system capable of avoiding all the obstacles to encourage. 
At the time of his flights, each bee constitutes his own space, of oval form, who in reality, of protection secured-- has explained, at the time of the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the department head the research and development and technological publicrelations of the mark. much looks like our shell 
The eye at facet of the bee plays a crucial role, since it was capable of seeing all the directions, in an angle of 300 degrees. 
In order to imitate the functions of the eye at facet, the engineers have reached the idea the rangefinders at laser. 
This one identifies the obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, he evaluates the distances and sends a signal the microprocessors of edge, who does turn into manoeuvre of avoidance at once. 
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a split second. Then, the mini car robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately change the direction of his wheel into the turning-point of an angle sufficient in order to avoid the crash. 
Contrary to all existing system currently, this manoeuvre of avoidance completely occurs of instinctive way. 
"If it was not thus, the mini car robot would be able to not react enough quickly in order to avoid the obstacle" -- explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director the laboratory Mobilité and the plan robotisée car. 
She must react of way instinctive and instantaneous, since this technology corresponds to the coat the more vulnerable and the more internal of the envelope of protection, a coat where as of now the crash is considered inevitable. 
All this process must reflect this which the bee makes in order to avoid the other bees. 
The process must occur in the twinkling of an eye. 
At the opposite the bee, the difference can not go vers le haut, towards the bottom or in diagonal, she can be only of two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn. 
Of this way, the infinite combinations which the bees own in order to avoid the other bees, in our case, one has been able to use only the rotary movement, the acceleration as well as the slowdown like manoeuvre at the arrangement of the mini car robot 
The BR23C uses the batteries Lithium polymère who were more light and whose the concentrated of energy was more big, this who their life span in the version Lithium-ion gives back. 
According to Andoh, this was the clever instinctive reaction who the ability to stock was crucial, not the data-processing, et encore moins. 
This mechanism must treat only some entrants signals per second, and to react to this one. 
It was not necessary to stock them and to react with the intuitive logic basing the data the anterior maneuvers. Of this way, he uses only some dozens of kilobyte of memory in continuous. 
One does not need of memory of an ability of gigabyte, neither even of méga-octets. 
This was the first step towards the conception of an instantaneous technology being useful for the avoidance. According to the appraisals of Nissan, this system will make his entry in the cars made serial in the ten next years. 
An other application would be able to be his incorporation in the system of navigation per satellite GPS, so that he was able to guide the driver towards his destination while avoiding the obstacles finding his way. 
One has even given a name the hors de prix babies 
The written version the plan of rescue economic of 700 billion of dollar, being ready to buy back the dubious credits to use in several faiths,. 
The first turns, is going the half of this sum to be spent. 
Reuters announces only during new debate going on until after midnight, Saturday, local time of the eastern coast, the ruling the congress have fallen in agreement into the controversies existing the the day and the day, the plan of rescue of a total amount of 700 billion of dollar. 
"We have made a seriousness not forwards" -- has announced Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the American room the Rep., of afterwards which which does it remain to put on the agreements about paper. 
The compromise, born the plan, is supported by the two candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain by. 
The American secretary the treasure, Henry Paulson, has announced in commenting on the results the compromise that is going the program to function and, however others measures must still be implementation. According to Pelosi, it was not matter, here, of the rescues of Wall Street make to turn the cogwheels of the economy dans l'autre sens 
The written version the plan has been made public before the opening the Asiatic markets h, Sunday evening in order 20 local, time of Washington (this est-à-dire h Monday at 2 the mornings, according to the local time of central Europe), has not provoked of spectacular climb in the grants. 
Monday, the room the Rep. will be the première to vote the economic proposal of. Then, his fate will be between the hands the senate. 
Saturday evening, the President George Bush has talked to Pelosi, then, the White House has equally greeted the news of the agreement. 
"We were satisfied with the advanced this night, and we value strongly the efforts the two gone in order to stabilise our markets financier and pro to protect our economy" -- has announced Tony Fratto, the spokesman of the White House. 
Moreover, the program diverges from the initial made proposal by the administration Bush, who she, mentioned that the 700 billion of dollar had to be spent in only once, for the structural repurchase the titles the the dubious credit. 
Henceforth, maximum the half of the sum of 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be rescued from immediately after the adoption by the congress by the law, probably Monday. This first sum will serve the secretaries the treasure in order to buy the bad debts the banks, while the use the 100 billion of additional dollar will be left at the discretion the presidents. 
The program will be supervised by an independent body, in which the president of the reserve Fédérale will participate in also. by 
The expense of the second half the 700 billion depends on a new decree the congress. 
The term of the law, the secretariat the treasure will be able to put in place a strategy combined: He will be able, simultaneously, to buy the bad debts, the the titles concerning the the mortgages and the dubious mortgages, thus only of other type of toxic debt"". 
The competent persons the ministries have declared that the repurchases can take place within the context of an auction, but as directly. 
The rule gives the possibility the concernées society to participate in at a program of where the secretariat the treasure guaranteed the tools the anxieties, for which will the enterprises have paid an equivalent premium to the foreseeable harm. 
Henry Paulson has declared that the law provided the tools necessary so that to devote 700 billion of dollar for the dubious needs urgent the systems, that it was a matter the large repurchase for the debts, of, or of to avoid the risk to see the entrainant system the collapse of a or the other financial important institution. 
"Are going we to take the necessary arrangements, in order to be ready at the application of the law, as soon as it will be signed" -- he has added. 
En revanche, the leaders the banks finding bad position and expecting the help from the state can expect this only their severance pay, called simply airdrop gilded across the Atlantic, will be reached ceiling by the government by. 
The ceiling the salary was mentioned only the the cases precise good. In addition, the limitations depend on the way whose whose the secretariat the treasure proposes his help at the enterprise. 
The principle the ceilings means that if the secretariat the treasure buys back in the frame of an auction, they will take an overplus of tax on the golden handshake, unless preside of bank discredited am leaving for the retirement. 
Directly after the repurchase the bad debts, the government will intervene in aggressive way in order to check that the versed amount the leader was not exaggerated. 
So that the picture was complete, all the same necessary to add that the golden existing handshakes are not changed it. The ceiling concerns only the new contracts, this in order to justify thus the participation the plan. 
This was the first time in the story the U.S that the legal ceilings will be in concerning the salaries the general directors-- has commented on the president of the commission in charge of financial benefits of the Chambre the Députés, the democrat Barney Frank. 
In addition, the state provides a right of acquisition of part in the banks participating in the plan. Of this way, the risk the taxpayer diminishes, since they can even be winner in the matter from only the economy and with she the bank fall again on their foot will fall again on their foot. 
The bill mentions, the president must introduce the congress a proposal who will rule on the way are going the loss to be returned to the 
The 
This was not for that the American citizens have appointed us, this does not protect the dollar from the taxpayer-- has announced the deputy republican of California, Darrell Issa. 
His democratic colleague of the Ohio, Mary Kaptur thinks that this were les mêmes who the busy the measure senses, que this official of the collapse of Wall Street.

The linguistic review of the press German 
The right-wing camp was intact, this was only the parties that the voters have grown more aware -- this am as well as recalls the Der Spiegel, the weak score the CSU in the Bavarian country. 
Haider was ready, in order to prevent the coalition the red and black. 
Der Spiegel( spiegel.de) 
In the publishing internet the German magazines of left-wing information, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat the CSU in his article entitled" the revolution in Bavaria consumes his fathers". 
According to this political recognized analyst, the erosion the CSU has taken up bien before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber takes his functions. 
The Christian socialists have transformed the Bavaria the the decade and now, this were these same modern citizens who are turning the back. 
This change of time was simultaneously the problem of all the Christian democracy, and of this fact, also this of Angela Merker. 
For the CSU, the failure has not been quite a surprise but Sunday,, has arrived at term one process who was likely he there of year, all exactly ten: The indisputable hegemony the national parties has drawn to the closes. 
Of ago ten years, in 1998, the CSU picked up with 47,7 per cent, and this for the first time for years, with a score the levels of the 50 per cent. 
That has repeated three years ago the election the Bundestag of 2005, that is to say at the time the tellement recalled. 
The cause can be attributed to at the modernization" consuming his parents", stake puts him in the solid area of way by the CSU. 
That makes 40 years that the sociologists announce that but they have strongly made mistake concerning the rhythm. However the sécularisation, the results of the education and the establishment of German the north and of the east in the area of Bavaria, in lots of development, were able to not stay without consequence on the faithfulness the voters CSU. 
A modernization is pari passu going with the increase the opportunities, and the consequences of a such policy were equally visible. 
The right-wing camp was intact, this was only the parties that the voters have grown more aware, more criticise and pleased stubborn. 
It was surprising equally only during these last weeks, this was precisely the groups of classic citizen who the craftsmen have rather gone away from the CSU, such than the independents,, the holders the ferries and the graduating from study superior. 
In these groups, the support the CSU has fallen below 40 per cent. 
Die Presse( diepresse.com) 
In his article entitled "Qui? With who? Preside of party hold on on the reserve the matters of the coalition", the Austrian conservative daily handles the situation of. 
The Austrian socialists the SPÖ want to talk about the conservatives to the ÖVP. 
The ÖVP forbids the SPÖ to join his internal matters. 
The party populist BZÖ proves open the the negotiation. The greens do not want still to put of agreement about the coalition. 
The elections have taken place The organized debate at the television public, the ruling of gone to hardly let to make their cards out. 
Werner Faymann, the president the SPÖ, has confirmed that he wanted to talk about the ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to show that the collaboration the two parties was actually possible-- this was this who exists already in some areas and in the socialist partnership. 
The question according to which he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, of the ÖVP, like vice, the current president stays open on behalf of Faymann. 
As he has mentioned him, the orientation Schüssel-Molterer has been rejected, at any rate,. 
An answer of this combination was out of of question. 
Molterer has reacted with caution to the proposals the reds. 
As he has already said him, a collaboration will safely be fruitless if Faymann attempts to interfere with the matter intern of the ÖVP. 
In his party, the choice of the opposition or of the entry in the coalition was momentarily an quite open question. These points must absolutely be discussed within the ÖVP. 
Jörg Haider, the president the BZÖ, again proves open to all proposals. 
"In order to avoid the coalition the red and black, we were ready" -- has announced Haider. 
Járóka has declared: Necessary to break the vicious circle of the poverty and of the segregation it 
Today, has started, at bet, the European top for the equality the chance, whose France the host was, like Rep. of the current presidency of the European Union. 
In his message exposed in front of the plenary gathering, as a the door main of the consultation of expert, Lívia Járóka, eurodéputée Fidesz gone Populaire European, attracted the attention on the segregations in the education, then this am a violation roms and thereby, a the main brake at their success in the life. 
On behalf of the presidency French, this conference of high level has been opened on the one hand, by Xavier Bertrand French, minister the Travail and the matters Sociales, and of somewhere else, by Vladimir Spidla European, commissioner laden with the works, the the social matters and of the opportunity by. 
Among the invitées persons to participate in at the consultation, one finds the social partners European, as well as the more distinguished representatives of the legal protection and the civilian European bodies, in the domain of the opportunity. 
According to the office of press the group the deputy Fidesz gone Populaire, Járóka has warned that next door the distinctions noted the hiring, the roms vanish from the labourmarket following their weakling qualification. 
"A crushing majority of young roms do not own of diploma of secondary, and en conséquence an elementary education of shoddy quality, lonely a tiny part has the possibility to elicit a diploma from superior study." 
Moreover, Járóka has insisted on the fact that the education like elementary right of the human-being plays a role key when one must make worth the other fundamental laws. 
The investment in the precocious education the children roms means a reinforcement of the economy the membercountry Européenne. 
According to the eurodéputée, it was necessary make to take awareness of these reports in a circle the more wide possible, also am entering the roms and the nos. 
Indeed, early a child rom take up the school, more he increases his chances to become a productive member the labourmarket; By the paid taxes to leave of his income and of his consumption, he partakes the budget of the state. 
"In their nationality of the European Union, the roms must be assured of of their right to an education of quality, and to be protected of an education of weak sectarian quality and." -- Has underlined Lívia Járóka. 
According to the deputy, a collaboration of the European oriented Union towards an objective and a action was necessary for an immediate acceleration the processes of desegregation the schools. For, the respect the existing directive of discrimination and in preparation was of a crucial importance. 
"Necessary to break the vicious circle of the poverty, of the segregation and the joblesses. it Necessary to give the assured possibilities by the democracy the children it roms, so that they were able to partake like citizen de plein droit in future of the Europe"-- has required Járóka. 
On behalf of the European assured" year for the opportunity" for all, the objective the organized top for the opportunity in Europe each year since the top in Berlin the last year, east of to provide one sole platform in order to support the measures busy for of the equality the chance and in order the struggle against the discrimination, aimed the the European levels and the levels of the membercountry. 
CSU: The grace for a period 
This was in October what what the decision concerning will be hold 
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not still fallen, and the debate about the personal questions the top the Bavarian CSU has been postponed. 
The president the parties, Erwin Hube and the leader the regional governments, Günther Beckstein, can still maintain their place. Be the question to know when the grace will last until? 
Is taking him out the tandem, having undergone a loss of catastrophic voice of 17 per cent, will be at the agenda the congress, held the last weekend. 
The members of this pair very criticised, at any rate, made to feel that they did not care especially about their seat. 
Thanks to that, they has devoted to appease the members furious of the fraction and of the basis, who one day after the Bavarian" tsunami" have required from the personal consequence in order the loss of the absolute majority. 
It has there of five years -- this was true, still under supervision, the top of his career-- the Christian union won 60,7 per cent, while today, an year afterwards the putsch counters Stoiber, has only 43,4 per cent of their strength it. 
For 46 years, the CSU has been the" sole sovereign" of the donnant Bavaria 18 per cent the German PIB. 
But, the conservatives always count strongly in this area the south, of importance key for the Hungarian economy. In future, they will be coerced into at the coalition. 
Like a the first sign of an internal reorganisation the parties, the vice president and the federal reported minister of the agriculture, Horst Seehofer, like the received successor possible of Huber, equally one puts in this modest group of gratefulness, who does learn the discussions gropingly with the liberals the FDP, thus only with the voters Libres, formed the values right-wing, about a possible coalition the governments of Munich. 
A strange pied de nez the fate has been only with the help of the list the voters Libres, am entering in the legislation the Gabriele Pauli, of the hold has served scope for putsch perpetrated, in order then to treat without the very ambitious political municipal woman. 
Now, the leaders the CSU set all their energy to stabilise, somehow, Beckstein. 
In this transition, Stoiber, who up to now pulled the strings behind scene, will equally receive an active role. The regional government and president the CSU, the former leader has designated the 28 Sep like the day the more bitter of his political career. 
Monday, Huber has thrown some caustic remarks towards the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more of support the gone brother. 
Others politicians CSU have interpreted the defeat like an advance notice for the CDU and equally for Angela Merkel. 
The election Bundestag, will take place, Merkel will be able again be chancellor only if they put back to foot of a way or of an other, with a common strength, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005. 
According to Merkel, with difficulty hiding his disappointment caused, the loss of ground the CSU will not influence of negative way the big coalition of Berlin. 
This who was yet relative for it will not be more easy to manage the injured CSU, and the hard crisis the democrat always. 
Since 1946, the SPD has reached his more bad results with 18,6 per cent in Bavaria. 
Lukasenko-- his rivals: 110 -- 0 
No deputy of the opposition has reached for the Belarusian parliament after the elections of Sunday. 
According to the Russian observers, that explains who by a country dirigé by Alexandre Lukashenko, ensures him prosperity and stability, while according to the organisation for the security and the Coopération in Europe (OSCE), that if explains the the illegality committed the spareness the votes. 
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers of 43 countries, does not recognise the elections. 
Well only the legislature compound of 110 persons in this country of 10 million of inhabitant very well dispenses with opposition since of long decade, before the elections of, the opposition uniting his strengths under the name of Forces Démocratiques Unies( ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his mandate of president for the fourth time at the time of dubious election, on the traces of the modification," would allow "this time the presence of some deputies of the opposition the parliament. 
Of this way, the ODSZ has given his up boycott foreseen originally. 
The fact what which the Belarus, economically depending more and more on the Russia, would like to improve his reports with the EU, where do because of the political Belarusian qualified order of undemocratic, Lukashenko and several top-ranking politicians not receive of visa from entry, was one the wait of the opposition. The Belarus has the to contribute thus on the way of the society Beltransgaz a credit because of the reduction the imports of natural Russian gas, always more dear, and, owner the pipe of gas crossing the country past, east the hand the Russians. 
The fact that the OSCE, at the time of the evaluation of the country, has put the accent on the positive changes rather in only the the breaches, like for example the ban on to turn up for a third the candidates at the opposition, made reference to a preliminary appeasement. 
However, the communiqué of the OSCE of Monday contested already the country, during which the essential the candidates at the opposition was able to not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition the opposition was able the opposition to not be present the spareness the vote. 
Despite this, the opposition all the same feels a tangible improvement in the political system: Minsk the political prisoners have found the freedom, and Minsk was ready at of small confrontation with Moscow, always in refusing to recognise the Ossétie the south and the Abazzia separate of the Ga. Gold, the Russia with who the Belarus forms a confederation on paper, considers the two territories independent ever since already a month. 
"We have made two not forwards, and a step in back, but the more important was only the dialogue has been baited between the Belarus and the EU" -- has announced Alexandre Milinkevitch to our newspaper. 
According to the candidate at the opposition the presidential election of 2006, it was desirable that that thus stays, despite only" the power has had fear in this parliament no weight make to go in for even a lonely opponent 
The opposition does not foresee of action of protest the results. She essaye make to reach his message on the necessity of economic reform the voters. 
"Of course, we have many of worry of: We must make to print our opposing newspapers in Russia, the local authorities put the sticks in the wheels as for the diffusion, but I can notice as that they were more and more at to support the elections, even in the circle the senior citizen" -- has announced Milinkevitch, making reference to the fact that in the current diet Lukashenko, who consider the social insurance like his main result, does lay down the most steady pensioners officially consider more really like appropriate. 
"Because of the indebtedness the and of the rise the trade deficits, the collapse of the social insurance,'recalling of a cemetery', the silence was more only a matter of time" -- estimate Milinkevitch. 
The politicians of the opposition, the Russian observers have described the elections of democratic. 
Serguei Lebedev, running the mission of the community the states Indépendants, has announced to the Russian pressagency Ria Novosti: "The people do not hold belief the the words, but the the action.". Of this way, the absence of the opposition was only the proof of the maturity the Belarusian voters.

At the time of a conference at the superior public school of the administration 
Of Rome, the minister communicates what "in three months, the absences of illness the public employee have reduced of 50%, either 60 thousand workers in addition in an year". 
And he adds that it was essential to make more effective, the administration Publique. 
Italian ," of the dynamics salary-- explains the minister-- these 8-10 last year has doubled the private-sector, and good exaggerates the rates. 
The same times, the thousand of public employee, have united in order to contest the standards the decree Brunetta making appeal the Codacons. 
""While the minister of the civil service spreads out today the data concerning the decline in the absenteeism on the workplace the people the "active loafer" continues to increase. 
In effect, in Italy, the thousand of employee of the administration Publique correct and productive, have met in order to announce the war to the illegitimate standard restrained in the decree. 
In particular, the Tar, one contests the exclusion of additional allowance in the event of infirmity pour cause service; The extension the schedule the schedule of domiciliaire permanence the hard-working sick, lasting which the visits of test are carried out, thus only of other aspect restrained in the new intentional arrangement by the minister. 
Accident on the workplace Crucial" prevention" 
Each day, in Italy, one counts 2.500 accidents, 3 deaths and 27 persons who who remain invalid of permanent way. 
In 2007, the data Inail confirm indeed, that the white deaths have been about 1.200. 
The figures who the main causes of decease show of the gravity the phenomenon who a remains, and provokes almost two times more of decease only the homicides. 
In order to have the attention the the institution, the social strengths and the mean of information on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil celebrates today, in all the Italian provinces, the 58ème national day the victims of accident on the work, institutionalized. 
"The worrying data disseminated say the president of the republic, Giorgio Napolitano, at the time of an envoyé message to the presidents of the Anmil national, association the mutilés and invalid the works, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head-of-state expresses his "sincere estimation for the continuous associative effort for the prevention on the workplaces, the protection the damaged worker, the audience the families the victims and the consciousness raising of the public opinion" 
"Naturally indignant, everybody has hit the fist in order to put a term in of such tragedy who, in their dimension, the arouse the clamour media and the participation of the public opinion, even if the daily reality introduces to us the dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics. 
Napolitano does not hide only" ago certainly a problem of resource: It was essential to invest in the formation and the information " 
In the sector school, the numerous promues initiatives assume a all particular importance for a more direct awareness the young who are entering. 
It was of our duty, to maintain the attention towards this phenomenon, ne not under to evaluate the alarm on the social gravity, to apply and to improve the legislative standards. 
Of, the president of the room Gianfranco Fini has underlined the how much "this phenomenon the white death constitutes a social absolute urgency, who the awareness of everybody of we insults, and impose on all the institution, of faire one concrete effort aiming to put there finely quickly". 
The data the casualties on the work seem to report a light proneness positive, but that prevents not only the numbers of white eastern death all the same impressing" has underlined subsequently the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We do not wish that this" proneness to the discount" in fact translates, in a minor attention, for this was precisely the attention relaxes, what the tragedy is managing. 
"We believe only in general, one does not make enough in order to contrast the phenomenon the accidents and the contrast can be made thanks to of multiple action." 
« According to we-- have underlined Mercandelli-- more of test and of inspection were necessary, just like an more important intervention on the formation the worker, and this, from the school. " 
-- He has added --" that necessary to make still an effort with respect to the communication it and the consciousness raising of the public opinion. 
"But above all necessary, a more big sense employer face in order one phenomenon who a social urgency represent. it" 
« Mercandelli has then denounced" the progressive deterioration the condition of safeguard of the expected allowance for the victims the works" and the "d'assistance drift towards which the system directs these last years". 
« The objective thus, was to give back to the worker the guarantee of he added -- so that the fate of this who an accident has, ne must to not depend the the spontanéisme or of the widening the legislator " 
Reader Mp3 pointed the finger, they put in risk the hearing. 
Such than the readers Mp3, can cause the permanent lesions to the hearing. 
There this which the Commission européenne announces, who, in a communiqué disseminated in Brussels, quote the opinion the scientific board, on the unexpected risks health and recently identified (Csrseri) of the EU, published today. 
"Of this scientific report-- read us in the note-- he spring which of this who, who, hanging a period of the minus 5 years, 5-10% listen to of the music at lots of volume using the musical portable devices, hanging more of an hour per day and per week, risk a permanent loss of the auditory ability. » 
"I was worried about the fact only one as important numbers of young who who the musical portable devices and the mobile phones at lots of volume frequently use, were able to damage unconsciously their hearing of irreparable way" assert Meglena Kuneva. 
""According to the scientific data-- pursues the official Ue-- it was a matter of a risk clear and we must react quickly. 
This who the more count was to make sensitive the consumers and. 
We must re-examine moreover, the existing systems of test considering the scientific opinion, so that they they were totally effective and" 
Brussels has asked to the scientific independent board to examine the problem considering the intensive use the musical portable device and the increase the numbers of young exposed the noises which this one generate. 
"The scientifiques-conclue the executive Ue -- confirm of good reason for worrying only ago, and that the Commission européenne will examine now with the memberstates and the other interested parts, what do sise would be able to be possibly adopted in order to better protect the children and the adolescents, against the exhibition the noises coming from musical portable device and similar device. 
It exists already an European standard of safety who the level of noise the musical portable device in order 100 restrict Db, but the anxiety increases the auditory harm who would be able to divert of an excessive exhibition in order of such source of noise. 
It was possible to well restrict these data making appeal the the solution like the reduction of the levels and of the duration of exhibition the noises. 
The board scientific Ue make to notice that the portable users of musical device, who listen in of the music at full volume (plus of 89 decibels) counterpart 5 hours per week, outpace the limits currently while vigour relative to the levels of maximum noise granted to the workplace. 
This who listen to of the music in of such prolonged condition the the periods, risk a permanent loss of the auditory ability after 5 year. 
That interests 5-10% the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified in the vicinity of 2,5 and 10 million of person in the U.E. 
Rome, Alemanno has given the order make to leave from the Commission for the future for the capital. 
Today we start, in March we end, in Jun we will pull the nap. 
There the set calendar by the Capitole for the works of the" commission for the future of Rome Capitale", who has taken place this morning, the new seats, behind the thermal baths of Caracalla. 
In six months, the president Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the commission will up to scratch put on the directives for Rome. 
In March when they finished, the Comité and the communal council will evaluate the analyses and the plans, so that to present in Jun, the strategic plan for Rome with the official" stamp" the Capitole and of his mayor Gianni Alemanno. 
""The commission was absolutely independent; All the ideas political, social and cultural are there represented -- keen to underline Alemanno -- she will have to propose the ideas of development of Rome whose political décisionnaires whose will be able to serve, who remain the Comité and the communal advice. 
No stacking of role, but exclusively the will to have a corner where to elaborate a big plan for Rome. 
In March, she will have finished his tasks and will disappear then, for this experience must a worldly duration specifies. 
In juin-annonce the mayor-- we will present the strategic plan born of the works achieved. " 
For this who accuse the commission of being useless, seeing that his opinions will be restrictive, Alemanno replies:" everything depends on the works which the commission will be capable of faire, thus only of the quality of his proposal. 
If the quality was there, like in France thanks to the commission Attali, as moreover in Rome, I am following him on, his contribution will be fundamental. 
Too often the policy is overwhelmed by the management the the daily and the urgency who demonstrate from time to time by. 
We, on the contrary, we want to show up of the front, and pleased far, towards a prospective more deep, seriously working for the developments of Rome and of his future. " 
Moreover, the mayor of Rome keen to underline what" this commission was not an useless body neither one bureaucratic set: It was absolutely free, and will not cost an euro the Roman town-dwellers, and will serve to study and make to participate in the top-of-the-line intelligence who express the capital. 
For Alemanno, indeed," necessary a strategic outline of reference it, neither firmly neither motionless, in order to allow to our city to improve this it needs absolutely, while thinking about his future now an unitary mind, ". 
A future who, the mayor of Rome specify," will not restrict the usual communales borders, who but will look further » not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and of his status legal of Capitale, but also the role only Rome can and must, as capital of the Europe and of the Mediterranean sea". 
Obama? The first American president. Voilà pourquoi. 
Famous political American one who keen to pass for independent, has written: "Barack Obama will be the second American president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, of part his decisions, destroyed the economy wore out and had the reports( as moreover he always today, as private citizen) with the hostile Islam. " 
The attacks on Obama increase while dates the elections to approach. 
A lady of Miami has written on a site web: "This person was full of ambition". 
Obama was really cheeky: He believes that he will earn the more high function of a nation who count all told, two governors and five black senators!" 
In effect, it was a matter of attack who do not say big thing; This were obviously the attacks of racial nature, and do not answer at the matter of all the voters: Will he be a good president? We moreover have the polls, who all do declare Obama will earn and with a voucher. 
In this case, it was still a matter of someone who speak with the heart and not with the brain. 
A newspaper the Mississipi, in the guts the south the U.S, has written an article: Once in the cabin of vote, we know good at who the American patriot will give his vote. 
There what what an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until in the end is emerging. 
"Say this which you want, we will see us even to put on the cross, on Obama otherwise on McCain. 
Il y a even the person who swear: If Obama is winning, we will leave from the state Unis. 
Thing never revealed until at now, at tel point the success the black candidate almost seem sure. 
De toute façon, despite all these reasoning, the card gagnante for the democrats was George Bush. 
One has asked to 1500 person: Been the mistakes committed during his mandate? 89 per cent has replied: The Iraq. 
The America changes. 
Has been the Vietnam, this nation has lost 50 thousand soldiers and were sent back to at she at kick the buttock. 
Have been in Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost the life, and the American have been not forced to make the cases. 
Despite, the Iraq has been, for the most part, the point of weakness of Bush. 
Who will take the place of George W will have an enormous spot to carry out. 
Wore out, the economic debacle make to feel even at the journalists: In the press, this was the hour the removal. And many accuse internet, this "murder" the paper newspaper. 
Five hundred American journalists have been called out out by the PEW Research Center by the way the status of their profession and mental test for the future by. 
And all the journalists well, almost were today pessimistic as for their future. 
However, they has not declared openly the attaché of the information, himself to feel less worried about the credibility. 
They do not feel isolated like once. 
The the money problem the American journalists, this was the money,. 
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists was a crisis of economic détruit model. 
In goatskin, the removals made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work for the assembling the newspapers, were a big problem. 
This was a problem who must be determined, according to the journalists interviewed, if one wishes that the usual journalism such than the generalpublic hears him, amounts de façon consistent. 
An obvious but complex pessimism invades the American journalism. 
Six on ten executive seniors and journalist of newspaper of printing house are convinced that the journalism the national levels am in the process of to follow a bad way. 
Locally, the executive group am at 65%. 
Printed publication counters broadcast. 
The journalists do not have of pain to see that the web is going. 
The more big houses publisher are cutting a passage towards internet, perceived like" the murderer "the paper newspaper. 
The economic" pressure" which the journalists feel is increased until at 79%. 
The 500 journalists admitted to make something voucher at the technology hoping for only her"" for their journalism. 
Today, the American tear the more big in the journalism resides between who are heading the newsrooms-- that is to say the directors-- and the reporters who work for them. 
56% the directors the national levels, are convinced that the reporters share their values, then only the local levels, this percentage is going down at 23%. 
For some, that was connected to the" safety the works". 
The directors who who think to lose their job of work in the space of 3 years, were of 47% the national level. 
With respect to the journalists, one is going to 30%. 
This the sure" work" at the level of staff( our editors, ndr) in America eastern always at the agenda. 
Only 13% the journalists work under contract. 
In an huge nation as wore them out, with 300 million of inhabitant and the thousand of journalist, review, radio, TV and the Internet, the employers often offer this which they want, and that quickly becomes a question to take or. 
The directors receive almost always of big salary, while the editor can earn 10 thousand dollars per 
The holiday, the logic grows intricate: x day after the first year, x day after the third, until at 15 days in all, after a certain number of year. 
But, according to were often" sick" during the year. 
This was the mistake the climates. 
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, has at GROTTAFERRATA DANILO COPPOLA. 
The president of the second penal section the courts of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the authority of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a living at Rome. 
. Coppola am investigated for bankruptcy within the context of the education relative to the climbing Unipol-Bnl. 
The trials at his load, last week, he had gotten the transformée compulsory stake in in residence at Grottaferrata. 
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent was able to cover the ride of the city of province at a living in the capital. 
According to the court, of such displacement( what the pm has not granted) would allow him to influence his society and to have access to the evidence who accuse him. 
The elites in danger. 
The phenomenon had already emerged some days ago, with the vote of the room the Rep., opposite the plan of rescue of 700 billion of dollar approved: A good significant number of American were, and still am, plus person concerned to punish Wall Street only at to save the American economy. 
And this was well he N.Y Times of who confirm to us him communicating what the current crisis does divide the republican party, still more divided between his eve soul East Coast, moderate, favourable the the institution federal as well as at the community business, and his new soul, the opposite, conservative, hostile to "this of Washington" and the worlds of the finance, powerful above all in the states the centers and the Sud. 
The soul, precisely, made to feel of way despotic with the vote whose I talked to you in the beginning. 
However this has just to be cité was only an example the change, the big change which the earthquake in course préannonce else let already to run: The not only the states Unis, but in all the west, and can be not only only here. 
The states Unis like in Europe, seem make to accelerate the phenomena hatched since some times, at tel point they que, in the new climate, solidify and reveals. 
The first of these phenomena was the updating, the extraordinary boosting, of the double category statehood -- sovereign, with respect to a kind of renationalisation of the economy. 
The crisis, indeed, was a crisis of bancaires-financières institution, obviously of narrow report with the stranger, but who, above all, am implied at big scale, the appraisals the the person and the families who do live in a lonely Pays, in an alone statehood. 
That immediately creates a political problem for who governs him: This east to say as to answer the the difficulty and the protests the persons and the families who were moreover an electorate. 
In short, the crisis economically seems world-wide but politically, was almost only here national. 
The political internationalisation really seems hors game else, number'not have big thing to say: The obvious evidence is provided us by the European Union who, divided like d'habitude, between the several interests and am entering the several national strategies, number'manages to decide on no political common line. by 
And so, this was the government of each state which all expect from the the intervention, the plan of rescue and of boosting, the new periods, and above all one affection of: When one crosses a sticky patch, it was only the states who the economic resources own, the mass of financial resource capable of trying to put back the thing to place. 
They also own the necessary means and the legitimation in order to use them: Two resources of an invaluable value, the element of no market international neither organisation will be able never to arrange of analogous way. 
This new bombast of the crisis state was the rest in: The territoriality. 
. Paradoxically, indeed, then what were we convinced of being henceforward gone in in the kingdom the networks, of the always more sophisticated technology, the material no, convinced that the globalisée finance was henceforward fate to dominate the world, we have accounted of a peal of an alone, what our future will on the contrary have to settle his counts always more with the enough little material things like the water, the crops, the oil. 
The things who who can be transportées of a place at an other of the land certainly, but who are connected to of absolute way at a space contained, at a territory. 
Thus, who who was sovereign, does own certainly more of card only this who not am, that is to say, this the bad luck of supply in a place without crop, without oil and without water. 
I am arriving now at the second novelty who however a fracture foresees. 
Who does say Territoire, inevitably statehood, Gouvernement, says Politique, and thus Leadership. 
A cet égard, the crisis economical seem to produce two convergent phenomena. 
Of rated one, the awareness the objective needs for leadership authoritarian, the research of a person knows who to take in hand the situation. 
De l'autre coté, a spate of discredit for the leadership existing economic, species who who have revealed inadequate and full of area. 
And exaggerate him, something of still more deep, in a certain sense, even worrying: A discredit, a suffering, a picture of inadequacy, a feeling of distance who who tends to involve the whole class the directors in a growing numbers of country of the west. 
So increases still more the conviction the several classes, before the actions were the same ideas the social elites up to now at their peak, their way to listen in and of being, their culture to have le même time, to be always more foreign the opinion the majority. 
In short, of leadership, the request feeds of underground way powerful, one and branched out movement of délégitimassions the the ruling classes and the political usual orders, who emerge in the "revolt" electoral improvised else, to leave from the conservative ascent in Austria Bavaria, at the fall the travaillistes in big Brittany, at the rebellion the American congressman against Bush( and it would be well able that has not managed by chance). 
One has the impression that the usual elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, would say someone, have always pleased of difficulty, this who dates step to understand and to represent the deep western coats the society, and which the economic crisis reinforces, increases and potentially waves of disproportionate way. 
At the sight of this,, frankly seem exaggerated. 
But one says well, to keep the eyes big open, that was not without reason. 
The supercolle in order to walk on the walls. 
To defeat the laws of the gravity thanks to a super glue and, in the future, to walk on the walls like Spiderman. 
There the objective of several research American centers, and today, team one of four institute there almost succeeded. 
With an adhesive hardly sised 2,5 square centimetres, the researchers have succeeded in keeping collé a body of 100 kilogrammes on a vertical wall. 
The study-- the review American Science has published the discoveries of some researchers of the university of Dayton, of Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and of the air Force Research Laboratory. 
The equipment, invented, was an evolution of this which we know who use a particular structure the carbons, called tube of carbon. 
"The principle of the glue can be imagined as a separates out of tube willing as a crushes of spaghetti." Explains Zhong Lin Wang the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta. 
The scientists have drawn inspiration the feet the geckos, covered 
The tests carried out on several materials, such than of glass, the glass, the Téflon, and the paper have proven what the adhesive news was ten faiths more powerful than the feet of these reptiles, and simultaneously, that he« easily breaks away from the wall "explains Liming Dai, researcher of the faculty of Ingénierie of the university of Dayton. 
To walk on LES MURS? "This equipment would be able to be used like temporary adhesive" add Liming Dai. 
Can be in order to walk on the walls like Spiderman? Can be that yes, but the researchers think about a much less fascinating use such than the connection is entering the electronic devices, considering only the nano tube of carbon was conductive of heat and of electric current. 
Others applications would be able to concern the aerospace engineering. 
Pour l'instant, not of super hero. 
The other RECHERCHE-- the university of Berkeley, in California, devotes her as, in search a new adhesive. 
In an article of the review American American Chemical Society, the Californian researchers have presented an adhesive formed of microfibres like the hairs, who if car cleans the dust during the movement on an area in order to guarantee a perfect and constant adhesion. 
Drug: Never the the juice. 
Mindfulness the the juice, of orange and of apple. 
These drinks, consumed been then thirst-quenching and rich in vitamin, so associate at some vital drugs, distort the absorbement otherwise accentuating diminishing according to the cases, their efficiency, the the even grave consequence for the health. 
David Nailey, professor at the of University Western in London Ontario, call again the risks the juice am, am otherwise limping fresh, so associate at the ingestion of some drugs; During the 236ème national meeting of the American Chemical Society in course in Philadelphia, he throws new one alarm: It was sufficient of a glass of juice, of orange and of apple, in order to cut back the absorbement of some vital drugs, canceling their beneficial effect and putting in risk the health the patients. 
The juice have already strongly criticised reserved responsible bus to increase the effects of some drugs arythmiques anti, antibiotic, anxiolytiques, anti staminales and neurological, until the the toxic level. 
MEDICAMENTS A RISQUE -- this was the Italian agency the drug she even, had given the news in a daté bulletin of information of two years, alerting the patient physicians and at ne not under to evaluate the dérivant danger of this mix and to make mindfulness at this which one drinks, if one takes the drugs like for example, the Diazépam or the Méthadone. 
Step QUE LE PAMPLEMOUSSE-- according to the experts, even the juice of orange and of apple contains the substances who the drugs inhibit. 
Long was the list the active inhibés ingredients by the grapefruit and the other juices. 
Of there, the call of Michele Carruba, department head of pharmacology of the university Publique of Milan: "These discoveries were in general, immediately signal the several national agencies and international of drug who will owe to the needs, to change the informative notes the drug. 
Always advisable to read the papers illustrative of the drug which one takes, and, if something was not clear, not make to impress, but to appeal clearly to the physician otherwise the chemist" has underlined the expert at the agency Ansa. 
The Nobel of the economy at Paul Krugman. 
The Nobel prize has been awarded at the American Paul Krugman for his researches on the models of business and on the localisation the economic activities. 
Krugman, 55 years, was a néo-keynésien teaches to the university and it N.Y Times. 
Krugman was a the more big critic the solution in economy and foreignpolicy of the administration Bush. 
Some months after the attacks of Sep 2001, during the days of the bankruptcy of Enron, Krugman had written, in a publié article on the N.Y Times, only the second event would have been plus determiner only the first, in term of consequence on the story the U.S. 
A forecast who of numerous controversy unleashed, and who was criticised at the economist the the year, but who who has now revealed exact. 
"I am following amazed and same little shocked one of the quickness with which to remember the scandal such than the collapse of Enron or Worldcom, have vanished from the attention the publics" had announced Krugman in the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the executive board of the European Central Bank, Krugman was a valuable" economist", but also a divulgateur the styles" very aggressive, particularly critical towards the redundances the liberalism of the administration Bush. 
Open Office, voilà the third publishing the packets" anti-Microsoft" 
This was the day of the diffusion of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the continuation open source of personal productivity who who aims to touch always and still more of user, of the house the office, the professionals at the public administration, proposing a free alternative at the more famous Microsoft Office. 
Following a work of almost an year, achieved, surveillés by SUN Microsystem, the new packet Open Office appears the generalpublic with several novelties: Of the screen of welcome, and the revue interface and grown less austere, at of the other more important, like the born compatibility for the system opératif Apple Mac OS X, and the support for the new format ODF( Open Document Format) 1.2, the last version standard ISO. 
It Open Office has made particularly mindfulness at the interaction with the continuation Office 2007, and it was indeed possible to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft .xlsx .pptx( .docx) 
As interesting, sure function specific at some modules, like this who affords to reduce the dimensions the presentation PowerPoint, useful per example, in order to send them per electronic mail, otherwise in order to matter the spins PDF in the module of elaboration graph, keeping the aspect original of the page. 
Always on this front, it was possible to create the document" PDF hybrid" united the graph typical the format Adobe the element of a leaf of calculation or of an élaborateur of text. 
The collaboration between several persons was an element who who has had several improvements the applications: In the leaf of calculation, several users can intervene, avoiding the conflicts on the modifications, in the elaboration of text, bus at each eastern collaborator allocated for a good gratefulness in phase of revision. 
Sure society even am in the process of to work in order to bring some functions of OpenOffice to the Web (one cloud the, on the cloud), and in the next weeks, they would have to issue the final result. 
The Italian version was déchargeable for the benefit of and adds the English version who found since Friday. 
Exaggerate at Windows and Mac OS, the continuation was like d'habitude available moreover, for the system opératif Linux. 
On request, the cd of installation can be sent to at home or on the workplace. 
And if the theme of the gratuitousness can be a mean in order to disseminate him in the houses, this was precisely in the business, only Open Office the continuation tempts the big challenge, being able already to count on several plans achieved in the public administration and the schools. 
Not to mention the realities who who offer a service of formation, consultation and d'assistance, ideal for the small and medium enterprise, who would be moreover able to open the the prospective of business. 
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, pro the video writing equivalent of Word; Calc, east the leaf of calculation who aims to replace Excel; Impress, pro the presentations rival of PowerPoint; Dbase, tel the famous Access, east programs him who does afford to work on the databases; Finally Drwa was the graphic module. 
Objective for 2008, to arrive at 5 million of download, and ground that today one almost counts 3 million and 600 thousand, it was likely that with the exit of the new upgrade, one was even able to outpace the expected figure

The fiery analyses belong to of this achieved these last weeks on the test tubes of Kohl, by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry. 
If counters them analysis confirm the positivité to the Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place the turns and will owe forcement to expect two years of elimination. 
The news of the positivité of Kohl at the Epo of third generation, has been confirmed by the leader of the French anti doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who Press, to have notified of the positivité the authorities Austrian. has communicated to the Associated 
The Austrian of 26 years has put in the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus swiping the undershirt spotted. 
Are immigrating: NEW YORK TIMES SE DEMANDE SI L'ITALIE EST RACISTE? 
The Italy" as country of expatriate has recently turned to a privileged destination for the immigrants "welcomed with reluctance. 
Would that turn the beautiful country into a nation of racist? There if intéroge he N.Y Times have dedicated a long article discussing the theme the racism in Italy, doing leave from the cases the young Abdul William Guibre, native the Burkina-Faso, killed last month in Milan, for asset stolen one is limping of cookie. 
This case puts in obviousness this only the N.Y Times defines like the" paradox the north": The Nordic areas were at once this where one records "more of integration and more of work", but also" a feeling immigrés most well the " 
In order to confirm the growing tension between Italian and immigrant, the NYT has made as reference to the episode intolerance of Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
Not only. 
Even the new intentional legislature by the Lega in order to slow down the immigration and the clandestins, is quoted like proof of the change in Italy. 
Proneness underlined: "Giorgio Napolitano at the time of his meeting with Benoît XVI the Quirinal, has asked this what the state and the Eglise work set in order to defeat the racism." 
Student victim the dear rents, until at 900 euros in order a chambre. 
The market the renting for student ne connait step of crisis 
According to the last inquiry the Sunia, the trade union the tenants, can cost at a student, until at 900 euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome. 
"The phenomenon has henceforward reached the very serious aspects up to scratch of to exclude the whole categories of young, the right to the study the cost overall very high what must the families of origin support -- explains the responsible for the design office, Laura Mariani -- in these cities, the strong request the student has so distorted the market only one process of disseminated increase if was amorcémême for the residents. 
In the plupart the cases, the offers of renting moreover comprize a series of violation: Contract of free type, not recorded, without limit of rent, subletting. 
For the Sunia, the extraordinary interventions by the intermediary of the revision of the fiscal taxation, were necessary in order to calm the prices. 
Reading in the inquiry, we show up only in Milan, for a bed in the area Brianza, necessary about 450 euros it; For a single room, one is going from 650 minimum euros( area Bande Nere), at a medium value of 800( area Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) at a maximum of 900 euro( area Vittoria) 
In Florence, a bed on average costs, 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros. 
Where in Bologna, are the students concentrating in the areas close to the university, necessary 250/280 euro in order a reads in a double it, and of 370 at 500 for a single room. 
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities( San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), one asks about 600 euros for a simple, 450 for a bed in a double. 
Light more low value (550 euro for a simple) for the areas close to the other universities( Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
One can save only if one is going away in the peripheral areas: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a simple in the area Predestina, Centocelle or similar. 
In Naples, for a bed necessary 300/400 euros it, for a simple, one spends of 400 at 600 euros, the the more high prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei. 
At Bari, for simple bed, necessary to count 250/350 euros it, at least 350 for a. 
In the more small cities, the prices were more low in absolute term, but they signify major importance in the urban economy. 
Finally, the cities such than Perugia, in which are the renting often taken the the first-rate communal student, one records a subsequent anomaly: by The rent asked to the foreign student is increased of 25/30% per assiduous report at this the Italian. 
Goodbye old cinema Paradiso, the cities éliment about the historical rooms. 
The historical rooms of cinema close the Multiplex. 
"A city without room of cinema was a blind city, this was like a visage without eye" 
By the director Giuseppe Tornatore, the courtesy picture well illustrates this which he dispenses in the big urban Italian centers, but also in the cities of province, 
The process of marginalization the the cinemas, with the birth in outskirt the big multisalles, and the death of consomption the mono room in the central areas the cities unquestionable, east one the major event who seems unavoidable and; It moreover all have the features of a true crime cultural. 
Has to disappear, this were often the historical places and laden with memory," this was like so one of my friends disappeared, someone which one knows, with which we do have divided one end of way and so much of emotion "watches the director the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, picture who he offers to Tornatore there 20 years, the first Oscar as well as the big price of the jurywoman of Cannes, and who told the poetry of a room of province, and the nostalgia of a way of to live the cinema, lost can be for always. 
The thick figures by Anec, the main association the shopkeeper, all want to say: These five last years, 316 cinemas of usual type have closed, and this were the rooms the main cities who have above all paid the expenses: 10 of minus in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in minus in Turin, 5 in Palerme. 
Among the areas the more touchées by the closing, the Roman Emilie was in front with 82 cinemas mono room lost, steady by the Tuscany( 44) and the Lombardy( 41). 
The evidence who the confirm t which the first official of their disappearance was the advent multiplex, then this were well the three Italian areas who have recorded most of new multisalles cinema: 195 screens on top of that in Lombardy these five last years, 81 in Tuscany like in Emilie-Romagne. 
"The Italian exploitation has developed of irrational way" Paolo Protti watches, preside of the Anec," it was useful to build of new structure but he would necessary all the same to guarantee the survival of this who exist already, then when a firm room in a city, these fréquenteurs am not inevitably all willing to go into the multiplex. 
Without to speak of the failed deliberation the credit the shopkeeper: The antécédente debt of the state was of about 10 million of euro. 
He shameful east which, of a skinny viewpoint and moral, the government does not respect the existing laws. 
In order to support the sector, would necessary between 16 and 18 million of euro per year it. 
Mark down the case of Bologna, the first Italian city who, of these closings worries, has decided to solve the situation thanks to the signature of a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of this kind in Italy, in order to defend and to promote the cinemas mono room the historical centers and in outskirt. 
Among the prescriptive expected, it has there the measures of fiscal facility the the managers and the advantage for the public in term of mobility: The spectators will be able to go in for the area at limited circulation, and having the rates special for the parking and in some parkinglots. 
"This was an initiative who me plait" watches Giuseppe Tornatore" and I hope that others cities will follow the example of Bologna putting in place others measures. 
It was however obvious only, in order to contrast the super power the multiplex, the usual rooms must to as improve the quality the sound and of the picture, then the public of today was more require. 
The defense the usual cinemas was a theme who for me, has always been important: The closing the Supercinema of Bagheria, of my childhood and adolescence, the place was the spark who has convinced me of faire" new cinema Paradiso" which I thought about already since 10 years. 
I live in Rome ever since 25 years, and when I am passing in front of the Rialto, otherwise the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, henceforward closed, I have so much lived of divided emotion, I am turning of the rated other in order to not see the noircis signs by the dust. 
Link between political and ndrangheta, order mayor of Gioia Tauro. 
« The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the townhall the interest the clan Piromalli. " 
Of heavy accusation are thrown by the magistrates of the antimafia direction of the Calabre by, towards the mayor and the vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, stopped this morning in order for mafieuse association. 
The levers also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his small already boarded-up son lawyer, homonym the boss, for mafieuse syndicate of type, as well as to pay for 10 million of euro. 
"An affront towards the prescriptive legal and moral, and above all the commonsense" write the prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay the consultations to Maître Piromalli. 
"So one would have been granted to the clan- write the judges to enter officially inside the townhalls facilitating the scope, already considerable, of test and of orientement of the public administration 
The board regional calabrais Agazio Loiero, the president does not hide only the" collusion between the local boards and the organized crime, he has pleased of a" in his area: "The the place the mafieuse intensity am more forte than where in others, the collusion was almost inevitable. 
As much of politician who stand up to the pressure of the ndrangheta but ago, the hero who were honest" 
The arrests of this morning are following this of last Jul, continuation which the police informed to have decapitated the clan Piromalli. 
From the end last Apr, the advice communal of Gioia Tauro been dissolves; Already in 1991, and always because of alleged packaging between the organized crime and the local administration, the local politicians had been unloaded of their facility to manage the city. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC the times of the dissolution, had been called leader of one right coalition of centre, after the second ballot of May 2006. 
He shouted the scandal when the prefecture arranged the dissolution the communal advice. 
He accused the vice at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing of asset devised the whole for a question political but vu, minister of the interior asks of signed incarceration this morning, the judges explain that the clan Piromalli even succeeds in asking the variation the plan of the A3. 
Leaving from the ordered interception for Dal Torrione, the pm write, was émergée" the availability to marry the demands of a businessman, imagining in order one best-known group, close to the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration the interest the clan. 
When the energy was born the wave, maintaining the big se throw. 
There a disproportionate deposit handle more and am in the process of to discover. 
Wave, current, tide, voilà has put down the eyes, and maintaining essayent to put on the hand. 
The possibility to get of the energy to leave from the movements of the sea was studied ever since henceforward cents years, and in the years 70, in concomitance with the first crisis oil, the researches have intensified. 
When the oil price was dropping, towards 1980, the idea to exploit the energy navy was put on aside, but now the ecological authority and the new increase the oil give a big expansion the sector 
The World Energy Council( WEC) of London has estimated in 2007, only 15% the world-wide needs in electricity would be able electricity to be overcast the the operatingsystems sea. 
This amount would be the double of this which the nuclear powerstations produce. 
And on top of that, it would be the currents and the tides.. 
Giant at the attack. 
The first enterprise to betted on the marine energy has been the Enersis, have siglé an agreement in order to build an installation the north the Portugal. 
When the agreement was announced, one would have said a true revolutionary step. 
At two years of, always more of candidate among these enterprises devoted ever since always to the usual energy betted on the marine energy. 
"Rafter studies currently the technologies on the oceanic energy-- has ruled the spokesman of a company associate the giant oil American, the daily economic Wall Street Journal-- and she evaluates the possibilities to cooperate with we". 
In, the cooperation concerns the procurement of a deliberate permit by the American commission for the energy, necessary in order to give place a plan of exploitation of the marine energy in Alaska. 
There an very interesting signal, above all if one considers only rightly in Alaska, wore out continue to extract the oil, and recently the president Bush has put in place a plan for of new excavation 
Goatskin at Chevron, ago Verdant Power Inc. Of N.Y and Ocean Power who the New Jersey, are covering the lane of the energy coming from the sea, and are invested in until at today, although their details were known, do indicate according to the observers, a growing interest. 
Tecnologie to put on to a turn. 
The experts talk about a technology still to his beginnings, of part the fact which the energy marinates does not dissipate the fears towards the ecological impact. 
At the current hour, the systems like this the Portugal, or some in Scotland, were of small dimension, and seem to not create of big problem at the ecosystem. 
In order to produce of the large-scale energy, however, necessary to use the technologies with an ecological superior impact it. 
"And the choices were various: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of bound buoy one the other. 
The thrust the wave, who made to move the mud towards the top and the bottom, east converted in an hydraulic pressure the piston and cylinder the floats. 
The pressure make to turn a turbine who at his tower, a generator feeds. 
The energy is sent at the bank the the cables under sailor. 
As of now, we arrange of four systems of this kind in phase of plan, in the wait of a sole federal approval and a part of the energy would be able to be useful for a military installation. 
Verdant Power, on the contrary, produces already of the commercial energy for a centre and a parking lot using six turbines under navy of the East River of N.Y. 
The movement of the water the tide, make to turn the blades the turbines, creating a rotatory movement who feeds generating one. 
Verdant has announced to have a long list of customer in wait the authorisations necessary in order to draw of the energy. 
After the waves, the tides. 
An interest particular, they say to the institute in order the research of the electrical power, deserve at the moment, the potential the tide. 
Although it was a matter of an intermittent phenomenon, the tide was more foreseeable the wind, the sun, or the waves, and thus more reliable like source. 
And this was precisely on the energy the tide that the states like N.Y, Maine and Alaska, with others, look towards the coasts, has invested 7 million and half of dollar in 2008 and foresees the investments until at 35 million in 2009.
