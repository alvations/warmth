What counts? The Prague ČSSD Voldemort does not know or pastry
The new city of ČSSD in the capital will have to overcome, it seems, the obvious language barriers for members of the Board of Prague City Council to understand their fellow renewed ODS.
Aktuálně.cz period "considered" members of the new Council of ČSSD to test your knowledge of slang markup language that has emerged in recent years when the Council ruled Prague current members of the coalition.
The dictionary coding utilizing the political elite in Prague during the previous period, the mayor Pavel Bem, includes some of the characters, situations and known causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it was found that the new council barely understand these concepts known.
Or so they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is I do not know."
"Rather, I am a novice in politics Prague," he said during the discussion of terminology of "colegueo" Councilman Kaucký Lukáš culture.
And in regard to the veteran politician, as Karel Březina reacted.
May know the term "golf hole."
"This is probably the only expression of all that you asked me to use from time to time."
"If you do not normally use slang."
Glossary, the definitions of which the newspaper published last June Aktuálně.cz before congressional vote on the ODS, the wording chosen six examples, particularly those that are specifically related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort," "greatest golf hole in Prague," "go to the bakery," "bull neck," "betrayal of the capital" and "shield."
Three council members were willing to take the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who in future will be responsible for education in Prague, at first agreed, but picked up the phone.
The fifth councilor, Petr Dolínek, refused to do so directly.
"I do not get into these things and I appreciate how fun the Civic Democrats."
"What I care about is how we understand the implementation of our programs," he said.
As seen, the Alderman Lukáš Kaucký allegedly had not realized that the above title is an expression of an influential businessman and a friend of former mayor Bem, Roman Janousek.
A Kaucký the word "Voldemort" does not say anything, the only term that was right in the examination is "the largest golf hole in Prague."
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, which immediately adds: "But this I know from the news."
"I'm going to have to point to a language course" she jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one recognized in the golf hole the Blanka tunnel, but Councilman Lukáš Plachy Environment.
Then both sociodemócratas know who is really Voldemort and Lukáš Plachy even know where to find this character, also suspected the meaning of "going to the bakery."
"I think it means going to a company in Prague, and soon it unveils Plachy it is the headquarters of companies Janousek.
As Březina, indicates that such knowledge obtained from the news, but that does not use such vocabulary.
According to participants in the trial, including sociodemócratas there is no glossary of terms familiar colloquialisms.
"I asked my colleagues, but it really seems that we have nothing like that."
"Rather, among us use nicknames, abbreviations or do sometimes puns on names," says the president of ČSSD Prague, Petr Hulínský, whose party colleagues called Hulda.
"At school, I called Bříza, but do not know if my colleagues also call me that," says Karel Březina his own nickname.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz tested the name and work.
For his party colleagues, Weinert is Deda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dedek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, which were associated with pre-election cheating in the sponsorship of the game, receives the nickname "Igráček" ("playmobil") by some of his teammates.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that sociodemócratas tolerate speech within the party.
A Hulínský not like being called Hulda, but the newspaper even found Aktuálně.cz other nicknames for this president in Prague.
"The doctor of the rights of clubs" seems recalls that Petr Hulínský earned his doctorate in law from the police academy in Bratislava.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches," as published in a booklet
Considered women as witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They usually have an advanced age, can not work, for example, for health reasons, are unmarried and have no children.
Women who "become" witches are sent to an isolated area, not to harm the rest of the people.
"Men rarely suffer such a fate."
"Nor is isolated healthy young women, because they help in the work and have children," said a nun who, in the capital of Burkina Faso in West Africa occupies a special residence for more than a hundred women expelled from their communities .
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure."
Issued a prospectus which should help to avoid witch-hunt.
However, this has a downside.
"Over 70% of adults in Burkina Faso can not read," says the newspaper Die Standard on the disadvantages of writing awareness.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighboring country of Burkina Faso, died last week Ammy Hemmah, 72, when three women and two men tortured, covered it in petrol and burned.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors state that was due to an unfortunate set of circumstances.
According to his version, the woman caught in the oil used for anointing rituals.
It caught fire when the group wanted to "expel the evil spirits" of women.
The isolation of the "witches" I support people of all educational levels.
The daily Der Standard quoted a businessman of 42 years of Burkina Faso: "The devouring human souls always represented a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government trying to appease the witch hunt in Gambia last year she still participated in the president.
"The Gambian President Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, launched an extensive hunt for witches that had supposedly been linked to death and tried to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To help bring shamans in nearby Guinea that, protected by police, military and the president's personal guard, forcibly took men and women chosen randomly from the Gambian people's property Kanilai president, noted in his report to Amnesty International.
On the farm, those arrested had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, also caused them intestinal problems and kidney.
Two of those arrested did not survive the stay on the farm.
Following international pressure, finally released about a thousand people arrested.
The tenant of Bakala, is heated with coal stoves and signing a higher rent
The man, older and strong, crossed the threshold of the customer focus of the company RPG Byty of "coal magnate" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm had some documents with the new lease of three floors: hers, his daughter and his son, who is serving a sentence.
In just the three of them catch the liberalization of rents.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns per month, the child will pay from 4,100 crowns next year for an apartment of two rooms with separate kitchen on the second category.
"Also, no hot water and heating are based on a solid fuel boiler," shows a finger to the man in the new contract for his son, on whose firm has full powers.
"But I signed it," said half angry, half-resigned.
BytyOKD.cz civil association, which called the new conditions of hire as "improper and indecent," recommends that tenants who do not sign new contracts and to wait until December 7, when they publish a guide on how to report proceed in these cases.
But before that, the only man made a gesture.
"Each one says a thing," he says with a face.
Ostrava is becoming a major testing laboratory of liberalization.
After New Year will occur with most of the apartments in the Czech Republic, were so far under a rent-regulated.
So Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The mining lobby RPG is one of four in Ostrava on Tuesday at nine, and was full.
Right next to the doors are security guards and beside a machine to take issue.
"Vacation 2011" can be read in light of a button touch screen.
When pressed, the machine leaves a piece of paper with a number.
Almost no time or read "157" and already the number shown on the big screen at the top of the room.
In a second, you are in the queue.
Soon after comes a elderly couple to ask, but the crowd is no room here for new hires.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the past, requests for repairs, insurance matters and similar matters.
Cards with the new leases will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of the tenants in most of the 44,000 apartments belonging to RPG around mid November.
Byty RPG proposes in the letters a rent increase of between 15 and 38%.
The November 18 opening a special window at the customer service center for new hires.
"It has been operating a week, so it's starting," respond, after a brief hesitation, workers who are in it when the client is presented as a journalist.
Liberalization and former miners Bakala flats are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the election, and tried out loud the deputy speaker of parliament, a native of Ostrava, Lubomir Zaoralek, the CSSD, and now appear constantly in the newspapers in the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
"I do not even changed the damn dish bath," it relieves the man mentioned in the introduction.
According to workers, for the moment are mostly pensioners to check if they receive a rent discount if they sign on time, as promised special offer RPG.
Also receive half off the February rent the other tenants to sign a new contract before 15 December.
However, the window of the "liberalization" mining certainly can not dispel the avalanche of questions.
"Of the 360 ​​clients who were here yesterday, just asked for the rent in 2011 about forty or fifty people," says the employee of the window.
Meanwhile, RPG offers on the web and in their individual boards to hold meetings on the contracts when necessary.
If both parties fail to agree on the rent, should solve the issue an independent judge.
"This is not a threat, but about the only possible way to proceed and fully conforming to the law," says RPG on your pages.
"This is not going to judge anyone," says one of the employees of Byty RPG and a man in the street outside the customer service center gives you, at least partly right.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and left me 5,000 for the food, I have no means to go to court," he says.
But immediately, the employee sowing doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek media tells them that no sign, so maybe people expect," he says.
Rent regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, as Byty RPG, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rents have not even cover the amounts needed to fund the maintenance of the community," says Pavel Klima, director of the company's residential portfolio Byty RPG, adding that the neglected state of the background of the community angry tenants is for homeowners, the main reason to increase the rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG able to invest in apartment rents four billion in the four years go from 2011 to 2014 the number will increase to 5,200 million.
The big screen hanging from the ceiling, facing the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data highlighted in red.
"The rent increase in 2011 by 15% and less than 31,200 apply to apartments, ie 90% of the properties of RPG."
"Also, always be a maximum of CZK 7.50 per month per square meter, shown on the screen.
Only a 38% increase in the rent of 400 flats RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, it is an increase from approximately extremely low amounts of 19.66 crowns per square meter," said RPG.
In 2,600 apartments, the rent shall remain unchanged next year.
Byty RPG promises that liberalization does not affect the rent strike, but will scale from four to eight years.
It adds the following undertaking: the company will invest all the money from the rent increase (see chart) back in the flats, mainly in savings on heating, new windows and heating.
People have priority to sign the agreement to increase rent.
The architects have understood that they also need care offices
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new home of the company Arch.Design.
Nobody would say that also hides inside a small nursery with all the same at such facilities: painted walls, furniture, creative and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since last October, she can go to the children of employees Arch.Design.
The Arch.Design architectural firm, whose study left many famous buildings in Brno, he thought from the first sketches of the building to include a space Avriopoint for miniguardería.
In the company employs about 90 people, mostly in the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and drafters could soon return to work after maternity.
Beside the possibility to enjoy a reduced schedule, child care is one of the benefits to their workers Arch.Design under its social program.
Builders and architects in this manner have the possibility of combining a demanding profession with childcare.
The miniguardería was an idea Arch.Designu's own employees and with the support of management, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company miniguardería is funded through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme for human resources and employment, and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding (a budget of more than CZK 2.8 million) could buy the equipment and, after two years, recruiting qualified staff and services.
When funding runs (two years), Arch.Design company is required to continue operating the miniguardería with their own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and the filing of the company contributed funding Economy Rating.
The care of children is in the hands of qualified personnel also are present throughout the day for their care nurse and a teacher of the Ministry of Education. The nursery currently welcomes children of any age, although most of them have less than three years.
Since it is a "miniguardería," can only accommodate simultaneously to a maximum of five children, although with more shifts during the day come.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to suit the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although this is a teaching and individual care, the contents of miniguardería program are comparable to early childhood education program standard.
Here the children not only play, but also receive a quality education: learning from basic to preparation for school, to teach English.
The class not only has toys and games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company to create a friendly and positive.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of late pick-up children from school when they are away from your workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive while at work.
Not surprisingly, this naturally creates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and employer.
Thus, Arch.Design is among the companies sign offering a great advantage for the admission of new workers, support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened the marketing staff.
The house of bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, stairs reminiscent of the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies look like a fish's mouth open.
This is the Casa Batlló in Barcelona, ​​the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its shape like a skeleton, locals nicknamed it "the house of bones."
Organic shapes, bright colors, innovative use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade that resembles the omnipresent scales smoothly curved lines, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The front of the house plays with lines dreamlike, delicate colors and textures drawn from nature and wildlife.
Paying more attention, there is a certain geometry, rhythm and order carefully thought out.
At night, the entire front of the house looks even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that improves the brightness of colors.
Winds and twisted forms also continues to surprise us on the inside.
Copies corrugated timber window frames, handrails, trim doors, peepholes and signs.
La Casa Batlló, located in the Eixample district number 43 of the bustling shopping street Passeig de Gracia, emerged from the remodeling a home the year 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on tearing down the previous building and start from scratch, but soon accepted the idea of ​​creating a reconstruction Gaudí new and cheaper.
However, the Casa Batlló, consisting of several apartments, Antoni Gaudí designed not alone.
Helped design the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
In fact, in their plans for the project came ornaments representative apartment in the landlord and the tiles used on the facade.
The façade also other creative workers and artists.
Collaboration in the Batlló House proposals was the beginning of the successful collaboration with Gaudí Jujol.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Mila and Parc Güell, which are other parts of it.
Due to its organic form, the premises soon after its completion, the nicknamed "the house of bones."
Others, due to the specific mechanism for opening the windows began to call "the house of yawns."
It is said that, at the top of the building, appears the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements hidden religious building.
Gaudí designed the house in a single system for the central heating season ventilation vents and chimneys typical.
It may seem strange inclination of forty-five degrees.
During construction, Gaudí did not respect at all construction standards of the time and was not swayed by them.
Still, the building received a permit from the beginning, but obviously he set about rebuilding data provided was so vague that, two years after its completion, the council was so impressed with the result called corrected.
He resented, for example, that building columns included even the public sidewalk.
Arrangements were never made, rather the opposite: only fifteen days after the request of the council, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two upper floors of the building.
In the lower floors were installed by the owner.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The house, six floors, is fully intersected by a stairway leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform lay in breaking all the angles and straight lines, curved walls covering them.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be connected entirely by opening the classroom doors and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without waiving the necessary privacy for intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only got a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also amazing how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles covering the interior patio and skylights.
The game with the two colors provides maximum light on all floors of the house.
Was based simply on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which absorb instead of sun rays.
Anyone can visit the Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the list of world heritage of humanity by Unesco.
On the first floor of the apartment house is more spacious and more ornate of the publicly accessible.
The owners decided to open the doors in 2002 to mark the 150 th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With visits confirmed or discovered, which is a very beneficial business and extended visits to the common area and the attic, including the roof terrace.
The price of entry to the monument is not negligible, amounts to 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and tourist card holders receive a 20% discount.
The amount significantly exceeds the price of the entry of other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of a bed with their lizard towers should quickly befriend a resident of nearby houses and home visits.
How to choose the mattress and box spring: women and men looking for different things
Nothing pompous framework for the bed, what really gives a good quality bed is the surface to lie, ie, the mattress and box spring.
Above all should complement each other perfectly to suit individual users.
During the election come into play many factors, including weight, height, health status and sex of the owner.
It is also important indoor type which places the mattress and box spring.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cottage that is not usually heated, do not use latex mattresses because they "warm up" more slowly.
In addition, typically weighing considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn them frequently.
Failure to properly aerate the center channel and above, are on a firm footing, kept inside moisture. Even mold may appear below.
When choosing a bed, also influenced by the customs.
Anyone who has spent much time abroad, often using a high mattress with a soft layer and have trouble feeling good in a lower surface and hard.
"Almost all hockey players in the NHL again complained that they did not sleep here as well."
"For his crushed shoulder, ankles and hips needed mattress with a soft layer of memory foam."
"This kind of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes nervous system problems early, so you get bad information from the joints and skin," says Sylva Hadamcziková, which specializes in furniture upholstery.
Many hockey players, as well as other clients, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today, no problem, because they have been properly Magniflex Tempur and Italians, but also the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
You no longer have to be an NHL player to appreciate the viscoelastic.
This "miracle" works very simply.
Optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing puts pressure, and at night, will not turn and after a tough match.
Just to sleep better.
The viscoelastic also functions as a protection against ulcers.
When choosing size mattress, add to its height the length of their feet, ie between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm bed need between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width should be a person in a double room, 90 cm, 180 cm in total.
In the case of single, singles such, we recommend at least 120 to 140 cm.
For a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple rule to calculate the width: to lie face up, hands should be comfortably tucked into the elbow," advises Helen Prokopova engineer, expert Cechu čalouníků to dekoratérů, which has for many years dealing of healthy sleep problems and ergonomic furniture, subject taught in specialized schools.
In the double rooms, each needs its own box spring and mattress, so during the purchase is to pay attention to match the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the mattresses at different heights, which is not always possible on all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the inner spring models at least 15 cm, of which at least three inch are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and smooths.
"When you touch it with your hand or sit down on the mattress, no doubt noted the springs should not," says Helena Prokopov.
Each mattress requires a particular type of mattress.
The bedroom fully padded, in which the mattress and the base are like Siamese twins, no sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe wrong and you can not wash its case, which is often done today.
And because we sweat every night between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after five or seven years the mattress begin to remember a great (and crowded) sieve.
For this reason, experts disagree with the slogans that portray a life of the mattress up to 25 years or even a lifetime warranty.
However, everything has a catch.
So, sellers give a tip on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, handle carefully cleaning and washing of the cover, but better to add a mattress protector that can be removed and easily cleaned.
While currently manufactured mattress covers with zip around its perimeter, so that they stay open into two parts (very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!) Handling in their higher size (and by one person) to lift the mattress may seem like a fight between a flyweight and a heavyweight.
In bed, instead of a mattress, do you have a table stand?
Never!
As for the beds much thought to spend a night visits.
However, it should do (if you have not already) vents on the table and should be used with a spring mattress inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the springs in bags (like the German Taschenfederkern) and a layer soft.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For Slatted not be articulated and containing between 14 and 18 pictures, you can use latex mattresses or mattress sandwich (for example, a combination of latex and coconut fiber), but it is always better a mattress with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which blades are reinforced lumbar and adjustable stiffness.
The articulated mattress sheets should not be used with a spring mattress, since it does not react to recline.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the blades, you can also use the shoulder protection.
This is a special setting that allows pressure plates, or even bend the blades so that "surround" perfectly on the shoulders during sleep.
For men with very broad shoulders, it is very important.
Even remember them mattresses manufacturers, the "male," began to use a softer area just around the shoulders.
Also remember the women, which put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are bases with cross-shaped structure or the so-called buffer strips multitorsión.
The pressure is distributed between different points and stress reduction.
You should be aware that, even if you use the right mattress and box spring, if you use a bad pillow (large and "soft"), will disappear with the most benefits.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and the corners can only go up to the shoulders, so they can relax their muscles.
The appropriate size recommended is 50 x 60 cm, normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on your side, the pillow should be level (when combined with the base or reinforced shoulder area of ​​the mattress softer) than shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have something to do, it seems, with the original mattresses stuffed with straw.
Manufacturers are using more and more often, natural materials, or at least mixtures.
In fact, they are fashionable organic mattresses.
Raw materials base of oil, which manufactures polyurethane foam, are filled with natural oils, eg castor oil or soybean.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soy.
"Biologically, in the case of mattresses, it means that the center is made of only natural materials," explains Petr Vašíček Company Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for the microcapsules, which release a fresh scent of woods and lavender.
There are also differences between men and women.
While men are "cool" breeze plant extracts, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, women prefer to "warm up" the case.
The red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so that women feel more warmth.
Are the current favorite?
Foam mattresses made of cold, which are more porous, with a structure adapted cells, which makes them more permeable than normal polyurethane and offer greater permeability.
The combination of various rigidities cold and viscoelastic foam mattresses can manufacture various areas that they know exactly where you head, shoulders and heels.
A good quality mattress will cost seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as sanitary facilities.
The first advantage obtained in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save in mattresses and box springs.
Sometimes it can approve the bids from the manufacturers or vendors, which sometimes offer two beds for the price of one.
For example, the brand mattresses Duofreeze Magniflex offers a Memory foam attached to the cover for 11,990 crowns.
The second is achieved for free.
The era of viscoelastic open cell structure and a high density material began with the "cosmic" Tempur.
Initially emerged as a material for NASA because astronauts praise during takeoffs were subjected to a massive overload.
Tempur softens when heated and hardens when cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, perfect and exerts a pressure adapted perfectly.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent wounds, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Memory foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for medical devices, for example pillows placed under the legs and relieving and circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use foam or Twinsaver Eucatherm C and the like.
More and more parents use monitoring devices people to control their children
Fear for children takes more and more people think about GPS monitoring.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, you can also track the movement of people and contribute, for example, if the disappearance of nine-year Janatková Anick.
By the time the device is about the size of a matchbox, but soon reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were afraid the case of the missing Anick and began reporting on the resources available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading privacy.
"Everybody tried to say that it is not spying, but other means to reduce the chances of a tragedy occurs," notes the company Petr Pilin Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I recognize that in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they get into someone's bag without his knowledge, but we still have not come across such cases."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In his opinion, children should always know what it is for the "box" and how it is used in an emergency.
Dana Bočková child psychologist warns that, if the child does not want to take it, simply pull.
"Even young children show great creativity to intentionally lose when certain things if they want to avoid being controlled."
"Before, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but they could just as easily as turning off the tracking device," says Bočková.
In his view, it is questionable whether such a device if an attack is really useful.
"If an abduction is prepared, the author almost always check whether the child gets any type of electronic device that can reveal their location."
"Now is the phone."
"As more widespread use of tracking devices is also sought, since its sale without a doubt be done with much publicity" ..
"In such cases, criminals are always one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech RC Monitoring Company, which provides tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack will immediately destroy the tracking device, its presence can be helpful.
"You can set the device to send regular position after a certain period."
"If you suffer damage, at least provide the latest position of the person in question."
"The more expensive devices have a built-in inclinometer, so if a person slips and just sits still, the device will immediately issue a warning to the position in question," said Čech.
In his view, a service of this type can be obtained even with smart phones with navigation, in which only special software must be installed.
The problem of tracking units today is that by the time these devices with a similar size to a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, may be lost.
According Pilin Macro Weil, for that reason they are testing devices that currently look like a digital clock.
"They will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device."
"O that identifies after some time, which can make the police save time," he adds.
Although tracking devices carried on the wrist or hanging, still use the same technology used to track vehicles.
It is checking the position with a GPS system (used in normal navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough locks to go around the Czech Republic. But only last two years
The Czech army purchased 445 kilometers of a wick to ignite explosives.
Already last year the Defense Ministry said its arsenal 224 kilometers wick.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the wick is two years, four at most.
The military bought the fuse for explosives at STV Group, a. s. for forty million crowns.
General staff responded to MF DNES justify buying such a huge amount of mecha saying that soldiers need training for maneuvers wick 60 kilometers per year.
According to the calculations of the fireworks of the army, with which she contacted MF DNES, it was decided, however, that if so, should perform these maneuvers with frequent use of explosives each year as well all the generals, officers in high command, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They would not exempt either Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Vlastimil Picek army captain.
Only thus could justify the military spent forty miles of fuse.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have sufficient stocks for over ten years.
If on the contrary, as experts say, for initial training of each new career is a maximum of two meters of fuse, the army would have to re-purchase (including adding a consumption or special engineering units) sufficient stocks for the 225 listed above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade recently complained personally to the Minister Vondra because they say they have little ammunition for various weapons, so even the limited target practice as a matter of money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"Nor did I realize that we buy such quantities of cord repeatedly."
"But it's his decision and certainly know why they act that way."
"For us, the army is a good customer who, as a company, we try to meet," admits the commercial director of STV Group, Jan Decky.
The Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek defend the hundreds of miles of Wick also saying that stocks will this "ammunition" at least for ten years.
However, Jan Decky, STV Group, indicates that the fuse only has a lifespan of four years and, in the case of fireworks for the army or the police, for two years.
"If stored in perfect conditions, can last up to four," one soldier said that, any criticism of the army, not to give his name.
After the completion of its life, each munition should be checked carefully to see if it remains reliable and will not harm soldiers.
But these tests are free and require no additional investment.
Another argument is that the Ministry, to buy 445 kilometers of wick, got a discount.
"We cost 60% less than last year's order of 244 kilometers," the spokesman Pejšek shopping center at the Ministry of Defence.
Just for comparison: annual consumption of pyrotechnic fuse the police, who removed the ammunition from the Second World War or the left by the Soviet army, not exceeding years and 1,500 meters.
Furthermore, the police always ask only just enough to exhaust the ammunition before it ends its life.
We decided for reasons of safety for fireworks and also in the meantime you can get more modern types of cord and reliable.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in completing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people are preparing for a campaign on the Rhine
According to the fireworks with which he spoke MF DNES, after a couple of years will see the following problem with now will have to delete hundreds of miles of old wick, you are buying now "cheap."
Until now I still live in the contacts I got through the competition
The fact of winning the "Entrepreneur of the Year" Lukáš Pytloun helped in selling franchises for their hotel.
The last edition, won the contest "Entrepreneur of the Year" the entrepreneur of 28 years Lukáš Pytloun of Liberec.
His success story straight out of a movie.
A Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
Overseas realized in Liberec needed quality accommodation at reasonable prices.
With the savings brought with seasonal work abroad and a credit from the bank bought a house that was crumbling five-story compound.
Given that he was still studying his third year in college, it was really brave.
"Today, the value for money accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
Began renting the first floor rebuilt foreign workers.
All the income obtained invested back into the building, which gradually became a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, seven years in business, managed to slowly open in Liberec four pension, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the design hotel of four stars Pytloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tise, which we sold our franchise concept, and others are showing interest in a franchise Pytloun," the number one employer last year.
"This sale of licenses for the opening of hotels greatly helped by the fact of winning the" Entrepreneur of the Year, '"adds Pytloun grateful.
The victory increased his fame and popularity in Liberec and the surrounding villages.
"People recognize me on the street, often still congratulating me and I must say, that was very nice," he recalls.
Without a doubt, recommend everyone who wants to try some companies that participate in the contest.
But consider that it is not necessary to win, but it is beneficial participation.
Affirms that, so far, still lives of contacts and acquaintances, without contest, probably would not have obtained.
"With some people I met through the competition I started to work normally."
The fame associated with success, in his view also included in employee
in total around seventy.
"I've seen show more loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained widespread recognition."
"It is not far from my own personal success, but is the result of hard work the whole team."
"It's just my name that appears on the front page," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
To my successor I wish you a peaceful year than we've had in FARMET
The euphoria of victory was soon dispelled by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of winning, you may FARMET already passed the worst.
The owner of the company FARMET, Karel Žďárský received first prize in the latest edition of the Vodafone "Company of the Year" last year in the House Slavic Prague.
The jury appreciated its efforts with those who managed to turn a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice in a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the award encouraged me not only me but all my staff and enhanced our confidence to fight the competition," said the winner of last year.
The FARMET company history begins with the desire to do something useful.
So when the State proposed to the father of Karel Žďárský rent a small workshop in compensation for the seizure of property under communism, did not hesitate too, resigned from the company they worked and with a couple of mates founded the company with its parent cell plastic.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later became the largest manufacturer of pneumatic presses the center of Europe.
Gained a higher profile also among the lay public after success in the competition in the media.
"Not only our customers began to consider the brand FARMET as considerably better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate the collaboration with a company that had a greater success in their country," says Karel Žďárský.
Last year was perhaps not FARMET just a taste of the euphoria of victory.
Also earned recognition for business performance through 2008 and partially 2009.
And just the year 2009 was the toughest year for machinery sales.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet reached many citizens, prompting firms stopped their investment projects and start limiting the purchase of new machines and technologies.
"We obviously do not get rid of that situation."
"Revenues were reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some layoffs," says Karel Žďárský.
A viable business must sometimes take even unpopular measures.
However, the situation under control and maintained the company's earnings, albeit at lower levels than before the crisis.
Nevertheless, where spending was not cut FARMET in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training, we reinforce the presence in the international market and we got great reviews in national fairs," says Žďárský.
All indications are that already left the crisis behind.
Revenues are rising again, and with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement expected to provide a feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
A survey reveals the ridiculous rules
The absurdity of the year poll is part of the tournament for the fourth time business.
It has already succeeded in eliminating some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the survey absurdity of the year was the requirement to keep the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was taken more than a third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the social security administration requested an extract from the commercial register, but its officials can get it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech government social security and not ask for an extract from the trade register when making a control of the deposits of the insured," said spokeswoman Jana ČSSZ Buranov.
The aim of the survey absurdity of the year is to consult the rules and regulations to be followed by companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year is the fourth time in the tournament publishing business and start Hospodářské noviny also revive enthusiasm among the general public.
While last year's event was attended by three thousand voters, this year reached nearly four thousand.
And not surprising, since we still have more than enough legal obligations to be met simply to trade.
"Maybe the number of documents required for tax return we are first world," said Karel Havlicek of the Association of SMEs and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business rules is a declared objective of all governments.
However, compared with the rest of the world, especially improving situation in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for a business, Czech Republic stands at 74 th position, ie, eight worse than last year.
The absurdity of the Year contest was held for the first time in 2006 and each year they repeated the same way.
Anyone can indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity each year between April and late September, when the contest closes.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. After the contest organizer chooses seven nominees for the "spoof" and, in October, allows the public to vote online through www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Win the most votes absurdity.
For this year's survey were over a hundred, including 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
The examples were sent to both employers and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" contest stood, for example, the requirement for vehicles for maintenance of roads and highways pay tolls or employers with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of the seventy proposals this year is published on the website of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place in early November in Prague's Wenceslas Square, is part of an event that often involves political personalities and social.
This year, for example, attended the ceremony of the contest Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of SMEs and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic, and Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity can not be sustained if the state continually puts obstacles to entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate each year a minimum of thirty paragraphs currently trade unnecessarily complicated," said the Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek .
Efforts to eliminate the absurd regulations are not watered down.
In 2007, what most annoyed people was the employer's obligation to communicate with a three-day advance to area corporate office in continuous operation, the intention of going to a job at a fair or exhibition.
This requirement was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The requirement that finished second in number of votes in 2007, ie, communication to the office of work by foreign workers working trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card .
And the third time's the charm.
The absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to take your query a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
So this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying it had eliminated the requirement to have a fridge.
A new category recognizes the socially responsible companies
We evaluated the ecological projects, humanitarian, educational or sports.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the contest Hospodářské noviny is more responsible company called 2010.
The task of this contest is to support companies responsible and fair.
"So we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activities on the environment and supporting socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the company's mobile operator Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
For this new special subcategory of this year's main competition Vodafone Company of 2010 there were firms for whom commercial success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each one of them is inspiring and we would write a separate article.
Although the type of activities varies completely from one to another, the common denominator is the support and consideration that they offer.
In one case, it is for example the disabled, other personal problems or health of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists stood throughout the Republic, for example, an enterprise software Prague Et Neter, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the area of ​​Pardubice is Isolite-Bravo Company, which ran for seven years to be the main contributor of funds to support disabled children.
In Poděbrad, there is paperwork that takes special care of the health problems of their workers, since they constitute over 70% of the workforce, hence the title company was responsible for the central area of ​​the Czech Republic and in the competition Vodafone Company the year ended in third place in the region.
In Olomouc won the Soft MiRyz accounting firm, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours without reducing salaries.
The title was awarded it because they buy primarily to Czech manufacturers, supports community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and administrative activities cause the least possible impact on the environment," explains the entrepreneur Miluše Ryznarová.
IT company responsible Enlogit the Ústí region also considers the health of their employees and, with each handset, offered a chair and ergonomic keyboards, also supports the work from home and business events using catering services a local business protected.
"In addition, we support the person in distress grant, which helps in particular to the local Roma community," said company representative Ondřej Suchý.
Also put in a good place to mention the laundry business čištění PRANI to the region of Karlovy Vary, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way affecting their pension funds.
"We provide benefits in food, transportation, upgrading skills and leisure," says Josef Strapáč, the construction company Bruntál Czasch, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the Business category for the Year was appointed automatically to all the regional finalists of the Vodafone Business of the Year contest responding to questions on the registration form and sent by 15 August to the organizers.
The organizers dropped from the evaluation forms that were incomplete or erroneous.
"If the contestants company representatives did not respond to questions, could not participate in the contest of company responsible of the year, but are not disqualified from the contest" primary "Vodafone Business of the Year."
"The individual candidates for this competition are not allowed, since it is a subcategory of the company's main competition this year," Goldman says Karel advice Bison & Rose.
Police made arrests in a public auction in the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
Corruption police made several arrests in the building of the Agricultural Fund in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed a local businessman of the media sector and real estate developer G. Luboš
It appears that this attempt to manipulate public auction under way to restore the rights of the land so that it should receive an interested auctioned accurate.
Should pay for it to Luboš G. half a million kronor.
"At the moment I can only say that the police search a person for bribery during a public auction and public bidding," he told Právo the attorney general's chief Antonie Zelená Pilsen, adding that at present can not disclose more details ongoing research.
After twenty four hours, police let the employer of 46 years.
On how that might influence the public auction, given the scant official information can only speculate.
Agricultural Fund spokeswoman Lubomira Černá answered questions Právo saying police actually conducted the arrest at the headquarters of Pilsen and it was during a public auction.
"This is a customer, not one of our workers," he said.
According Černá, the auction is called "Call for Proposals for transfer of land under the land law" and is done when displayed various stakeholders in relation to the land offered.
"These people, during the call, provide a higher value than your refund, which must be transferred before the announcement of the value of the land."
"Based on the bids, determines the order of the guests and then the Agricultural Fund transferred the land to the person offering the highest bid," said the spokesman of the Fund.
Luboš G. had information about who was going to submit to the call and, because the person concerned because time is acquired various rights to restitution, proposed to the stakeholders in the field would not participate in the auction.
For this favor, was charging a fee.
This would explain why, at the time of arrest, had so much cash.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Fund and has long Pilsen.
Contained in the case of the former head of Václav Sankot PF, which was accused by dispatching the replacement of land for which had already been issued a construction decision.
For example, Luboš G. Fund just get some land earmarked for construction of public infrastructure, particularly in the place where you should build a big road to the industrial area of ​​Borská pole.
Then the changed very beneficial to the magistrate for a home in the very center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the council had to intervene because otherwise the land would prevent the building locked.
Families must pay an additional expenditure of several hundred crowns a month
Households have to pay since January, not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, accessories for heating, and in some cases, higher rents.
Consequently, families will be drawn from the portfolio since January, several hundred crowns a month now.
The price of electricity increased by 4.6%, gas by about 2% in some cities will pay up to 10% more for water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise of electricity for households living in apartments should amount to about SEK 100 a year more than now.
However, the major electricity suppliers cut prices because it has increased support for the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaics.
However, the gas is moderately expensive, especially when more is used for heating and therefore higher consumption.
In this case, must also have a couple more hundred crowns a year.
While electricity and gas become more expensive throughout the country, the change in the price of central heating varies from place to place.
The planned price increase mainly the largest municipality.
For example, households in Hradec Králové Pardubice or paid since January by the central heating about 50 crowns per month, while Liberec families pay more than SEK 1,000 more a year.
Prague residents must also support an increase of 9% of water and heating, especially in the event that the city increase the rent of infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the Prague will pay a 6.8% surcharge.
Prices in Prague, however, remain among the lowest in the country.
In northern Bohemia, where the current prices are among the highest, both rates by 7.4% more expensive.
Can significantly increase the rental prices of 450,000 flats rented in Prague, where regulation ends in January.
For example, the CPI Byty company, which has in Ústí nad Labem about 2,500 apartments, the rent will increase from January up to 100%.
The company will bring to justice those who disagree with the new hire.
The regulated rents, which benefit about 300,000 residents of flats could increase next year to 10%.
Young people get drunk with Fernet Czech and rum. Beer is no longer so, because it slowly effect
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskey stolen from their parents.
These are drinks that cause health care end up in young drinkers with an age less than fifteen years.
Children who have just lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover and no exception.
This stems from the experience of physicians who encounter such cases in the pediatric hospital admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because they take too long to get drunk."
"Now the fashion is strong alcoholic beverages," said Praveen chief Hořovice Pediatric Hospital in central Bohemia, Luděk Pelikan.
"When they take him to his father a bottle from the cupboard, it can be whiskey, but usually it is Fernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage that is lightened with juice and does not smell much," he explains.
The spokesman also confirmed the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
"These are the modern alcohol, particularly among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, use brandy caught at home," adds Jurinová.
According to the head Pelikan are drinkers of thirteen and fourteen years that usually appear in hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where he works from this year, he spent a decade in pediatrics at Motol, where ambulances had to young people from nearby areas.
"One girl had to enter maybe four times."
"It started at age twelve, when they brought with 3.5 blood alcohol, as well as a mixture with ecstasy," the doctor of the department on this case.
"He was in fair Holešovice dance at a party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother and was surprised that her daughter disappeared 48 hours," the head is struck.
It is precisely the lack of parental interest or even clear tolerance toward drinking by their children which is considered the main cause of increased consumption of alcohol among young people.
Experts say that in the case of children, can not properly speak of dependence.
"Alcoholic means a person who has a chronic alcohol dependency for many years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather a social or family environment consistently failed," said the head Pelikan.
Jurinová spokeswoman, this year in the pediatric clinic in Motol was hospitalized in mid-November to forty children drunk.
However, statistics show only presenting with severe poisoning and should remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after medical examination street, go home with parents or the police, do not count.
In addition to cases in which children simply gather after school and drink liquor, to Pelikan there are three seasonal fluctuations include: the Halloween, New Year and the end of the school year.
"In such circumstances, drink for the wrong notes or, conversely, celebrate the start of the holiday."
"On the day of the witches have come to see in admissions to seven children while drunk," says Pelikan.
Drinkers who spend the night in detox under the supervision of physicians, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day not suffering from a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose is prevented by the injection of serum glucose and nutrients missing from the body.
"They are so much better, because after the hectic night, stand up well and does not hurt anything."
"Just become confused about where they are," Pelikan says, adding that often patients lose at least a good mood when they see the costs they have generated.
The ambulance transport and hospitalization in a room for serious patients can cost ten thousand crowns.
"I've often used the charge as a means of educating, when the visit the children directly say how much it cost her drunk and would have to spend the summer in a youth work to earn enough to pay that night "Pelikan says.
Insurance, in your opinion perhaps as far down, often people return to the cost of treatment, it does in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft meet for the first time in the wrong hands in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of five, by which the Czech Defense Ministry replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed on Tuesday for Seville, where the aircraft manufacturer House - EADS.
It is the first time that a device of this type is in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
For now, only been working abroad for practice flights or demonstration.
This is the roadster L-159T1, so far used the Czech army and was still in a state of flight.
The three remaining aircraft are single-seat L-159.
They still retain in Aer Vodochody and broker the sale, the company Omnipol, since they took over last week.
Jan Peješk, the press department of defense, indicates that it is not known when the aircraft is physically removed Vodochody.
"The single-seat L-159 aircraft, however, were separated from the aircraft repaired long ago, without additional investments or contributions by the Ministry."
"The two-seat L-159T1 were exchanged in its current state," said Praveen Pejšek.
He added that the army does not run two-seater aircraft, as in May 2009 the Army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody amounting to 200 million crowns for the construction of four L-159 devices unnecessary seaters.
One of the new aircraft and was received by the army in July, the other will be delivered later this year.
According Pejšek, EADS promised that the planes were added to the equipment of some Allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the company that removes L-159 aircraft and will serve to the practices of pilots from NATO countries."
"Therefore, depending on the buyer to decide how you will use in this context," says Pejšek.
Hospodářské noviny newspaper published ahead of time, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 aircraft for a House and three other aircraft purchase by NOK 3,500 million were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolanek.
The Ministry of Defence invited tenders for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current direction of the defense contends that the exchange promotes the export of L-159 future abroad.
The Czech army Aer acquired 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so you want to sell.
Home buying aircraft may come to have legal consequences.
The European Commission has accused the Czech Defense Ministry before the European Court of Justice because the planes should be chosen by a European competition and not contacting a single vendor.
The army has already received three planes House and the latter should arrive at the airport in Prague's Kbely fourteen days.
An index finger longer than ring finger indicates a lower risk of developing cancer
Men with longer index to the ring are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British magazine about cancer.
May depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men aged up to 60 years," said study co-author Ros Eeles, professor at the Institute for Research cancer at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger may help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, particularly if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other adverse factors such as family health problems, according Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, followed up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, of 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index finger of right hand shorter than the ring finger.
Had the same chance of having prostate cancer that 19% of those whose fingers were of equal length.
In the case of men with an index longer than ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33% for men aged less than 60% reduction was 87%.
The relationship between the length of two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflecting different levels of hormones to the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to an index longer.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes told ČTK who knows the study but did not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "fully show."

The internet service provider Amazon has removed the platform of disclosures of your server.
Possibly behind is political pressure following the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic papers.
Assange, founder of Wikileaks, apparently being held in England.
The revelations of Wikileaks platform is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently seeking a homeland Internet in Europe.
The well-known U.S. senator, Joe Lieberman, calls to other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, located on the wanted list of Interpol, be detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks server expelled from Amazon."
"Speak freely in the country of freedom," the activists communicated the revelations by the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Earlier, the Internet company, Amazon had removed Wikileaks documents on your server.
Internet activists had used in the publication of diplomatic documents secret to the Amazon web services to cope with the high levels of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained: "OK, will allocate our dollars to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of its server by Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman have been applied research, CNN reported as a call to Lieberman's office.
The Senate chairman of the board for the security of the country had threatened to boycott Amazon, said the British "Guardian."
"I had hoped that Amazon would take these steps before, before the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman also sought the platform in other countries also prohibit the use of the server.
"The illegal process, monstrous and inconsiderate of Wikileaks brings into play our national security and threatens the life of the world," he said in a statement from the independent senator.
"No company liable, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks extend his service to stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on the wanted list of Interpol.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent," Australian 39 year old is in custody in Britain, Scotland Yard called the right place.
The internet activist has consistently qualified research in Sweden as a frame of your enemy.
Wikileaks spokesperson, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that there have been threats.
"There were even calls for murder of Julian Assange."
So there are fears for the safety of Assange said Hrafnsson.
Therefore, it is still not disclosed the location of the founder of Wikileaks.
Hrafnsson clearly reacted to the statements of America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, said the head of the revelations of Wikileaks should be tried for treason and should be executed.
In Canada, said an adviser to prime minister Stephen Harper, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Among the White House and a major dispute grows Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for the American president Barack Obama, called it "ludicrous" that Assange has demanded the resignation of Secretary of State, where she is responsible for ordering diplomats recently become involved in spying.
"I'm not entirely sure why we should import the opinion of a guy with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and interests of this country are much stronger than its website."
The American government has to prove the effectiveness of the protection of databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution of the National Anti-Terrorism Center, was named outstanding manager, said the White House.
As Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms, which are necessary in light of the leak of Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads and change the total information on government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that to deal with the safety of dissidents and activists, must jeopardize the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything possible to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman, Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The University of ice cream
In the "Gelato University in Bologna ice cream prepared in the best times of year.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream has the highest influx and visitors from around the world.
Do you really where it comes from all the ice cream?
Del gelatiere and gelataio.
The cream gelatiere produced by all the rules of Italian art of making ice cream.
The gelataio removed with a spatula the ice cream counter, which extends over the wafer and sell it.
To know this, you do not go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to know more about ice cream, you should visit the "Gelato University" Carpigiani Italian company.
The manufacturer has equipped the school with ice cream freezer in 2003, so the ice cream of their machines meet the high ideals Italians everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream has the highest influx and visitors from around the world.
There are also more specialized courses more days on chocolate ice cream parlor and practices in the home.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk in the soft ice cream its sinful desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, this art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and eventually wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke from Berlin, is a consultant to businesses and want to create something of their own in a few years working within a drug.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, is because their children love Italian ice cream.
The ice cream maestro Luciano Ferrari subsequently explained to participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is crucial only their taste, but its silky smoothness and good consistency.
Luciano has not forgotten his training or cream cover the national upper house and mainly in the south, "Italian ice cream is simply the best, so each ball is something romantic."
The first step in the development seems to snap.
Luciano check the basic ingredients: milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer, which heats all with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and when it cooled to four degrees.
Then open the valve on the machine and get a basic white cream pasteurized, the basis for all types of ice milk.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Is the ice cream can be made only with natural elements without estabalizador?
How can unleash some desire to experience?
Luciano advised to mislead the trends of the time.
The ice cream speaking "not only from natural ingredients," maybe used stabilizers, especially a natural product, probably guar gum, guar bean.
Of course that can be made ice cream without stabilizer, but you have to buy one day, put in a bag and a sound bite client granite ice.
Allow certain variations in the basic mass.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, maestro Luciano distinguish between the ingredients that are purchased in the section of fruit or candy in the supermarket.
Furthermore, there are powders and pastes.
"All providers try flavored brew ingredients in their merchandise."
"However should ever experience."
Either sugar fruit sorbets and fresh fruit.
Or even ice cream white basic mass, which eggs will turn yellow and cream with cocoa powder as a base for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now the course participants can use ice cream makers.
Luciano lets them develop more and four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic mass, more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
Also performed the same experiment with types of frozen fruit.
You know better not necessarily depend on having more aroma of toffee or more fruit puree.
No need to know hazelnut ice cream with nuts, if it contains nuts.
The working group produced the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and less of a stabilizer.
First, a balanced mix enhances the flavor of ice cream, says Luciano.
Ice cream making is a matter of arithmetic: Used peach puree with sugar, you have to reduce the ratio of sugar to the basic recipe.
For the lemon ice cream need an extra serving of sugar.
Luciano takes a tool with which sets the amount of sugar in fruit types (measuring the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape.)
Fortunately, the tables provide the account.
Prepare ice cream is not the application requires more than physical, as before.
Not only helps the tool for the automatic production of the basic dough.
There is also a tool, which simultaneously breaks the ice cream mixture prepared and cooled to temperatures below zero.
Nevertheless, all the automation is left out in the small pasta.
Brazilian Gustavo staining himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree, miniprimer like a giant out of control.
"In all courses," says the maestro Luciano, "is just a matter of time before something happens."
Inspectors in a difficult situation
The European Food Safety Authority EFSA food industry has infiltrated experimenting with transgenic plants.
At present this issue as the panel made Testbiotech, which is considered an institute for independent evaluation of the impact of biotechnology.
"It looks like a conspiracy theory but we have not documented well," said Christoph Then, director Testbiotech on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, director of the EFSA Panel on genetically modified plants, and other EFSA experts are also engaged for years in the association ILSI.
Consortia such as Monsanto, Nestle and Bayer will cost you.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to the rules of evidence EFSA of genetically modified plants, which places him in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
The provisions of paragraphs EFSA are in the same terms with the documentation of the status of ILSI and imitate the writing of the company, which in reality is controlled by Italian authorities in Parma.
It is the second time that critical Testbiotech a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a senior manager of EFSA was without the support of the transition time Agrarkonzern Syngenta of Switzerland, and it has changed his side.
Recently, also Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) revealed personal connections between the authorities of the EU inspection and industry, who conducted the General officinal Environment and clairvoyant EU parliament.
However, EFSA can not recognize a conflict of interest.
It uses all formal data, also some of the industry, provided they are of high technical quality and are arranged in a report.
Not required to work in EFSA experts who have no contact with industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the U.S.
He calls himself as a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, including for risk assessment for biotechnology without custom Lobby.
In this issue, independent experts, as Then, they complain that currently allow transgenic plants without investigating the food for the animals and did not check the influence of genetically modified plants into the environment.
"We want to know why, for example, makes the genetically modified maize in agriculture," said Then.
The current practice is to check only isolated proteins, but not the whole transgenic plant, which is not reliable results.
"If you are looking for risk, how will they find?" He asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck believe in the same way.
The scientific research since 1994 the field of genetic engineering and currently works at the Technical Institute in Zurich.
In this area, the industry is increasingly in the U.S. and Europe, influence or discredit the scientific critics.
So, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For businesses, critical studies are not generally published.
"The industry controls the security screening," maintains Hilbeck.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell has been some, a total of 400 kilos.
On Monday I was at the station in Stuttgart, with the tuba on his back.
Demonstrations
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the bulldozers arrived and began to demolish a large chunk of the north wing.
Stuttgart land would never be the same: Tens of thousands demonstrated against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As was sealed, most hizó wing debris.
Broken at 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rugged soft stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, is 43.
Has secured a couple of pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"They should not disappear."
He enthuses: "A stone cheap and poor, simple and natural."
As he once said, has smelled the smoke of cigarettes.
Still do not know what to do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Gsell Uli too.
The trail of Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a previous tank ammunition from the French Navy, where he erected a stone Rongen Manuel Stein-Reich.
The man is 44 years old stones.
He has bought all the shares resulting from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would dishonor the gravel grind or sent to landfill," he says in his office, a small wooden house that was once a gatehouse.
Insulted and threatened him, he says, when, in September, appeared in the newspapers, which had bought the remains of the north wing to the demolition company.
He spoke with the enemies of 21S for several days.
And he said he could not do anything for the bombing.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable, when the stones remained in use.
About 200 enemies of S21 massif took 80 kilos of cut, with a price per bit from 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took as a souvenir but also with the hope of returning to a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half are still in the forest, the rest was sold long ago.
Own gardens, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and they took what they could be in the trunk and over.
Stuttgart stone long pulse that has become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"In reality, this stone is not anything special," said Rongen.
"If not for the political component."
Amounts to his SUV, makes a tour of his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, he interrupted his studies, and later biology, is interested in computers and finally works with stones.
And you love the stones.
Home to 4,000 tons of stone.
Transported its treasures throughout Germany.
He claims to be the largest dealer of ancient stones of the country.
Brakes.
In the snow there chopped sandstone rock art.
"It belongs to the Dresden bridge Marienbrücke" he explains.
Limestone dawn, yellow, warm, get excited.
"My dear stone."
The road through the forest.
Says a lot: red sandstone, above a piece of the station in Karlsruhe.
And continues.
"Beautiful travertine."
Formerly belonged to the rostrum Mazizo Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, rocks and stories, yellow travertine police headquarters in Stuttgart, red granite church Sankt Blasien, Heilbronner toba hospital.
What work, what effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thought of as sculpted by stone and moved with a simple rig and a cart, he is very devoted.
"It would be scandalous if something is destroyed."
There has been rich, absolutely filthy rich.
But today that 14 people were treating stones do, besides beds, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glazier and a gardener have been set up in the woods.
"We work hard, but satisfying," says the man who take care of the remains.
Soon have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to be rescued.
Fight for talent around big potential
Reina active influx at the buffet.
16 students crowd around the rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have been invited to a workshop for students of mechanical engineering and design.
In a contest of ideas, they have to talk about the car of the future VW workers and also learn all about Volkswagen.
And competing in the same way, many companies such as VW, meet in a melee near the best minds in collaboration with universities.
His mission: Hire as soon as possible to the most talented students of the universities, before entering the job market and are employed by others.
And as universities do not provide publications on the abilities of their students, we try to pry the exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
The second day of project Braunscheig Technical University, the consortium wins over talent.
A lady in the personnel department distributes pens, rubber bands and folders with the VW logo.
Explain to the excited young talent internship programs and jobs for students and shows them his ways in the consortium.
Nico Seal of the Technical University of Braunschweig leads the project with VW.
Sees advantages for both parties: "Students come in contact with industry and gain experience."
"At the same time, VW can meet students, observe more closely and consider them interesting candidates as potential future employees."
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are allowed so directly.
"The main point was previously in technical projects," says Seal.
The fight for fresh graduates is becoming harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If you do not have to advertise and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students in the engineering disciplines are in an excellent bargaining position.
According to the Association of German Engineers (VDI by its German acronym), in October there were 40,000 vacant posts of engineers.
And according to predictions for the VDI, this gap will grow even more engineers.
In the audit and advisory firm, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for headhunting.
Organizes procurement costly events, such as running KPMG, a type of modern treasure hunt in which participants must find their way through the GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight students to the U.S. promising the following year.
In addition, participants can see the branches of KPMG and learn about the company.
It decides who should be in two rounds of selection in the output.
Only the crème de la crème of many U.S. participants will
Universities are increasingly seeking to choose and polish to the high potential of universities as Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the crowd."
"The simple way alone we fell short."
For the scouts Dykta notes yield results.
"Until today we have a similar action in the past year with all participants."
"Some are nearing an end, and want to apply to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, also are on the hunt, especially small and medium-sized classic with job fairs.
"We try to get students in specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar" says Sitha Stübe, personnel responsible for solar technology manufacturer SolarWorld.
Bonner The company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems of the new generation.
Currently on the website of the company are 35 vacant posts.
"It's been very difficult to fill vacancies."
"It costs time and money," he says.
A shortest path is contact with the professors of the university.
Solarworld works with several colleges, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"Teachers can advise you to practice with us or make your thesis.
No expensive advertising campaigns are made for solar specialists.
So the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium usually can not offer," said Stübe, in charge of personnel.
In search of a job, money is no longer the most important.
The decisive factors are flexible work schedules, child care or good prospects for advancement.
A study by the Great Place to Work Instituts, holding the square Solarworld 55 among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute produces an annual list of the best providers of employment in Germany.
For what they ask the employee how satisfied you are with work and with the environment and observes the same pre-conditions of employees.
Stübe, the staff also hopes to charge extra points in their classification by their applicants to work.
"I think the applicant is set especially in external ratings of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of Employer Branding Deutschen Akademie advises companies who want a long-term strategy to gain a good reputation as employers.
Advises its customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, especially internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer goes through its own employees," he said.
In industry jargon is called internal employer branding, corporate identity promotion also within the template itself.
"A satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When it comes to good people and identify with the company, then get promotion directly to the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a game gang," said Kriegler.
Obama says new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico has not appeared in these years, no new oil drilling.
The U.S. government issued a strong ban and thus annulled their previous plans without appeal.
Also before the new drilling Atlantic coast remain closed for now.
This announced the interior minister, Ken Salazar said Wednesday.
What caused this strict prohibition, which will run at least the next five years is the explosion of the oil platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the blight that killed eleven workers and caused the greatest environmental catastrophe in the U.S., President Barack Obama admitted new drilling in the western Gulf of Mexico, under pressure from the opposition and the industry.
Supporters wanted to decrease U.S. dependence of new oil supplies from abroad.
To date it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable oil spill in the Gulf.
In the center of criticism is the British energy company BP, which is faced with millions of claims.
A commission of inquiry by Obama will present its findings in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the moratorium on drilling after the explosion.
Subsequently, other consortia peteroleros submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by using a tougher controls and a more stringent safety regulations.
Currently, the supervisory authority is responsible, after being accused of corruption charges has fallen into disrepute, reforms in the bud.
Obama announced in parallel which will close tax loopholes for-profit consortium of oil and gas.
The industry announced publicly that the total extraction in the Gulf will be lower due to stricter regulation, far.
"The government's plans are a major obstacle to the growth of the oil and gas," the result of the ongoing survey by consulting firm BDO - before the ban on mining on Wednesday.
Energey American Alliance complains about the insecurity in the sector: "Nobody knows what exactly to change the regulation."
Investment in new mining projects extend for one, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The river water is brown oil, smells like a gas station: Millions of gallons of crude oil spills have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People living from theft, corruption and illegal trade of oil.
A Akpobari Celestine in his eyes.
"Be not weary," environmental activist reassured reporters: "Today we will have enough oil in your eyes."
Nigeria's 37 years has managed to photograph children wading in chest deep water with the bright lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful sparkle of the water, the scene looks almost pretty.
You do not see that on the surface of oil floating brown spots.
Before prawns grabbed handfuls here says Esther Badom in the river Bodo-Jetty.
Meanwhile, the flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, poured into the wetland formidable an impressive amount of oil for a broken pipe.
Fish near the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach fish-filled waters: That, in the heart of the Niger Delta and situated in Ogoniland, is considered one of the world's smelliest regions.
In the path of travel of the river that runs through mangroves, the extensive devastation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat's engine removes a brown stock, who immerse their hands in the water, takes out a couple full of oil.
The roots of mangrove trees rising from the floor and dark licorice sticks, sadly isolate the palm trees that clash and hang their palms.
In vain seek the birds, as if they were in the wetland as ever: As the barrier is quiet exterior, expands on it a sort of ghostly quiet paradise smelling gas station earlier.
"What happens here is an ecological struggle," he says, haggard, Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
Comparison should war.
The settlement area of ​​the Ogoni is a battle fought for years: You broke more than 60 years ago the first European explorers, here was organized the first resistance in the 80's with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, executed later Here she had to put its first factory Shell consortium in 1993, it would be too dangerous for the employees of oil.
Even today it is forbidden to return to Ogoniland companies: While pumping more than two million daily barrels of black gold of the entire delta region, a size three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources and extraction 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every hundred feet of steel jutting platforms and quirky sculptures of water: "Christmas Trees" affectionately called the heads of the punches.
They have up to 50 years, most have a total corrosion.
Every minute a head failure, says Akpobari, then flowing a steady stream of oil into the water.
According to the estimations of experts, have poured more than two billion liters in 50 years in the ecosystem of the delta: Year after year, the amount of penetrating oil, such as the breakdown of the ship "Exxon Valdez 21 years ago Sea of ​​Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Who is responsible for the sustainable environmental region, will deal with it.
While the consortium of Shell and organized oil theft are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see the heads to be broken and leaking pipes as the main culprits.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applied normally low safety standards in the conventional world, scientist Richard Steiner criticized the consortium in 2008: Only defect rates of the pipes are "on a multiple higher than elsewhere."
In one place, which from a distance seems to be forgotten, there is a workshop full of oil under the open sky, figures emerge from the mangroves, are naked and covered in oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to the holes, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, flames a fire, a small refinery illegal.
In a barrel, oil is heated in the fire longer hours, says Michael, the head of the group.
First, the gas penetrates through the pipes in the vessel, later the oil pipeline leaks, and out diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees daily produce four barrels of 300 liters of diesel, "We bring 34,000 naira, about $ 22.
Delta inhabitants take advantage of the shortage of fuel in one of the largest black African oil states.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just 40 euros-cent per liter illegal heaters can offer even less: It reduces the value of their raw material.
Comes from "the bunkers," which tricks the pipeline that crosses Ogoniland: According to experts, this step will lose at least 16 million liters of oil per day across the Niger Delta.
Only an insignificant part of the raw material is refined stored provisional clearly illegal, organized criminal networks, which also belong to political and military officials, saved the best part in tanks and sell it cheaply in the global market.
The activist Akpobari considered purely academic debate over whether the environmental disaster is rather due to population management or loose way of production.
"If the oil did not behave as invasive and would not have completely destroyed the natural habitat of fish, would not sabotage or theft, or illegal refineries."
While the conditions of the Ogoni are destroyed mainly by Shell to the point that only shows a deduction of the partnership: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, like China."
Michael is nervous.
"It is high time that desaparezcáis" says Ölmann muscular.
"The soldiers can come at any minute."
If the special army unit to refiners take illegal, threatening them with arrest, if not a painful bribery.
Soldiers from the North also want, as all Nigerians to take advantage of the raw material.
"This invention has shattered condemned our whole country," says Akpobari.
The researchers detected dangerous factory defects A380 engine
Apparently, the A380 has a great security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, the researchers found a possible manufacturing defect that can cause "a catastrophic failure in the engine."
The airline Qantas wants to sue the manufacturer of the motor.
The passengers on the Qantas Airbus made an emergency landing in early November had much better luck than you can imagine: The Australian air safety authorities have received for research, a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 and warn of a possible manufacturing defect.
The potential defect has complicated implications: In a wired couplings, can cause fatigue cracks or crevices, the ATSB officials said in a report released Thursday.
This could have caused "catastrophic engine failure."
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among those is the Qantas, Airbus had to make an emergency landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The average Australian airline starts legal proceedings against the British turbine manufacturer.
Filed suit in federal court in Sydney that allowed more legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, head of Qantas, said his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the brand of motor parts and lost his wing is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that further testing of security for superjumbos equipped with affected engines.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, a spokesman for ATSB.
The security issue has become important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing gear Qantas, the airline kept its A380 fleet grounded for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines remained about three of his eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa said the engine of an A380 as a precaution.
This double-decker plane is the largest airliner in the world.
A nationwide Nevada causes traffic chaos
Germany completely white: From one day to another it has snowed in most of the country.
On many streets chaos, fail trains and airplanes.
At least three people were killed in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: In most of the country were reached during freezing temperatures Thursday night, what triggered the traffic chaos at many points.
In some parts of north and east, there is a snow cover of 15 centimeters thick.
The traffic is very limited on most highways and many streets.
In the A7 to Flensburg height, the snow is in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but not ready.
In addition, strong gusts of wind swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects tides with the water level 1.2 meters above its normal level on the coast of Schleswig-Holstein Baltic Sea.
In Saxony the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to the weather service Meteomedia, is called a red alert in Sächsische Schweiz, in reality the highest alert.
Here is part 30 inches of new snow and cold and strong winds are responsible for swirling.
There were trapped during the night many trucks and cars.
Also in Saxony Anhalt police authorities reported major riots in the streets.
In the A2, snow and wind and created paralyzed traffic jams.
In Thuringia snowfall affected the A4 and A9.
According to Deutsche Bahn, the expected major disruptions in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The snow on the road, fallen trees on the overhead rails or destroyed and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony the intercity service is suspended from Leipzig to Nuremberg.
In Saafeld, Thuringia ICE train had to stop trip to Munich.
Firefighters and rescue service attended the 165 passengers on the train with blankets, food and drink.
Snow winds sweep the streets.
In the largest German airport, winds with snow caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information center in Munich and cancellations have been announced.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokesman for Fraport and there are 40 flights canceled.
The plows are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stranded at the airport, despite that there are 400 camp beds prepared for them.
On many streets, on Wednesday afternoon and there were many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a crossing route in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
Near Nuremberg a similar accident occurred because of the snowy streets: Also here a truck was hit at an intersection of roads because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers on the train were injured, Bayreuth path to Nuremberg was blocked because of this morning.
Also a woman died 30 years later to overturn his car near Aschaffenburg in a slippery road.
Forecasters have good news: The snow will be increasingly soft, powdery and therefore gentle swirling gusts.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong winds and fast.
Undoubtedly continue to very cold in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deutsche Bank looks for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to leave his command: According to an article, the financial institution seeks buyer for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could provide up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank recently set up his headquarters: the twin towers were upgraded in the neighborhood of the banks in Frankfurt, while the bankers went back to their old workplace.
But now the syndicate apparently wants to take advantage reonvación costs, and looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as stated in the Financial Times Deutschland "based on a spokesperson.
The spokesman did not name the reasons for the planned sale.
"Always check whether to hold or sell the properties and then lease them back," he said.
So the biggest German lender to give back to the headquarters of his company after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros of investment from a fund house and then he made the arrangements.
Energy reforms figures reached approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
The experts in this field calculate the value of the towers of the famous newspaper as "Greentowers" at about 500 million euros.
Upon the sale of renovated buildings in a fund's bank or an independent investor has not been revealed today, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn the dead miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, for deaths that occurred after several explosions at a mine.
Have not yet been able to find the bodies, because security measures remain weak in the place of misfortune.
Two weeks ago there was an intense explosion in the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
Probe was introduced in place of misfortune, but found no sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue team was brought down for safety reasons.
Intense after the second blast, the authorities and experts deduced that there was no chance that the miners had survived.
No bodies have been recovered to date.
Today family and friends remember the deceased with a memorial.
Ten thousand people have changed over the radiant sunshine in Greymouth on New Zealand's South Island.
Silent for two minutes.
In honor of the miners buried, placed 29 tables with helmets, lamps and names of miners.
There were also photographs and personal items under clothing and surfboards.
Flags flew at half mast at government buildings in the country.
New Zealand expected the miners to return to the surface "of the depths of the earth," said John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, the participants of the commemoration.
"But he never came home."
You can not take the death of his son until he has seen his body, Lawrie said Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the prime minister and the families of the victims participated in the commemoration many foreign diplomats.
In the first explosion on November 19 were also buried miners from United Kingdom and South Africa.
Rescue workers extinguish a fire started inside a coal mine in the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been removed, the searing temperatures inside the mine will begin to shrink, said Gary Knowles, the senior police, told reporters.
Hell, soldier!
Is the gore fits the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn returns to explore the boundaries of genre with its epic battles "Valhalla Rising."
What the public must have thought the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn the film "Valhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior prisoner with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is released from their torturers and murders his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, it sounds ideal for young viewers seeking bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and boot to the guts of his enemies alive when their bodies in a bad mood.
Moreover, Unojo as actually called, it says almost no words throughout the film and the other characters are driven by at most one or two sentences or a couple of painful screaming death.
Otherwise shut up and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying hilly landscapes in Scotland, the racks offer the Viking world a thousand years ago.
Rather grown and ideal for filmmakers interested in existentialism and camera moves very calm.
When a movie has several groups of recipients is a shame that they can not exclude each other.
Winding Refn director considers its wild and styling trilogy drug dealer "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make their works for all audiences with a little more humor the mainstream or just under the brutality of artistic home.
A brain mass and a casing that spring can not deter most artistic movie fans.
Most action fans are dying of boredom, if Unojo take a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of missionaries cristioneros interpretable motivated violence and get stuck forever in the calm and the mist before your team gets to America and then shut up there.
It's a shame that "Valhalla Rising" did not find film distributor in Germany and published on DVD only.
It is a curse against the magnificent images, but also because, after the bloody presumptuous facade hides a piece of film at times exciting, it deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or action logic, everything is air, a feverish dream turned into a movie.
And so there is no escape for viewers.
Condede Refn is just a moment of relaxation and glaciers and the gloomy picture soundtrack of trance will make a lump in your throat, especially the incredible hatred that from the hearts of the characters goes to him.
Only a small blond girl who supports Unojo faithfully preserves something like innocence, all others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are not explained ever, at any time becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and allies interim ambassador possibly the devil himself.
He represents destruction, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Valhalla Rising" is a mysterious film to be hated and admired, to be angry, upset and surprised.
Experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA's nuclear energy organization has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this item until checks are permitted.
Midnight on 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli fighter jets F-15 I cubical building a mysterious attack in Syria.
Located on the banks of the Euphrates, the closest major city, 30 kilometers is Dair as-Saur.
His name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is about a reactor that the Syrians allegedly built with North Korean help in the bucket, in a hidden valley off the River.
According to information from foreign intelligence service of the U.S. the CIA in late April 2008, current reactor design under the name of the near-Kibar well suited for plutonium production, in which nuclear weapons are built.
In contrast, the technique just used for other purposes than those of the fifties.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite imagery.
Showed a computer animation where the components of the reactor were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model at Yongbyon nuclear plant.
Also shown photographs showing the building from nearby or from the inside.
It was shortly after the reactor was operational, he said, but was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years later the bombing, it's just known that at that time, the puzzles became larger with time.
The former U.S. president, George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack was totally confident that the Syrians had built a reactor in-Kibar, but hardly saw signs that the country has "a nuclear weapons program."
In Europe, several Secret Service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of an "alleged reactor," but considered "plausible" the filing of the CIA.
They lack solid evidence and the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to get ahead of a reactor, a senior UN diplomat said in the summer so lapidary that the IAEA has "sufficient material to take questions."
The Syrians very quickly got rid of the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and paved the way to consciousness.
However, in June 2008 a team from the IAEA under the leadership of former chief inspector Olli Heinonen Rastas found uranium-Kibar, which had been made by people.
Furthermore, the IAEA received satellite imagery of a member state, commercial vendors in the moments just after the attack, which should have a higher informative value of which presented the CIA.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown client, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
So the IAEA can not independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always hinted that he never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli guns, said Damaskus.
The IAEA rejected it as unlikely after the analysis of the particles.
Since then Damaskus refuses to discuss it, just as over satellite images.
In addition, drivers are prohibited from a second inspection in-Kibar and the entrance to the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also kept a strict silence.
"I never comment, Ehud Olmert, prime minister at the time of the attack, has recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case it has not worked since June 2008 and "gradually becomes a serious credibility problem for the authorities," a senior Western diplomat corresponds to a place on the IAEA in Vienna, is finally pending a serious offense against non-proliferation treaty of nuclear weapons, which blurs the IAEA.
The IAEA considers three teams as the key to progress in the clarification, which should be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others like them still exist.
Inspectors have not publicly released until which computers are treated, nor what their functions are, or if they seem suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA has designated as an intern at Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from the vicinity of the towns situated.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these locations and a complex of buildings located near Masyaf with satellite images, most likely a case of suspicious objects.
Possibly at or immediately adjacent to a military base, Syria bans on this occasion entry to the three places to the IAEA.
In Vienna, the Syrians are said to fear a U.S. record have asked the IAEA to spy on military facilities.
The nuclear detectives were warning on the teams thanks to warnings from the U.S. Secret Service
Using satellite photographs, the IAEA has evidence that material moves between the three sites and the hub on the banks of the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat in Vienna, a senior official said at least one team may be "related to fuel production."
But there is "no sign of sensitive activities, and enrichment of uranium or refurbishment; processes that are necessary to build nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with enriched uranium is not.
Where should come where uranium and plutonium must be separated later for pumps, for these are central questions in the best case, plausible assumptions.
Nor is there doubt about whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, found in three places.
As disappeared hundreds of truckloads of soil, no one has information on where to stay in the rubble.
The OIAE considered unlikely salt-mine Tibni, located in the few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which the Syrians admitted in 1998 for his skill as an area for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former inspector of the IAEA, related to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But photographs from orbit show that the Syrians made earthworks in the three cases suspected places large containers and removed after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be coincidence but it just helps to dispel the suspicion.
Furthermore, in the diplomatic sector is said that the IAEA has spent some months to develop a plan of inspections there, the Syrians allowed to maintain military secrecy as possible, only the display shows the magnitude of the interest of inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damaskus also criticized the proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago were reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the issue has no great urgency, since a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a type of U.S. Ambassador calls wields exceptional inspections, one of the most stringent nuclear Viennese authorities have to establish the controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, to be proposed by these investigations, has spoken of "a choice that I am open in the future," but still hesitates.
This road is very dangerous: This requires the majority of the board of governance of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented here are not exactly eager to escalate.
Moreover, as one diplomat mused: "What happens if the end did not find anything?"
Love in the Time of War
There are problems since Angelina Jolie began in the summer with the direction of his debut yet unnamed.
She wrote the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
Not much is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, falls in love with her rapist Serbs during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian Women's associations have protested quickly, which moved at the last moment a few days of shooting planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film was shot in Hungary and in post, but there are protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's organization of victims of war wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, told a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is an ambassador for the UN High Commissioner for refugees.
It is not diplomatic, Women weeks ago he was offered a meeting in Hungary rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
They do not love stories in the fields of rape, and Jolie's position about the victims reveals enough about the script.
His organization, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended dismissing as ambassador Jolie, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly Jolie has written for the scenes?
Bosnian culture ministry he read the script, awarded after a tug of war permit recording in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie was not yet.
The young author reiterates that it does not pursue political purposes with the film, is introduced with a lot of effort in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of war and give voice to all parties involved.
Its content is still unclear.
In the network runs a second synopsis of the movie that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the start of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, was deported to Serbia in the field he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different variant is the "victim of rape is love of torture."
Surely the Jolie film actually begins before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is "unjust and based on misinformation."
Can now make peace with Hollywood Hackers: While the script is still in the network illegally, like many others before.
Nothing as far away
This afternoon, finally returns to be good for the Irish.
No trace of grief
Instead, the home team dominates its customers in Sweden, Finland and the U.S.
The fans scream with joy as booming loud music, stamping feet.
The vibe in the club Bailey sudirlandés Cork, because the players are released, and find, pingpong balls at the cups of beer from a distance of three meters
The strange spectacle called "Beerpong" and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a plane ticket to Las Vegas for the World Championship in January beerpong.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this quirky set of discrete computer drinking and do not really hit it off.
And the boy of 26 years tries to have fun with it, distracted from the explosive question, what the future holds.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in his plans in January held a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
"It's far from home and I have yet to work there."
At least: Your girlfriend is waiting in Auckland, "a shot got her dream job as manager of events, it might be a good sign," says the boy and smiles.
Because of the poor prospects at home, two of the three brothers have already sought Tanners luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin currently works as IT consultant in London.
Young people go: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish left the country in the near future, experts predict economic and social research institute, ESRI, Dublin.
Until 2015, 200,000 immigrants have.
A great loss to this small country of only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, comes a wave of migration comparable to that experienced by the island in the eighties.
After a decade of progress that brought great comfort to the Irish, now extends melancholy.
Economic crisis confounds mostly young, well-trained Irish, for which up to now it's all uphill.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs to have money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under thirty years old are unemployed.
In the Irish Times letters to the editor are mass young migrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything is sinking."
"There should be an uprising against the politicians and bankers, but who can, and will lose our country and thus an entire generation."
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the union of Irish students go see a bleak future because the government only focuses on assembly and offers no prospects for young people.
"Reduce the minimum wage, but do not have strategies for new jobs," says 20 year old girl.
See how your peers are a few practices the following reumneradas.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to migrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to view this topic in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the WorkingAbroadExpo ," an exhibition that offers a service around the theme of working in abroad.
"For those starting to work abroad it is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your career," said the manager.
On its website displayed pictures of a guy surfing in Australia and other snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like it in the galley, but it brings freedom and fun.
For half a year, Seán O'Donovan knows how to build something else.
Since there was nothing to be done for the engineer of 29 years, currently works with 15 Irish partners in the construction in Germany.
Now up a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January is going to Hannover or Berlin, the next project.
O'Donovan sees his country only a few times because it works overtime to pay a credit to his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, as long the first time he stepped on the threshold of his home.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, which I am ever so well."
He laughs and goes a bit embarrassed by freezing rooms.
The small house is an elegant residential area with gardens to the houses, at the entrance are large and expensive cars parked.
O'Donovan bought the house with her sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, financed 100 percent credit.
"They were crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Are you afraid to fail with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, served over hot tea and says: "I have children who have to feed and I'm young, if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
Civil engineer does not like the complaints we often hear today.
"Nobody should go hungry, our situation is, by far, as dramatic as in the past here on the island," he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst that can happen, thus probably the first time we as Irish."
She laughs and tells about his father, the last major economic crisis was to England.
"After seven years he returned and life went on in Ireland, very simple."
A Tanner Cian likes these ideas.
Left open for the future and just see what life is like elsewhere.
And worked a couple of years in London and why they would not go well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But these days there is one thing that greatly restless: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
Fears it could degenerate into a farewell party.
"But not too much excitement," he says and takes a big swig from his beer.
"Farewell, sounds very distressing."
"Better call it a party to march, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
Democratic routine
Continued increase in support for democracy in Latin America, as well as support to private companies.
Crime generates greater concern than unemployment.
Moreover, much of the region, is seen as a country more influential than the United States.
Here are some of the conclusions of the latest survey of Latinobarómetro conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, allows to track changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October, there are two issues.
The first is relatively lively mood prevailing in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes toward democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in many countries of the Pacific coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% annually since 2002, support for democracy has risen from 40% in 2005 reduced to 61% this year.
Also expanded in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a big drop in production last year.
However, only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in his country, the same number as last year but considerably higher than 25% in 2001 (Chart 3).
About 34% said they trusted the U.S. Congress and 45% in its government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but significantly higher than in 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, the economic turmoil in Latin America seriously affected the support for democracy.
The fact that is sustained for the global financial crisis is probably due to many Latin American countries were affected only by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Furthermore, the existence of a social safety net stronger has helped to protect the poor.
(The Economic Commission for Latin America United Nations reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only marginally in 2009 and has fallen again this year, up 32%.)
However, the mood varies greatly from one country to another (see Figure 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
That sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and violent crime have increased.
For the second time since the survey began, more respondents mentioned crime in Latin America, rather than unemployment as the most serious problem facing their country (see Chart 5).
About 31% say either they or a close relative, a victim of crime in the past year, a figure that has fallen from 38% last year and is the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
More positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private enterprise and market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private companies are essential for development, while in 2007 it was only the 56% (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, compared with 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel the same way (and 80% support to private companies), although its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriated many private companies.
Brazil is the country that has a greater leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, same number as last year) and Venezuela (9% versus 11% a year).
However, U.S. is the country considered most influential by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela has that title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections in the trash
No one expected that the general elections held on November 28 in Haiti were perfect.
However, it took on a much worse than feared foreigners trying to help the country overcome its problems behind.
Votes were introduced at the polls, some people voted several times, ballots dumped in the sewers, schools destroyed and electoral intimidation.
Polling stations opened hours late.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the earthquake in January, roamed the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, claimed fraud and called for the annulment of the elections.
The protests, some violent, they spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the UN official senior in Haiti, said they were "relatively good elections in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said, cautiously, that "we believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate, Jude Celestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
Runoff is expected to be held in January.
Have not yet lost all hopes for the elections.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition requesting the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can arise even if the election authority declares that Mr. Celestin, who has little support, if any, has moved into the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic sweeping the country and more than one million earthquake survivors still living in tents, awaiting a high abstention.
Eventually, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity cards needed to vote, had not yet been circulated shortly before the election.
There is much at stake.
Aid donors believe that the election of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in rebuilding Haiti.
And, as has become evident, so believe the Haitians themselves.
Tiptoed toward the center
In the weeks that have elapsed since losing her husband, Cristina Fernandez, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed great sympathy among the public that has increased his popularity rating at 20 points, up over 50%, the highest level it has been since his election in 2007.
Nevertheless, you can make a successful campaign for a second term in elections next year will depend on whether Mrs. Johnson clearly affected leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, his predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, at this point, indications are not conclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who was taking charge of economic policy even after his wife succeed him as president, he used to develop budgets underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the additional revenue at its discretion.
In theory, the government of Mrs. Fernandez lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened following the death of Kirchner because of a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissenting members of the Peronist movement in power have dealt with Mrs. Johnson.
However, after a chaotic session in which a deputy punched another in the face and other deputies accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss," said the president.
The 2010 budget, therefore, be applied to next year, which give the president an even greater leeway when it comes to spending.
The economy is improving considerably, probably grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but numerous private estimates, in addition to the wage demands of unions, located about 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse led growth and poverty reduction priorities were, rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF pressured the private sector and made the INDEC, the statistical office, adapt official inflation statistics.
"Now the President Fernández will moderate policies?
Has convened meetings between the private sector and leaders of trade unions.
In addition, officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by high prices for Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the growth momentum achieved to a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason Mrs. Johnson is showing signs of wanting to restore the financial ties between Argentina and the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a forced restructuring of the debt after Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it appears that Mrs. Smith is about to conclude an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, which is about 6,700 million dollars.
The Kirchner always insisted that this would not imply the supervision of the IMF, as is customary.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Finance Minister announced that the Fund will provide "technical assistance" to develop a new price index for domestic consumption, which seems a prelude to clean the INDEC.
It is unclear if President Fernandez wants to continue in politics when his term ends, taking into account that no longer has her husband by her side.
If you do need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has grown tired of Kirchner.
When Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will be dropped.
If you want to win another election will have to decide whether to repudiate or not, with confidence, many of the policies of her husband.
Middle hooray for China
Voters in Taiwan are slowly approaching a sort of closer union with the mainland.
What do you think Taiwan on its big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those eligible, attended the November 27 to elect mayors and councilmen of five urban districts in what seems an extensive evaluation of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become an advocate for the feelings of the continent, forging innovative business linkages, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest changes in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma has passed the test, but just barely.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, failed to get the most votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has long advocated full independence for Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes compared to 45% of the KMT.
If they had been the president, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, the proportion of votes of his party has declined by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the municipalities.
In the elections could see the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including campaign noisy trucks and large crowds with flags and scantily clad dancing girls.
Not lacking the mysterious assassination attempt on rigor.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, KMT honorary chairman, was campaigning for a candidate of the KMT on the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young man straight in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The funny thing is that not possible to determine whether the man intended to harm or take revenge on the candidate Lien.
In any case, said Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicion about the PPD and causing voters are inclined to the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that this is not the subject of the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing schemes and job creation.
Taiwan typically enjoys de facto independence and hates the military threat from China.
Therefore, the KMT is usually avoid giving publicity to its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time also prevented PPD encouraging sentiment against China.
Responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
For his part, Mr. Ma said he had confirmed that its policy towards China was acceptable to most Taiwanese.
It is expected that the Beijing government continues to bribery for the trade in accordance with its strategy to ensure that Taiwan returns to the fold.
China lost no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Without doubt, also would like to get political, but first things first.
I'd better wait to spend the 2012 presidential election to do so.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned on charges of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, instigated openly express independence.
However, under the leadership of Ms. Tsai has emerged a new generation of moderates and the PDP is striving to attract young professionals.
Ms. Tsai has been greeted pleasantly as PDP candidate for the presidency, as well as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen mandate.
Now his party is doing everything possible to prove that they can have relations with Beijing.
Mrs. Tsai announced plans to establish a panel to act as an interface between the PDP and China, provided they can carry out negotiations without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai said the Taiwanese public that his party represents a "credible alternative" to precipitate Mr Ma approach towards China.
Mr. Chen seems angry about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, said the PDP candidates have fared better if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
Even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without intercede Mr. Chen, the DPP will have difficulty choosing among the possible candidates.
The KMT also must make an examination of conscience.
The reviews of Mr. Ma have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth of KMT candidates have refused to campaign with him.
His lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and a widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman said it will restructure his cabinet, as well as local teams.
Large samples of PPD suggest that the support of Taiwan to an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
Said Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "has already passed the point of no return."
Grammy nominations: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the New Artist category.
Acting at the request of a president and possibly people will notice you.
Esperanza Spalding, bassist and vocalist for 26 years personally selected by President Obama to act on their ceremony Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, represented one of the surprises of the Grammy nomination this year with a high level in the Best New Artist category.
Given that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Esperanza," the nomination sobering, but it respects the rules of the Grammys to the effect that an artist should be brought to market no more than recorded three albums before that "determines the public identity of that artist."
The ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society" undoubtedly was a breakthrough, and given its light and pleasant vocal style and great skill with influences from pop, funk and Latin rhythms, it can at least establish a distinction between Spalding and the road to the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent to the Grammy voters, who lately have been concentrated in the field of jazz for this category.
In other categories, the Grammy voters did rightly honor "Historicity" Vijay Iyer Trio, an exciting and magnificent album that was a favorite last year.
Iyer Among the competitors is the veteran saxophonist James Moody with Moody 4B and keyboardist John Beasley by "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a raucous New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on "Treme" the HBO was honored in the category of contemporary jazz that leans the other way towards fusion albums as Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild punk Darcy James Argue's Secret Society received a deserved recognition in the category of large groups, competing against the large chamber jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the ever dangerous Dave Holland, whose live album with his Octet, "Pathways" was a great example of democratic leadership of bassist in his band.

Temecula mosque proposal receives approval from the commission system
The Temecula mosque project has won the unanimous support of the local management committee after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project saying it encourages terrorism and traffic jams.
However, committee members decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center complied with local legislation and would be impressive from an aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews and Baha'is, of all religions," said Nael Hadi, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is that, as an American citizen, I am proud."
"It demonstrates that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"I just speak very high."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at six in the afternoon and lasted almost until midnight, most of the time was spent on people who interceded in favor or against the center, almost the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"America no longer exists," reads one comment.
"This is another planet of the apes with Ms. Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
Plans to build Islamic centers have sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near ground zero, New York area where the attacks occurred Sept. 11, 2011.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced violence.
His congregation of about 135 families spent years living together without problems in Riverside County, but wanted more space and better than the store you rented a property shared with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, include two minarets, and could rise to 43 feet.
Occupy an area of ​​4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the council.
A microbe resistant to arsenic raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth ... or elsewhere
The discovery of a rare bacterium that can use arsenic as one of their nutrients enhances the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although the researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say shows that there may be ways of life without the main elements considered essential.
"This organization has a dual capacity."
"You can grow either with phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes it something very peculiar, though some will take to be a kind of lifestyle really 'alien,'" said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, coauthor of the report appearing in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Has long been considered that there are six major elements essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, may continue to grow after replacing phosphorus by arsenic.
"It makes you ask yourself what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, coauthor of the report.
As indicated Anbar, the finding is important in the search for life on planets other than Earth, because researchers need to recognize the life, knowing how it looks.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the convening of a conference call to discuss, which were not disclosed details of the discovery generated a great deal of speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report indicate the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He did not.
What the discovery does show is that in other planetary environments, could have used other agencies to boost their biochemical elements and the set of elements "standard" that we consider essential to life may not be so fixed, "said Charles Cockell , Professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it shows the replacement of one element by another in the biochemistry and basic biochemical structure," said Cockell.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiology Institute of NASA, who led the study, focused on the Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from the chemical point of view, therefore speculated that a microbe exposure to them could substitute one for another.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"Consequently, it may be difficult to differentiate organisms."
"However, arsenic is different enough to not work as well as phosphorus, so go and, so to speak, the biochemical machinery cakes," says Anbar.
The researchers collected bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which could adapt and used to grow.
The germ grows best match, but the fact of proving that he can live with arsenic in place raises the possibility that naturally exist a way of life that use arsenic, either in other areas of the Earth or another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic can be substituted by the phosphor is not new, but had never found an example showing that it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early ages of Earth, he said, so the researchers speculated that the first life forms may have used.
"Yes, it suggests that there may be other ways of generating life, not just the way life once was on Earth," said Foster, who was not part of the research team of Wolfe-Simon.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
We found the stolen dogs missing from Compton
We found the two dogs missing from the four stolen in front of the motel Bellflower, according to sheriff's officials said County of Los Angeles on Thursday.
The four dogs in competition, two Akitas Pembroke Welsh Corgi and two disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express 2006 in which they were spending the night, compared to Bellflower Motel 6, as authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found on Wednesday, late night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department Los Angeles County.
"The good news is that dogs are good," said Whitmore.
"They are in good shape."
"They have returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say exactly where they found the dogs, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of discovery.
"We are conducting an investigation."
"We do not mean anything," said Whitmore.
"We are following some leads."
Could not find the owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, for that would make any comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to authorities, Akitas (Trace, a dog of 3 years, and Didi, a 10-month dog) had not been damaged.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Peek Rickard and competitions intended to exhibit in the area this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of the dogs were still missing as of Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the National Championship AKC / Eukanuba in Long Beach this weekend and had the intention of displaying a Trace.
The other dogs were going to exhibit in other competitions planned for the days before the championship AKC / Eukanuba, said Peek to The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the tour for almost two months that the couple made to participate in dog competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard made the check-in at the motel.
Normally stay in motels and the van parked just outside the window of his room.
They had three other dogs (a litter of boxer, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick coat and would be more fresh.
They left the windows open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van on Tuesday at six o'clock.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who might lead them to the Corgis, fitted with microchips for identification.
On Thursday it was unclear whether there would be a reward or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the restructuring of MGM gets the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally gotten the green light to start again.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York formally approved the plan "preassembled" by creditors to clear about 5 billion dollars of debt, paving the way for the entertainment company of 86 years to focus its efforts on the production and release of films and television programs.
The ruling on Thursday confirmed that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles that MGM is relaunched under the founder of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become executive principal of what will be a small study.
The staff was reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not exit Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase's credit close a planned $ 500 million to fund operations and new MGM productions.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the loan, which on its own is contributing $ 75 million and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise on the management necessary to manage their finances, as he struggled to make interest payments by $ 300 million per year .
In August, the Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former president of Enron and recovery expert bankrupt companies, known for his work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts to Moelis and Cooper to resolve financial troubles MGM and satisfy more than 140 creditors of the study, required more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, in late 2009 the parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and no one willing to pay more than U.S. $ 2 billion sought by creditors.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the drawing board at MGM as the team began working on a restructuring plan after months of debate and disagreements, was finally endorsed by the creditors in late October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, and Cooper Moelis companies receive multimillion-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $ 1.2 million, will get a payment of $ 9.5 million.
The Cooper Companies, which have been raising $ 375,000 per month for management services company, will receive a "success fee" of $ 4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one movie this year, and brought an annual slate of seven or eight films that come out in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit" along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to conclude a separate loan of between 265 and 275 million dollars to fund its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to arrange a merger of the studio Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to balance its budget for gifts
While IPAD is the frontrunner to be the most wonderful toy this year, followed by perhaps the video game system from Microsoft Kinect, both can make a significant dent in your budget for gifts.
Consider that for the price of an iPad can buy five $ 99 BMX bikes each, and a set Kinect costs the same as 10 classic jump rope beaded, or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, BJ's Wholesale Club to see what electronic toys could be purchased for under $ 80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law has been working, the technological toy this year is likely to have more power, costs the same and even a bit less compared to last year.
Moreover, while there are generally fewer new toys with partner sites, two of the best known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, are more tender.
And toys powered by button cells are increasing, and toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $ 13 for 3 years and over) are stuffed animals the size of a guinea pig to sing a note when you squeeze their bellies.
A grip is equivalent to a note, and a second grip began to make a song.
If you buy more than one, they sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start to tighten, can not stop.
To chant combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $ 60 for 2 years and over) is the best option.
Borrowing technology Elmo Live last year, the 14-inch animatronic doll play games Simóm shift change as he says, and can the moon step, thanks to its innovative foot articulated wheel locking device.
Children who tested the toy Mickey used as a dance instructor, although her parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80, can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has come back (Hasbro / Playskool, $ 40 for 3 years and over) with a backpack full of letters of questions designed to convert a drive in a session with a workbook witty self-correcting.
If you are wary of giving your child your smartphone, here econtrar three independent alternatives.
Mobiga VTech (60 dollars, 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a QWERTY keyboard, though the games do not teach as effectively as the Explorer Leapster (70 dollars, 3 to 12 years), is the first major overhaul of the Leapster line, with a shiny new screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
iXL Fisher-Price (90 dollars, from 3 to 7 years) using a system like iTunes to present games and electronic books, and has an SD card slot for displaying family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks slightly larger than a matchbox, each with its own LED display.
The aim is to build words by placing the blocks in a row before time runs out, is formidable competition armed impromptu words.
Are increasingly toys have some sort of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy her son a pet online in Club Penguin, for example, can get a Disney Club Penguin 2 "Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, (5 dollars, from 6 to 12 years) that includes a coin with a hidden code .
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credits on the Club Penguin shop for two items.
These could include skates or a toy pet Puffle.
Slightly larger than bristle brush your teeth, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars for 5 years and over) is the latest in a line of micro-robots driven by button cells.
The false insect moves rapidly over 12 feet of silicone vibrating in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the exit.
It is also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend some time inside the mouth of our dog.
It promotes a more moderate side of policing in China
As a drill sergeant urban Shenbin Tang paced in a square in the city, inspecting the nerve severely dependents, quietly issuing orders to military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan, the burly policemen China's urban agenda, feared and despised for its crackdown capricious and inclination to violence, communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Strong!"
"Attention!"
Show them whispered, "how are the pretty girls!"
Four girls who just passed adolescence with white gloves and olive green jackets and tight trousers identical to attract attention.
Four pairs of black shoes perfectly aligned.
Four elegant hats perfectly positioned above the hair tied with ribbons of blue and white stripes.
"Personally, I think they look normal," said Mr. Tang, disdainfully.
"The models are cute."
More than one government has tried to clean the image of China's urban inspectors.
A city ordered all new recruits have a college degree.
Guangdong Province changed the gray-green color to a blue uniforms supposedly more attractive.
Wuhan in central China, replaced the use of force by intimidating looks: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a shopping wayward snacks, and watched him, frowning steadily for half an hour, until the salesman packed up and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added to its urban police 13 women, specifically chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give crude police a softer side, female.
Unfortunately, so Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase the minimal respect for China for these squads in the city.
And for good reason, critics argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors from the Hubei Province was beaten to death a passerby after he used his phone to film them dissolved a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for inspectors in Beijing was stolen and posted online, where flogging was described as effectively with offenders, they bled.
This year, a vendor of watermelons from Shanghai suffered brain damage after a fight with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available for download online, presented by the Chinese inspectors trained to attack street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a scar on the government," lamented China Daily, a national publication last year after another dispute over tactics.
The newspaper called "a really thorough cleaning."
Skeptics say that the present approach is far from this.
After the district requested by a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered whether women had real duties or were simply a distraction stage.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The notice called for female candidates district 18 to 22 years with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features."
Should have a height above the average, more than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
The retirement age of 26 years is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too hard for women over 25 years.
"His image is the important thing," said an anonymous official Rednet.com district, a quasi-governmental web site.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates determine if they meet requirements such as height, weight, facial features, etc.."
Then comes the temperament and inner qualities. "
The women are like vases chengguan said, adding, "besides being vases, have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the administration office of the district town, is not eager to support this description.
But he noted that the height requirements were standard in many Chinese job postings for both sexes.
Then comes the need for harmonious facial features.
If this means being handsome, is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not arise.
"We can not allow a person or a hunchback take working here," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image would not be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Plaza Baoguang near a monastery, has 22 years, with their red cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She does not believe that the emphasis on appearance is sexist, he said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a wry look.
His co-worker with dimples, Xu Yang, 21, said: "Our work must present the image of the city."
They do not preclude work on time given, they said, because they harbor higher career aspirations than simply scare off vendors from the streets where they are supposed to restrict their business.
Each morning, the squad is facing about a dozen vendors that are released by foot or bicycle, trying to sell as many rolls or bowls of tofu as possible before being thrown.
"Mr. Wang, has to leave."
"We've said many times!" Ms. Xu said as a seller escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning their bike chariot fittings noodles.
The officers described their duties as more stressful monotonous.
"This is more or less the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, 20, who studied marketing in their spare time.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers have no power of their male counterparts to seize the goods from vendors.
They can only threaten to report violators to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against the bureaucracy, which are common in all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan's provincial capital, rioted after they were spreading the false rumor that some officers had killed chengguan a seller.
More than a dozen police officers or officers were injured chengguan night's episode, 14 government vehicles were overturned and set on fire.
At the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But the calm is hardly guaranteed.
Only two blocks from the tranquil Plaza Baoguang, where female officers patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
The officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a garage, as required by regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle shouted rudely.
The situation came to a standstill for 15 minutes before the officers, with a face, the way to the elbows opened up their vehicles and were faster with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the squadron men, remained behind with his badge turned white to hide your name.
Because female officers, coordinators, men 40 years or more, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught how to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li-factly.
"Most of the time is the public who starts the fight."
Prosecutors will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
The senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have Senator John Ensign acquitted of criminal charges stemming from her affair with a former campaign aide and his efforts to secure work by lobbying for the woman's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered as a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2012, until the scandal over his affair had made national headlines last year and hurt his career.
Ensign's office said he was "certainly pleased" by the decision, which came after an investigation of an entire year.
The senator could still face disciplinary action from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department we had "informed that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of its investigation and has no plan to raise charges against him for this."
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Department of Justice, which said they appeared to have significant evidence to indicate that Ensign could have conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
The interviews, email and other documents that were released first in October 2009 in the New York Times reported that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his aides, to obtain lucrative work through lobbying, to achieve Silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a campaign treasurer Ensign.
Ensign made contact with several political supporters to find work to Mr. Hampton and advocated on behalf of them after Mr. Hampton had been hired to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton was recently an assistant Ensign, was barred by law from lobbying for their former employer or the Senate for one year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared at odds with the "revolving door lobbying ban," which seeks to restrict former government employees use their connections for personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, "seemed to be a prima facie case of conspiracy to violate the statute substantially revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients under investigation by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics advocates said the department seemed wary of accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for section public integrity, including last year's decision to abandon the prosecution of former Senator Ted Stevens, amid charges of misconduct proceedings.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that government officials of high rank can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," he said.
Paul Coggins, the lead lawyer for Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another call over the next day, saying that the department did not want to press charges against his client.
The Ensign defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins declined to explain in detail the legal arguments that gave the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we who took the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change research in a separate complaint by the ethics group, which claims that a payment of $ 96,000 to the parents of Ensign to Hampton violated federal election law.
The electoral commission said it had enough evidence to prove that the money was a gift.
NV Energy is a leading company in Nevada that had long supported the senator, who got a job through with the aid lobby that gave Ensign Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company agreed to Hampton as a lobbyist, the chief of staff Ensign, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and said he was "crushing" the Ministry of Interior on a point in dispute.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another client of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and called on the Secretary of Transportation to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after Hampton was hired to lobby.
When I first came news of the affair last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth leading Republican in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When the spokesman for Ensign, Jennifer Cooper, Ensign announced that he was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, said the senator hoped the Ethics Committee quickly follow the example of the Justice Department concluded its investigation.
"Senator Ensign has a desire to continue their hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal point to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chat" in the rows of the courtroom.
Minute by minute reports of gruesome testimony sent via Twitter.
In the end, says the defense, had over 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and children strapped to their beds in a house that was set ablaze.
On Thursday, the process widely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted for the murder of three members of a family of Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to come to an official end with the judge's imposition of the death penalty passed by the jury.
But lawyers for Mr. Hayes has submitted written to the court outlining the arguments of the appeals that are likely occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the extensive reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by the journalists of mass media, created a "circus atmosphere" and such widespread and immediate saturation with details enhancers made public passions exert inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could require appellate judges to grapple with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in court.
"According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the rights of individuals to have a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lead attorney for the defense of Mr. Hayes.
The trial judge Jon C. Blue, of State Superior Court, curtly rejected claims in a ruling last week, saying the news media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury has been led by passion.
But probably not the last word on the subject.
For decades, appellate courts have recognized that the coverage of celebrated cases may raise questions about the fairness of a process.
In a landmark ruling in 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision in the Sheppard case vs. Maxwell, who had "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the TV show and movie "The Fugitive."
Some lawyers said the appeals court reviewed the conviction of Mr. Hayes half a century later, might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from the courtroom, at the time something inimaginadable Dr. Sheppard case.
"There is a general concern about the impact of new media" in the process of high profile, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report stating that it was imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting the immediate communication from the courtroom could make them more fair trials.
The question of Twitter is just one of many of the issues outlined by the attorneys of Hayes, which will probably be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
The defense lawyers also say, for example, that Hayes might have been prejudiced when the judge refused to allow Blue to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing grisly photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
The defense lawyers say they also question the constitutionality of the death penalty, arguing that the judge improperly removed a juror who had criticized prosecutors, and had improperly pressed for a verdict in his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate for a weekend.
Jurors were not sequestered.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract the most interest.
They watched the verdict on a challenge filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign for candidates for governor and U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually poured fuel on the fire of emotion on the case.
"The metropolitan daily tweets of media cameras and reporters outside the court," attorneys wrote, "was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps the entire state."
Attention on the Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In interviews, journalists said the complaint about the fact that the news was more important than immediate reports delivered more slowly, were a Luddite view that would make the court's policy on the control of the coverage is weak in future processes .
But some lawyers said the appellate courts often attracted by the arguments on adaptation that was required in court due to social and technological changes.
Hayes's lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In its statement, referred to the 1966 decision of the Supreme Court, which overturned the conviction of Dr. Sheppard due to coverage of the process and made it clear they would require that new media require new rules.
"This case" they wrote, "represents the Sheppard case vs. Maxwell XXI century."
Is citizenship a bridge to unite the divisions?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, this week has triggered a bit of civility in Washington.
Is it a harbinger of future bipartisan cooperation genuine or illusory time before a quick return to partisan fighting in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on the major issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But by all accounts, was at least a short discussion about the differences between the two parties and a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode partisan gap to score points.
The public meeting on Wednesday, the commission president's deficit was equally civilized, despite the political differences that exist among members.
It seems clear that the close interaction over a period of months led to a mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide that still separates the members.
That is barely enough to declare that it has reached a new era of cooperation.
Now both parties are in a probationary period, probing each other for signs of cooperativeness and commitment, while trying to test the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters for a renewed partisan war.
Why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent evaluations by the same participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deeply ingrained as to suggest any rapid change of climate that existed during the past two years.
Whether it comes to taxes, spending, health care or social assistance, the two parties are poles apart.
However, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed regarding the mode of saying things," said Pete Wehner, an official of the Bush administration now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions, which then become extinct.
That's good. "
On some issues, particularly those contained in the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
The Bush tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and nobody is in favor of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions on a permanent or temporary.
Similarly, it is likely to be a commitment to extend unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans can not believe they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, there is greater optimism about a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, with the ratification of the new nuclear disarmament pact START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston, Brookings Institution, warns that successful cooperation on pressing issues of the outgoing session not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th. Congress convenes in January.
Said, however, it is very likely and even inevitable, to begin a period of disagreement.
"After that things should be done are carried out in the short term the situation will reverse the psychology of confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) to the fact that citizenship can lead to real cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and Tea Party voters, who were instrumental to its creation.
For more aware with Republican leaders about the dangers of overstating their position, know they must try to fulfill their promises to cut state spending and cancel the new health law.
These party lines and are clearly visible in the initial reaction to the recommendations of the commission of deficits, which include reforming the tax code and increasing some taxes and the retirement age, and cutting costs.
The co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been responsible for one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, by his own assessment, have been introduced to force the issue of deficit in the public agenda in a way that can not be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to publish the plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get near that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials on the panel, suggesting that there are tax issues, at least at present, few bases or desire to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republican White House and Congress.
The first will happen next year as supporters crash, when the Republicans to challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and health care, followed then by a further period of bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as happened in 1995, then both parties carefully observe the reaction of the people.
Anyone who believe that losing is likely to change course and seek compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic view.
The partisanship and polarization are higher now than they were in mid-1990, and seems to have a larger ideological gap between Obama and the congressional Republicans who had between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists in both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a most momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort from both sides to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
A leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is held by a "kleptocracy," and let some of the bribes and protection money it collects directly to the Kremlin, said in February the U.S. Embassy in Russia.
It was reported that both the police and Federal Security Service handle huge systems of blackmail, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only legitimate businesses but also by organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical authority" takes its money as they climb the ladder.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
Was written while he was still Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed him in October, but there has been little evidence of a clean since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, which owns a major construction company, have consistently denied corruption allegations over the years, and he has won several lawsuits for libel over such allegations.
In September, when a Russian television station asked him about a documentary that suggested he was corrupt, said: "It's crazy, a hoax, a nuisance."
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details spelled out, as they were in the report of the embassy, ​​and it is outrageous that they are the diplomats of a foreign country that do that.
"The direct links to the city government of Moscow in the crime have led some to call it 'dysfunctional', and claims that the government functions more as a kleptocracy that as a government," says the note.
"The criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia which literally means" roof "or protection) that pass through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office and all sectors of government bureaucracy in the city of Moscow.
"The analysts identify a structure of three levels in the Moscow criminal underworld."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the military are on the second level."
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups are filling a void in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS collects the money from larger companies, and that the police aimed at small businesses.
A source said the report, "said the Moscow business owners understand that the best protection is to MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power criminal groups, but are also protected by law. "
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The memo notes that, while the fundraising is complete, protection may be irregular, even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly found their businesses closed for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times on the fight against corruption, but has admitted he has made little progress.
The Embassy memo reports on men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, within the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of the expert group Inde in Moscow in a recent interview.
"But he is a part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no political class in Russia."
Without the policy, without opposition, without a separation of powers, said, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, Indem estimated that corruption costs to Russia more than 300 billion dollars per year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption conducted by the nongovernmental organization Transparency International, the country was classified in the post 154 (the countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the note by the U.S. Embassy, ​​which did not occur until late at night Moscow time, is likely to cause annoyance within the Russian government, and despite Luzhkov can be blamed for the weaknesses of Moscow, could be an opportunity for argue that the Kremlin are troubleshooting the problem.
Interviewed on CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation that U.S. diplomats said that they called Batman and Robin Medvedev.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, do not suspect that this would have done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, it was done in a manner so immoral."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit concrete room with stained and peeling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School remembered the man who had built, the last Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"We all love Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and cared for his people," said Ma Kor Sreng, 42.
Known as "the Butcher" for his brutality during the reign of the Khmer Rouge commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where they still live thousands of former soldiers of the organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, the long-held allegiance is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for the Truth and Reconciliation enabled victims who publicly clashed with those who had participated in the scheme.
In June, the government distributed here a textbook high school who first taught the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of his former soldiers.
And in July, a mixed tribunal of the United Nations and Cambodia issued the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentencing the former head of the famous torture center Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years imprisonment.
With each of these events has increased anxiety among veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among former Khmer Rouge, but can not do anything," said Youk Chhang, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is creating divisions within families."
During the rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork, some 1.7 million people.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government led by Pol Pot, the remains of his military regime and fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
They launched an insurrection that lasted until the last move he surrendered in December 1998.
Like Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok in Anlong Veng followers grew.
But in the mid 90's, after a peace agreement sponsored by the UN led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of fighters of the Khmer Rouge began to defect to the government, culminating in the rendering of Ieng Sary in 1996, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had resisted, he was captured by government forces in 1999 in nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while waiting for the process.
Without the support of its benefactors, the oldest of the Khmer Rouge fighters fell into abject poverty that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
While a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge retained their local administrative positions in exchange for giving up their weapons, the privates are still poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have benefited little after the surrender," said Sok Leang the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which provides public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They have built agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised without any grounds for doing business."
Lim Sr., 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before turning to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Khmer Rouge was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok gave food to everyone."
"But now life is difficult because we have self-sufficient."
The current of the Khmer Rouge tribunal has also caused worries here.
Early next year, is expected to begin processing the court to Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife Ieng Tirith, another former minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The mandate of the tribunal is to prosecute senior leaders and those most responsible for crimes, but has not said whether he will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This is not done much to allay fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Chaem Im, 64, who was a district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the late 1970's.
In 2007, she told investigators of the Documentation Center of Cambodia who had supervised the construction of Thma Trapeang Dam, a project which is thought to have killed thousands of forced laborers.
During a recent sultry afternoon, Im Chaem returned to work in the fields to his house on stilts on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows on the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She said that if the court convened not stand.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," he said.
"If there are more indictments, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, but experts and historians question.
"Cambodia should dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But dealing with the past is just what Cambodia should do to move forward, "said Youk Chhang, the documentation center.
"Reconciliation, as Khmer, is to reunite the broken pieces" he said.
"It is our obligation to meet these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The center produced the first textbook approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea," 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the textbook story of high school by the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
Like most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng knows few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's link with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are unsure about the number of people who process the court."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process is complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge kept a powerful spell.
In Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black soot covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a seller of cell phones by the roadside, said he did not know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray," he said.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea, and later that day decided to walk the last resting place of Pol Pot, where would a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of good luck.
Belarus agrees to forego uranium reserves qualified for weapons
In a surprise victory for the Obama campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it give up its reserves of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement issued after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up their highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a tipping point last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that took place a few classified operations with Belarus in the past two months, to remove 84.82 kg of uranium weapons qualified for a research facility in Belarus.
This paved the way for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the remaining material, approximately 227 kg, according to one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the Summit of the 47-nation Nuclear Security chaired by Obama in April, which ruled Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I really was fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place in the Nuclear Safety Summit 2012."
"This shows that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said the agreement is "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009 in Prague Obama promised to protect all vulnerable nuclear materials worldwide within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has assisted six countries to get rid of all the highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Nuclear Safety Summit Obama, President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have retained the highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically qualified uranium for weapons) and low-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material ... not going to make dirty bombs, and we will not sell to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, is all."
Belarus, however, came to the United States earlier this year, indicating an interest in reaching an agreement.
The officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus, in October, was particularly complicated because the material had been lightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled over 2,000 miles at a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation was completed on Monday and was made by plane.
The U.S. government spent $ 13 million for tasks, and most of the money was used to supply to Belarus the research facility in uranium enrichment, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official who works in the Global Threat Reduction, said: "This was coordinated and carefully orchestrated to build confidence" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of uranium for weapons qualified, and hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate the reservation by 2012, according to the joint statement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to the harsh repression of human rights Lukashenko.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential strain.
It was stated that "while welcoming the progress on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and essential for the progress of the country and its citizens. "
The Spanish government did not object to the CIA flights
The Spanish government did not object to the CIA flights carrying prisoners Taliban and Al Qaeda in the direction of Guantanamo Spanish territory, as expressed in a telegram to the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This is reflected in the leaked documents (cables) by Wikileaks daily El Pais, which adds that the then Deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega, asked the Spanish government was reported to "be able to show that exercising appropriate oversight on foreign planes passing through Spain. "
In June 2006, following a report of the Council of Europe in which he accused of complicity in anti-human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, there was a meeting between former U.S. ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vega.
The vice president acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Government of Zapatero offside" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega said that Spain has no qualms about intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "caught off guard," says Aguirre in a cable.
Also the then Foreign Minister, Miguel Angel Moratinos said the Spanish ambassador that the government "wanted to give this issue the lowest profile possible, though, to be in the hands of judges, the Government had limited influence."
For its part, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vincent Gonzalez sent the embassy would not try to block the initiative of the judge to order the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on the flight CIA.
"These reports contain no incriminating nor any sensitive information," said the Embassy after talking with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. showed its concern about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors, rather than the CNI or declassified information from the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers complicate our efforts to handle the case quietly between governments," laments Aguirre.
In March 2007, at a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and the Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, he told him that "although the Spanish judges are fiercely jealous of their independence and do what they consider appropriate," he had instructed his staff "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The ambassador also expressed concern about the performance of the PP in this case.
"Despite his pro-American general guidance, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or knowingly ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as a possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. government, "he says.

Popular gain 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the CP could be crucial in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the large increase in votes and MPs experienced in recent regional elections, the Catalan PP already has his sights set on the general then has lead or not, the outlook is more positive as the number of votes they get this training in these elections tends to turn the receiver on the Catalans.
Thus, the Catalans won 610,473 popular votes in 2008 general while in the regional elections of 2006, the figure rose to 316,222.
On Sunday, the CPP achieved 384,091 votes.
To keep this upward trend, which has been nurtured by a transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, the training analysts have calculated that, if held general elections, the CPP could spend 8 to 12 Members in Congress, while CiU also win four (now 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 members (has 25).
These calculations would note that the square is essential Catalan PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of popular, ERC lose an MP - now three - while ICV would get a deputy or a win.
But, to keep the electoral calendar, the most immediate appointment will be in May 2011 municipal elections, where folk can also be decisive in ending the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in his relief at the head of Barcelona Provincial Council, a government that runs over budget - 661 million euros for 2011 -.
Popular national and agree on the possibility that the PSC lost the cities of Barcelona, ​​Tarragona, Lleida and Girona, where the Socialists most do not get recourse to its traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle would not be unreasonable for such training to lose their representation in the Consistory of Barcelona - is needed to obtain 5% of the votes -.
The PP has increased its votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, ​​Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to star in the turnaround in the capital of Tarragona, where he ruled with the PP before the current Socialist mayor, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP is located only 500 votes of the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, has very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, met on several occasions.
Have grown popular in other major towns as Badalona, ​​Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and is seeking to form lists the maximum number of populations.
Cell Catalan provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, ​​in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian arrested by agents of the Commissioner General of Police Information in Barcelona were a jihadist cell that led from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups of Al Qaida, including "The Liberation Tigers of Earth Tamil (LTTE) and Laskar-e-Taiba (LeT), the latter author of the Bombay bombings that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Home Office has attached great importance to this research, to the point of ensuring that the "operation Kampai" has been "weakened" the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaeda worldwide and, "therefore, their operational capability."
The researchers calculated that the cell in the two years he has been active in Catalonia, has been sending thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to the galaxy groups in the criminal Al Qaeda for their "fighters" can cross borders in Europe and other Western countries with impunity.
Destamantelada cell is not the only jihadist network that was operational in Europe, which is why the investigations have been involved, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so it is possible that the EU territory are carried out in the coming days similar to that developed shock on Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In conjunction with this transaction (the Pakistanis were arrested Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabra Asghar, Iftikhar Ahmad Malik, Mohammad Saddique Begum Khan, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Agunbiade Babatunde), Thailand was developed to capture other Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Ehsan Butt Zeeshan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the way from Bangkok cell based in Spain and other European countries.
Catalan network - part of it was struck in 2009 - mainly to tourists stealing passports that met the requirements set by the so-called "World Islamic Front."
That is, the documents should be made payable to males between 25 and 45, valid for several years without visas stamped.
In media research highlights that, for now, has not found any evidence linking those arrested in Catalonia with the Bombay bombings, although the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba, has been a groups receiving stolen passports in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that days before he was committed this attack, from Catalonia were sent through a wire transfer a few thousand dollars were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards were then used by members of " command "that claimed the lives of 106 people.
Police have seized well documented.
The PP requires Mas fiscal park concert
The PPP leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had occasion yesterday Artur Mas personally expose their position to support his inauguration as President of the Generalitat, identical to those raised during the campaign and summarized to give priority to recovery economic and philosophical adventure without sovereign, as is the economic agreement that the nationalist leader wanted to raise in Ecuador of its mandate.
The president of the popular Catalan attended the meeting of Artur Mas with the security that having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a figure more than enough to be loved, because the CiU candidate needs at least one of the formations will hold the opposition to refrain in the investiture vote.
Of a possible entente with the PP depend future alliances that nationalists want to keep in Congress when general elections, but for now, the conversations these days keeps But with the other political leaders are key in Catalan.
And in regard to the president of the PP, to support an endowment "will have to park all the speeches sovereign and independence" and the economic agreement - similar to the Basque Country - the leading convergent aims to even submit to referendum.

The nursing home says the deaths were not due to "lack of action"
The owners of the center of Olot not rule out that the guard killed more than 11 elderly
The makers of geriatric Caritat Olot (Girona) gave a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage he has caused to the institution of criminal conduct Dilmé Joan Vila, the nurse while employed there killed at least eleven elders who was responsible.
The manager of the home, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by counsel for the center, the attorney Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire to be able to exercise the Caritat charges against the responsible" for the deaths but "the legality and responsibility we forced to take the procedural status of civil responsibility. "
It is also of social prestige may suffer the institution for failing to detect any criminal activities of the caretaker, the greatest threat to the Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation are already calculating the legal representatives of the families of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime goes back to August 2009 and since then has continued to kill.
The judge said in the car and ordering the exhumation of eight bodies - old geriatric patients - who suspected that in many cases no doctor explored the deceased person but, according to age and the pathologies of patients, was dispatched on Step by phone.
The Caritat, through its director, flatly denied yesterday that point and noted that "the lack of action could not have been at any time the cause of what happened."
The Caritat's lawyer added that "in the case not a single indication that there was a reckless action by any person other than the accused himself."
The now named "Angel of Death" yesterday admitted 11 murders and explained that the first crime was committed on 29 August 2009 for a month and a half later, killing a second grandmother.
In this case poking killed an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime that was committed in a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of The Caritat suggested that it is difficult to control center personnel have access to medicines.
Puncture of insulin and the cocktail of sedatives have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that nurses, in an effort to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used for killing.
But tests are being made in the laboratory to be clarified whether Vila does not lie and looked for their first victims a death less cruel or whether, on the contrary, burned inside them has already confessed bleach as it did the three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In The Caritat not give credence to the statements of the caretaker, or even the number of murders confessed, they do not rule that is superior, and justify their attitude in the different versions Vila has been on visits to the court and in the limited sense you have to change their procedures after having committed, successful, eight murders.
That's why they say they are made available to the court to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threat
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat yesterday, Trichet warned of "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
Peripheral differentials have closed tightly and European bank stocks have risen more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the ability of the ECB and the euro little mistake has picked up which is a worrying sign.
What occurred yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that collapses like recovering but motivated by closing short positions and highly speculative.
The institutional investor will take to lose the fear.
A month ago we cited today the ECB to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to take back tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
The Bundesbank demanded complete the purchase plan as ineffective public debt and eliminating all extraordinary liquidity measures forward and leaving only a week unlimited access.
Irish hope after the crisis to prolong the current liquidity measures "at least until March," and maintain the quarterly auction unlimited access to the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope to continue with its program of buying bonds and even giving the sign of intensifying.
If you do not meet the expectations generated excellent reverse the market reaction yesterday and if they are blinded to withdraw liquidity measures, God help us!
As in its May meeting in which they affirmed that they had not seen the purchase of bonds and the markets collapsed, tomorrow could repeat history.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May announced the bazooka on Monday and Wednesday said it had bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday's auction of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury just issued 500 million 5.28%, versus 750 million 4.81% on the previous auction.
Yet rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, has made public the figures hole and Allied Bank of Ireland.
The estimates are about 10,000 million and 15,000 other short-term prospects and have until February to raise private capital or be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumed within the Support Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval for its new budget and do not have enough support, so that Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of his speech to ease tensions ahead of the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which political commitment is needed to show that we are a union and they all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest of the Ode to Joy by Beethoven.
In Spain, the president had the gift of the opportunity yesterday to present the plan of measures adopted on Friday, the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, deregulation, privatization, measures to boost employment ringing in the ears of investors such as Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The dual effect and ZP Trichet said that the Spanish stock market has risen 4.5%, double the other European exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and decisive and we are benefiting of surprise.
Today is a key auction of a three-year bond will benefit from the effect of what we expect Trichet to be resolved with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
For Spain to ask for a Relief Plan would be a self-immolation.
We give a liquidity do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in available liquidity triple that in March, expensive rates and will close access to markets indefinitely.
However, the strategy should be that of Caesar's wife, "as well as be, seem so."
Spirit, we can.

Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon Siemens
Software enhancements designed cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this exclusive world of speed has been marked by the surprise and success.
At first no one took into account the options of a team just arrived and, despite the upward trend in recent seasons, last November, in the final championship win bet on all of Ferrari's Fernando Alonso.
Without detracting from the ability as a pilot last champion, Germany's Sebastian Vettel, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that powers his car in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend in the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens placed in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that Germany put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from high racing.
Called PLM, this powerful software tool has been used to design assembly lines for manufacturing plants worldwide, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce faithfully simulate the product or process before it is built in real mode, thus preventing failures and unnecessary expenditure.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, the Sukhoi aircraft or the most famous small cars for Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, says the use of this software tool at its factory in Formula 1 Red Bull has allowed to design and carry out "within hours, almost in real time, changes, changes and improvements that are detected during the races and tests.
Russwurm says that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in her team were able to enter up to three or four vehicles improved each season.
In the Red Bull team work today 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computers, analyze and project all sorts of modifications to the cars.
The manager explained that Siemens PLM software can analyze and improve all elements of the Red Bull racing cars except the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
Are modified materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features.
The changes can be virtual reality simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced production laser systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation to this madness of technological upgrading is the figure of $ 40 million each Formula 1 team can spend up each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set the high-tech factory to design and produce their cars in a town about 50 miles from London.
These two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that occurs there is considered "top secret."
The template for this purpose amounts to 580 people, including the two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Red Bull Formula 1, without doubt, is the latest champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the vast technological resources that the energy drink brand has been in the service of their participation in the circuits, hide other players whose help is invaluable and zero visibility.
The chief technology officer at the factory, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago you could say that the R & D progress in wagons cars contributed 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the remainder.
Today, these percentages have changed and technology plus 85% of success, as the drivers, contributing 15% of value added.
Nevey recognizes that Vettel and Webber will never be replaced by computers because "they are gladiators unpredictable."
HP installed in two years 20 owned stores to local dealers
Hewlett-Packard (HP) today opened its first store in Barcelona exclusive partner collaboration are Pont Reyes.
This is the first of a network of 20 stores from 80 to 100 square meters that the multinational plan to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will ensure the compatibility of this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-centers as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Ingles.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, pointed to the remodeled store located in the Gran Via Avenue, owned by Pont Reyes, who has worked for 30 years.
The American group has prepared a plan to place 200 branded outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish settlements.

The director also said that HP's personal systems to install the shopping philosophy is always the same, relying on a local dealer with experience and industry knowledge.
The U.S. group advises and is responsible for designing unique furniture stores (with products that can be played interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
HP also covers staff training establishments.
Helena Smith denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of businesses aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in the purchase, care, after-sales and even the packaging."
Barcelona shop includes a space with a pilot program a global pioneer in charge of solving possible problems with HP hardware warranty.
An online service connects to a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"Thus, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical assistance services," he said yesterday Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bid to 'steal' a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, the CEO of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for banks, but initially ruled a new liquidity crisis brought an end to the war in person.
Nevertheless provides a slump in interest margins, which try to compensate in part to increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to attract over three years a million customers, its unfinished business.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very difficult economic environment.
The bank will launch in 2011 a new plan that will run for three years.
The aim, in addition to survive without resorting to public assistance FROB is winning market share with the capture of one million new private customers 700,000 if discounted those who can come off the bench, "the great unfinished business because until now had spoiled more to SMEs and retail client companies.
This year has attracted 250,000 customers and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while companies exceeds 10%.
Another pillar of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or whatever it is, of austerity, with cost reduction target and challenges which will expose the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks these days dare to set goals and make them public as the financial crisis has disrupted all plans for world banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its director Optima plan, set four years ago, though it was initially for three, but market conditions made it extended by one more year.
Customers who no longer escape the savings will be their main objective.
At a breakfast organized by FIPA, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a year of "difficult and momentous."
The executive, in fact, believes that ending the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
In addition, two or three years will be "very difficult to create jobs, which is essential for the survival of the banking business, he said.
And, although he believes that the war which criminalizes passive margins-is reducing the price of risk premiums being paid by banks and emissions for liquidity are moving and the price of credit to offset the decline margins.
"The issue of liquidity and funding is structural, and will be a factor of pressure on the credit."
"We have not closed the tap, but spreads are higher," admitted Guardiola.
Banesto and Thursday gave orders to his network to limit the long-term credit and the price rise in spreads, see CincoDías 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend of banks now is to raise fees, "but" there is a competitive framework. "
Sabadell The master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not surprisingly, says that in Spain "will require larger sizes."
"Next year is going to move everything," he said.
States that capital requirements are "risen a lot" and does not rule that any Spanish bank into the red.
And he notes that the market can supply FROB in raising funds to new capital injections.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets shrugged off what some bankers predict and as a new liquidity crisis.
States that can not be issued, but unlike what happened in June, you can get short term financing through repos, which dampens the crisis.
The ECSC rule out a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled yesterday that there will be a wave of mergers of savings and re-emphasized the speed with which it is running the restructuring of the sector.
When starting the process of concentration of Spanish savings banks were several institutions that ensured they would not participate in this first phase and will be reserved for the second round.
However, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I think the biggest part of the merger is done, the incorporation of Cajasol Civic Banking group can not be said to be a second round, there are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely done and might go instead of 17 to 13 or 14 but all the major processes have already been made and supervised by the Bank of Spain, which has worked so far well," said the manager.
Speaking at a breakfast meeting of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has submitted that the merger process is being pursued "as fast as possible, and we must be very pleased as was produced in the time that once, not now, were scored in the business plans with the Bank of Spain, "he said.
"Going from 45 boxes with an average volume of 28,500 million of assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to comply with Basel "he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are some unfortunate enough opinions about the slowness of the process" to demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense" because "what the Bank of Spain is to remember that we have to be within the period before end of year. "
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olave, said yesterday that Spain has more rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" the world, and blamed those who put into question a "lack of knowledge."
The manager said that within the current economic climate, "we can be very quiet" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undergone a process of concentration "important" and that "goes to as quickly as possible. "
He also recalled that the Spanish banks went very well stop the stress tests conducted by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has set conditions for the whole Union.
The tensions in the markets have caused a double reply.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has made new adjustment measures, from tax cuts to SMEs, regulation of private placement or removal of the 426 euros of aid to the unemployed without benefits, until the privatization of 49% of AENA, management of airport of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
Furthermore, the vice president Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for his role in the current crisis.
How should we interpret these moves?
Go ahead Merkel's position is not an error in its communication policy.
On the contrary, is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And that Germany has a radically new vision of what should be its future, which contrasts with that of maintaining the ancient traditions of many of its partners.
Against European resistance in Germany began to speculate on three possible solutions to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, composed herself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, while the south would abandon the currency area.
The second, the recovery of the frame, but now seem like science fiction, with a stream of extremely good, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the proposals Germanic greater macroeconomic control, budgetary discipline, fines offenders countries, potential defaults of any of them and private sector extension of the potential adjustment costs.
The German position is clear and has long been defined, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission encouraged the deficits, the German Government pulled off a constitutional amendment to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of conflict between what Germany thought should be done (plans for fiscal discipline and stability in public finances), and what they were practicing their European partners, including France.
The second in front of the Central European country gave when Merkel painfully reached the decision to rescue Greece.
And then came under fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and advertising was very much against the bailout of Greece.
Finally, in late October, again Merkel emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of EU treaties, to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time, forcing private lenders to bear of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European and has precipitated the crisis and everything Irish.
But his proposal, if somewhat watered down, it has been approved in the coming months, we should assist the reform process of the Union to enable those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to cross.
And we are telling everyone that, but now has to take measures that may not quite agree, as of that date the house of the euro, will be over.
The 2013 mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which offenders will be severely sanctioned countries may be forced to declare bankruptcy, and in this case, the private sector also bear part of the cost.
Germany is saying that we must follow a strict growth path with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness and external balances positive.
Alternatively, based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, as he has presided over the Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not tolerate.
The stake is clear.
And not understanding it would be wrong.
It is not just to refocus the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we require is a lot harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope the current turmoil give way to greater peace of mind.
And seize the window of opportunity they have given us until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also has understood this and its dual manifest (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with big business and today's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, has opened way the thesis that we must put house in order.
But the red line that Germany has drawn up there is, and does not appear to be moving.
And among the possibilities that are targeted, to abandon a currency area too crowded not very serious country can not be excluded.
Germany then you can always say he had warned us.
Sports and legal fraud
Tricks such as Alonso and Ramos at the Ajax show ingenuity but unwilling to escape a penalty.
The expulsion allegedly hatched by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match played on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about whether or not such conduct is unsportsmanlike and if, eventually, both players should be punished by UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (his team already had clearly cattle), the two players deliberately lost time when misconduct paths out to cause the referee showed a second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid and eventually as leader of his group, both players meet the statutory penalty next group game against Auxerre, and clean card can spend the next phase.
Finally, the disciplinary committee of UEFA has banned for two matches the team's coach, Jose Mourinho, and with different financial amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card or similar circumstances like this is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
Is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of the unwritten rules, but followed, in this sport.
Part of the debate emerged in the reported case is that has been played by a team of Real Madrid's institution (which in their anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and that in times past has fined his players for similar acts) and orchestrated the drama, apparently, by Mourinho, who added one more episode of his long history of dramatic and provocative technical.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether such behavior is not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, if these actions were committed fraud law, in effect, are friendly actions sporting regulations, but seem to escape its meaning.
The question goes to examine the type of damage they cause to sportsmanship.
One of the assets comprising the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opponents, something that these actions are not put at risk, ie there was no horseplay.
Another of these goods which are referred to fair play is to prevent offending team players unfairly take advantage of the opposing team, which did not happen.
However, the paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is not settled on what is normally characterize as cheating or fraud, for his violation of the rules was not secretly trying to avoid the penalty but precisely the action sought to be as clear in order to receive the punishment from the referee.
Expected and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage obtained offenders in intentional misconduct examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that not placed at a disadvantage to rival or benefit is in the same match, then obviously the result of the action is left to its own team with fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next match because the club will be without those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten his participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term benefit, with a degree of uncertainty, because the equipment can be removed at the first hurdle, and also, in this way the players play a match ban and pass into the second round of cards, that the suspension for card accumulation occurs with less than the first cycle.
So that, of passing rounds, is not so clear that it is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions do not go against the spirit of sport, which itself forms part of strategic decisions that support to make the most of what is permitted by the rules.
In the case before us, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this itself would be a clear case of fraud law), but rather chose when to have it.
Made a strategic decision not to escape punishment or circumvent it.
Although the border between genius and evasion of the law is vague on this occasion I think it was a clear case of genius.
The controversy, I think, arises from two factors: because they dealt with two autoexpulsiones and how they took out the transmission of the guideline to cause them.
The damage to the principles of sport for these actions is both ethical and aesthetic.
Offensive bid to capture the Christmas dinners at NCB Group
The dictatorship of the calendar focuses this year a flood of bookings for 16 and 17.
Autosufragadas proliferate celebrations for employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As nougat and the lottery, with the arrival of December also become the group dinner before Christmas, still acting as a boost for the restoration and recreation of Barcelona, ​​but because of the crisis have resulted in an offensive adjusted prices to capture the customer majority: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for dinner or lunch, match employers and industry associations interviewed.
To complicate the accounting end of the calendar this year (New Year's Eve falling on a Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of Dec. 13, with the result so far of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 16 and 17) and just move to the previous week.
As has been happening since 2008, when he began the lean period, many companies have been eliminated for budgetary issue collective dinner.
To not do without the tradition, many workers keep paying out of pocket.
Whatever the situation, and others require a price battle, confirmed the president of the Guild of Restauració of Barcelona, ​​Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of employers, to this day, no one dares to predict how they will be the celebration of this month.
"People think about it much before booking."
"He wants out but has lit alerts on the issue of prices," he says.
The business will be fine "to which they give value for money and great service," he says, and points out that customers tend to lose a step with the crisis, so the band at around 25 euros has become majority demand.
In a survey of several downtown establishments verified the collapse of requests for the night of 17.
In group Soteras indicate a real boom of requests for this Friday, with the aim to spend less than 30 euros, which have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, complete with formulas 25 to 35 euros.
In one of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 stores in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has brought more advance booking, even from early November.
"We have done everything possible to keep the same price last year, with menus for all tastes, from 19.95 to 30 euros," detail.
In AN group, which championed the Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and a total of 23 stores, remain optimistic after noticing a surge in sales since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources emphasize that the group will be a day 18 also hyperactive group level precelebran friends parties.
In its six menus have added a holiday group, with 30 euros or more as star and budget perception that there is willingness to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for requiring more details such as cava.
They also see green shoots in some firms returning to invite their employees and feel that the volume is somewhat larger groups.
By the employer Fecasarm (including organizations like the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Barcelona), his vice president, Enric Gomà, hopes to start seeing the end of the tunnel, and states that all bookings are "animated" although clients "negotiate the fullest."
Of course, the enthusiasm for the festivities has not declined, pay pays, says.
Pakistan's nuclear program generated great concern in the U.S.
Islamabad produce atomic weapons "a faster rate than any other country."
Wikileaks leaks confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department leaked by Wikileaks website confirms the huge questions that arise in Washington Pakistan's nuclear program.
Apart from the illuminating and provide juicy details about the content of the conversations and thoughts of the American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear safety, rather than to be increasing, "decrease" and that China produces unstable nuclear weapons "at a pace faster than any other country in the world."
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that weapons are not assembled but remain difficult components stored for destruction in case of attack - is one of the main reasons for vigilance in Washington.
It lists the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of then national security adviser, James Jones, "The proximity of some nuclear facilities territory under Taliban attack, the rumored nuclear material dispersion and vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is provided, not only by the U.S., but also for Russia as a reason to keep proliferating and guard.
"Pakistan has had to recruit staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities, given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev, the Russian Foreign Ministry, in a meeting with their U.S. counterparts.
The newest of the documents leaked by Julian Assange portal is the dwindling US-Pakistan cooperation on nuclear proliferation issues and the high rate Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
An embassy office in May, calling them "frustrating" to communicate with Pakistan, says: "Transparency is often nonexistent, the offers of assistance go unanswered or are discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic meltdown, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a rate faster than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also calls on Washington, during a visit by Army chief Gen. Ashfaq Kayani, to leave "very clear" to the charge that "the army of Pakistan must end with the tacit support for terrorist groups."
A head-hunting Wikileaks
Obama appoints a senior counter-terrorism to prevent further leaks.
Interpol issued a red alert to monitor the movements and Assange locate where you are.
Everything about Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complex maze where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Interpol yesterday issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.
However, there is a traditional warrant.
Besides, is not new, but dates from 20 November.
And it has to do with the leak last more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the sexual abuse allegations that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, counsel for the operator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, said "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
It was the day 20 when the international police body based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but not revealed until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities of that country.
So, the 188 Interpol countries have shown to identify or locate Assange "in view of its provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol can not order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as explained by the organization, do consider the network call-ahead notice to proceed to an arrest - to be undertaken by the national body of police, especially if they have a bilateral extradition treaty, such as Sweden and England, where he is believed to Assange.
The move has outraged lawyers Assange, which yesterday published a letter denouncing the founder of Wikileaks, 39, has been willing to answer questions by video to the Swedish authorities.
Remember also that Assange requested and received permission to leave Sweden in the appropriate tax, which compares with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's security chief.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal prosecution, denounced the letter.
As the world looks for, and from Australia for his mother defends her son's innocence - Assange still missing, but not silent.
On Monday granted from an unspecified location an interview with the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which it requested the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If you can show that it was responsible for ordering American diplomats at the UN to spy in violation of international treaties the U.S. has signed, should resign," he said.
His view was maligned last press secretary at the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called it "ridiculous and absurd" the request for resignation.
"I'm not entirely sure why we should import the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has appointed a senior counter-terrorism, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The intent of the spokesman for President Barack Obama to downplay Assange contrasts with views that these days, conservative politicians and pundits proclaim.
Peter King, Congressman from January to chair the National Security Committee in the House, has asked the State Department consider Wikileaks include in the list of terrorist organizations to intervene and pursue funding and any of them any contribution or assistance. "
Has gone even further, Tom Flanagan, an advisor to the Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to backtrack after saying that Assange should "be killed."
"Obama should make it a target and use a drone or something."
Who made no apology was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than the execution would be too kind a punishment," he said on Fox News
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with hints related to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuation.
Huguet executive proposes a more plural and the end of the assembly system.
Puigcercós Joan seems to have found the recipe to overcome yet another internal revolt in the ranks of CKD, not north by the loss of 11 members and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is insufficient to those like the former leader Josep Lluis Carod-Rovira, but also knows that the influence of this sector is now so diluted as its mentor and that absolutely can cause headaches I had with other schools extinct.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra try to win over the New Critics with hints that allow shield to municipal elections.
For starters, Puigcercós said yesterday that more than 200 national ERC directors may decide on its continuation in secret.
By ballot, not freehand.
If a vehicle Carod want President protest vote may do so without fear of reprisal.
In fact, the team leader wants to avoid the image as much as the division of subjection to him.
In several interviews, said he would not be considered ratified with half plus one vote, but added, without specifying percentages, which would not be good a result "the Bulgarian."
Carod require the next president to more than just putting in his resignation to the militants, a gesture that counts when Puigcercós controls the maximum body between congresses.
But in the absence of a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap by May.
To do this, expect to participate in the elaboration of the strategic reorientation that the address be voted the national council on 18.
His intention is to Puigcercós endorse in return for this promise to Congress to advance the fall of 2011, which the dome as a given.
ERC leader acknowledged that "polyphony" undermines the stability and that its aim is to have, once and for all, the organization is able to wash the dirty laundry of closed doors.
In this line, it is significant that the Minister article Josep Huguet signed acting on his blog.
Puigcercós considered the ideologue of the holder of Innovation was assumed that the leader should be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives."
And listed five, of which two stand out.
The first, "reset" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, ie, to include new faces coming to Carod related sector.
The second may be the big news.
Huguet ERC proposed that settled once and gathering together as the operating mechanism.
Thus, calls for a reform of the statutes to conclude the conference by delegates elected.
Assembly-end model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession Puigcercós team, which struggled in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the turbulent conclave of 2008 left the task to review the direction of gathering together in a specific congressional reform statutes.
This appointment is still pending, because the internal tide discouraged in recent years addressing the issue.
Now, critical areas to watch, can be a good time to retake it and try to close it forever.

Obama on Twitter promotes law for undocumented students
"If they agree to pass the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation," tweeted the U.S. president on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined a national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If they agree to pass the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation," tweeted Obama.
His brief message holding open a cyber link to a larger document that asks the public to communicate immediately with the Senators, given that the vote of the legislation is imminent.
"With one vote which is expected soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block a vote on any legislation, unless an extension is approved the tax cuts the Bush years, government funding.
This blockage, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked by blocking Republican Dream Act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs hoped that once the tax issue resolved, you can set a schedule for the rest of the projects.
"I think there is a long time ..."
"We all agree that we need to resolve the matter before the end of fiscal year ..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of rest," he said.
The Democratic majority leader of the Senate, Harry Reid said Tuesday he would ask for a "vote to close debate" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted from next Thursday the Senate, but more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or law to legalize the American dream about 800 thousand young people who entered the U.S. before age 16, have remained in the country for the past five years and admitted to a college or the military.
But backers need 60 votes to pass the initiative, which require the assistance of a handful of Republicans, with the current star party organizations project an intense lobbying to ensure the passage of the law.
Democrats, most of whom supported the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican has expressed support for the bill, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
Thus, supporters of the Dream Act require adding a number of Republicans in the event that other Democrats decide to back the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Senators from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins and outgoing Senator George Lemieux, Florida, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act passed are Orrin Hatch of Utah, Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have stated that they supported it at another time.
Another Republican who supported John McCain, has not defined its position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faced major obstacles in the Senate.

The protagonist sighed with relief and concluded "the sore I could only know what is real open and that does not exist," but convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls of language must be interlocked.
Valenzuela, writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramirez also presented a delightful narrative titled In Praise of the invention, where the nail on the head but does not name at a time when it is discovered.
With touches of magic realism, tells of a famous witch, who himself played clouds, bringing back men who had gone away or repaired the virtues that had lost a maiden narrative then turned to speak Latin, great novel which did not lack from the outset its own reporters that quoted count and Bernal Diaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of the captains told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes invented us all (the writers) made a mockery of mock witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise never have come to tell the story of America's imagination that he needed to modesty ."

The night ended the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that nail on the head of the committed writer's writer."
Considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, even in the intellectual habits and control of conscience which leads to dogmatism, forgetting "that behind every statement there is a small and not behind every denial there is a small yes."
"To be masters of our own thinking and own reality we have to nuance, and nuance often means putting the nail on the head and annoy people who are much more comfortable thinking of caricature in black and white, set of ideas and without nuance and also upset the powers that prefer a black and white world, "he said, inviting regain the sense of writing.

NASA announces discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency quoted the press tomorrow morning to a finding that cause impact on the pursuit of living in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of America will be announced tomorrow, Thursday, astrobiology discovery that could prove the theory that there is extraterrestrial life.
The findings will be presented at a press conference Thursday at 13:00 in NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, described as the science which studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in universe.
Quoting the press, said NASA will present "a finding that cause impact in the search for extraterrestrial life," raising speculation of experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there are few creatures to us and in hostile environments thought to be uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if they improve the living conditions.
Apparently this is a bug that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake Yosemite National Park, California, where he lives in an environment that is thought too toxic to any life form, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature used arsenic as a way to survive and this capability increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which are not our benevolent atmosphere.
According astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will demonstrate that "there are other life form, a second form of life different from what we know."
The space agency will know the true extent of the findings at the press conference on Thursday.
The conference will involve the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (Saturn's largest moon), from the perspective of its chemistry is similar to of the Earth.

Since yesterday was installed the 60 legislature, composed of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, PAN 13, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one of the PVEM, for a total of 40 elected representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is coming to make a clean management and commitment to society and different sectors that require legislative work responsibly and not to repeat the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism.
Eduardo Davalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly released 40 Members of Congress of State assume the great responsibility of being an example of looking for a better Sinaloa by the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that the deputies actually exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary to make arrangements to ensure their own interests and carnival parades become the rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
Thus spoke certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges pushing forward the Ruler of the day.
"We are definitely coming to do a decent job and above all committed to society and the sectors they were the Sinaloa who gave them the confidence vote in past elections."
Manguart José Ramón Sánchez, president of the Three Islands Hotel Association, considered one of the great challenges of the 40 representatives of the people is to push and join forces in search of the state's economic growth because today's economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that push economic growth to create incentives for investment and infrastructure and that somehow promote job creation."
Regarding tourism, the new legislators demanded that give weight lining in the state budget to strengthen the state Tourism Department.
"I have understood that the second secretary in the state with a lower budget and is inconsistent as a major economic activity and generating foreign exchange and investment that directly competes with the agricultural industry."
In addition to resources required to tag triggers and tourism projects which contribute to give security to the state and the update to the Alcohol Law have not been resolved in previous legislatures.

Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in the Eastern Townships, has made a dozen prosecutions in the dismantling of a network of production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested to face various charges.
The persecutions have taken place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places where they carried out drug production.
"They have seized about 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for production," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Safety of Quebec.
In total, have been arrested eleven men and three women, including two alleged leaders of the network, two men of Sherbrooke.
The detainees were to appear in the Sherbrooke courthouse in the hours following his arrest.
Could face charges of producing cannabis, possession with the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have been produced after a long investigation that has lasted nearly a year.
"It was the information provided by the public which allowed us to make arrests," says Mr. Ruel.
In this police operation involving about seventy agents research module of the Security Estrie Quebec, Sherbrooke Police Service and the Police Department Memphremagog.
Able to fight against illegal migration without problems
The bill of conservatives who, according to the Government, should solve the problem of illegal migrant-laden boats, surely face strong opposition, since all three opposition parties announced on Wednesday they could not support it.
"I rely primarily on the Charter."
"I am here with a party that has created the granite that you step," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after holding weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would stop up to one year to anyone who comes from a transport vessel identified as illegal immigrants violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc in Quebec, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it targets the wrong target.
"We are against and, apparently, all opposition parties are against the project, so we'll see what the government," Mr. Duceppe said.
Criticism of immigration NPD, Olivia Chow, has rejected a stroke the criticism that his party is not firm enough with illegal immigrants.
"The neodemócratas agree that action be taken against those responsible for the boats of illegal immigrants and that's what we want with another bill, C-35," says Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the bill because it attacks the Conservatives for refugees and children imprisoned for at least a year," says Ms. Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of the position of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians said the deputies who do not tolerate this type of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada and who treat the country like a doormat."
"They hope that Canada adopt strong measures," says the Minister Kenney.
The Government has announced a confidence vote on his bill, which could lead the country to elections due to its rejection.
However, a conservative has informed the Agency QMI that the government would request the holding of a vote for each member that will be explained later object to their constituents.
The new unit can not unanimity
Although it had announced the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers are calling for the establishment of a commission of public consultation on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation in New York is concerned since January last year.
The metropolis has an ongoing drive against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, Tuesday's announcement has caught by surprise more than one.
It said that during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Law Enforcement in Quebec on Oct. 29, never discussed this action despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the critic of Quebec party dealing with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, categorizing this announcement as "a rabbit out of the hat" and "a sloppy last minute solution."
The Minister Dutil, meanwhile, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You will see the results when we announce it," he says simply.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the release of a public inquiry.
"The more obstinate Mr. Charest to avoid the creation of this commission of inquiry, most people share our view, that is, it has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is in the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance of the national school of public administration.
To get out of this impasse, Quebec suggests that a special mandate granted to the comptroller general to conduct an inquiry into collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the auditor general," he concludes.
It also believes that Quebec could provide the controller with the same powers as a commissioner, allowing you to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent crew is not the only project looming in the Charest government.
Quebec also calls on Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better suit this type of crime.
This request seems to come from fiscal Marteau operation, which has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier of the law is not explicit in this type of research.
The federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed its its counterpart of Justice, Rob Nicholson, currently leans make some amendments on this subject.
During Operation Spring 2001 related to biker groups, but had not adapted the Criminal Code, 131 people were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa encouraged the adoption of the Law on gangsterism.
Rivers under extreme vigilance
Several rivers are being closely watched due to heavy rains that have occurred in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
As a precaution, two homes have been evacuated.
At night, there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
He sank a road.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions reported heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 mm of rain.
Also expected between 20 and 40 mm further from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The areas north of the river and in the Ottawa Valley were worst affected.
Could receive up to a total of 100 mm of rain.
Since this precipitation are added to the melting of the snow had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several rivers to overflow.
On Wednesday night, the unit of the Quebec Civil Security alert issued for rivers and Achigan Ouareau in Lanaudière.
The rivers in the north, Saint-Jérôme in the Laurentians, and Chen, in Lotbinière, have already caused flooding in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rains have caused overflowing some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have washed a temporary bridge.
As a precautionary measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Ottawa, the overflow of some lakes has led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the town of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security Unit is on alert and monitor the situation closely, as indicated by Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Centre for forecasting floods Quebec, meanwhile, on Wednesday issued notices informing the heavy flooding of several rivers, including the Maskinongé, the Assumption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and Loup.
Partially blame Dupont
The Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered some loss to the Canadian Council of broadcasting standards (CCNR) for a few controversial statements on social assistance and Haitians, and for his foul language on the radio .
The CCNR believes that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI FM 98.1 had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance, an unduly negative representation of Haitians and foul language should not be used in the programs broadcast during the day. "
The Council also indicated that discussions on suicide, including disclosure of the names of two people who had committed suicide, do not violate the codes of broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made in programs broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued after a complaint from the common front of people receiving social assistance in Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters must communicate reliable and not conducive to cheating.
Regarding suicide, presented Stéphane Dupont had said that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most Committee members have concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be considered as a solution to the problems of life.
"Most of the Committee believes that jeopardized episodes of" Dupont midi you "have tried a sensitive issue in a fair and appropriate."
Therefore, in this respect has rejected any blame.
The last issue dealt with the statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At the time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had staged a confrontation that had attracted media reactions.
CHOI presenter said he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure if the need were to actually receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments are not abusive, but their cumulative effect is an unduly negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've done my suspension of three days up there."
"My record is clean for a year and a half," said the presenter.
In all decisions, the Committee report the emission of foul language.
In any case, the radio station CHOI-FM has worked "even more than required."
The consequences will be minimal for the station, which should, among other things, announce decisions once in prime time within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Algerian-born Montrealer Nacereddine Zemmal has had a very peculiar route.
The athlete, who excels in "Sand" (kung-fu "full contact"), and and Thai kickboxing box, goes to the mat and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," said Zemmal, who lives in the metropolis since 2008 to advance the professional level.
"For me, looking fighting everywhere because, for those who do not enjoy the game on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in America."
The athlete, who works as a security officer and as employee of UPS, has recently given bad news to their rivals, winning two gold medals in the amateur championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he said.
"Now I prepare to participate in the World Cup in China san shou."
"They will invite athletes who have finished in the top four in the last world championship in each category."
"In 2009, won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, finished in eighth place."
"In 2007 in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but reached the third place in Toronto in 2009," he said.
"The interesting thing is that I have made progress in every competition."
"At this rate, will be the first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "watermelon" is a discipline originating in China that are allowed to hit with fists and feet and throw opponents to the ground.
The fighting was originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the martial arts world.
Although born just Zemmal must maintain a competition in his career, no doubt will go to great tournament, "King of Sanda," the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most renowned and prestigious in China," explains the likeable boy.
"It's like the equivalent of Lumpinee stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was an incredible experience."
Zemmal has won his first match in the semifinals in its class (80 kg), but lost in the final.
"To have won is a true professional," he says.
"There are four competitors in each category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The semifinal winners face off in the end of class."
"Then the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million no-bid contracts
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $ 450 million to engineering firms for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the center of this avalanche of over a hundred contracts are a consortium of companies BPR, Dessau, SM Groupe Axor, which has been obtained without a competitive tender the largest contract, the management of the project, a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Energie gérance, was created in 2004 following the decision by Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector the responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of 5,000 million dollars.
In early 2005, the consortium won the lucrative Énergie gérance contract without previously made a public bidding.
For the Québec Party, the use of consortia of companies poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and lead to higher prices.
"This is a new method of collusion and of eliminating competition."
"In other words, the people, rather than in secret, now do it openly," he said yesterday the Quebec Party deputy Sylvain Simard in a news conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard posed the question in the National Assembly because, he says, does not understand how it can benefit the public interest in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, said in the afternoon, strongly denying that there has been collusion with this contract.
"I start to get tired," he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted "dishonest" and "lack of rigor."
He noted that "the minimum" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The formula of the consortium is a common practice in the world.
Typically, this is a partnership with a time limit that allows two or more companies combine their knowledge to respond to a call for a complex project.
Eastmain project has a high level of complexity, given the scale of the work.
Work has already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract was awarded without competition come into play, we have tried to negotiate.
In addition, the formula of the consortium is no longer the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As published last week Le Devoir, the formula of the pools in the area of ​​expertise is undergoing an investigation into the government.
A quick look at the commercial register of Quebec to identify more than 200 partnerships, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, the firm Dessau works in partnership with most of its major competitors, such as CIMA +, GENIVAR, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, et al.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leading to a single legal entity, ie, Dessau.
Regarding the consortium Énergie gérance, Minister Normandeau stated that "the territory of James Bay responds to a dynamic workforce and Hydro-Québec particular responds specifically to it since the 1970's."
The great Eastmain project manager, Réal Laporte, the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ) has given an explanation which has highlighted the fact that the project management contract was awarded directly.
"If you respond to a tender and there are few players, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in touch with industry players and say, we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but competition from people," said Mr. Laporte.
The contract awarded to the consortium Énergie gérance part of a long list of contracts over $ 50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or for the project SEBJ Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 companies or their subsidiaries, including geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, GENIVAR scored 16, 14 and Dessau Tecsult 10, regardless of their participation in gérance Énergie.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, amounted to $ 449,783,344, including energy contracts gérance of $ 295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has been suggested that the four companies of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe Axor SM) are "well known Quebec Liberal Party."
Minister Normandeau has hinted that the PQ is also linked to these companies that "fund" before describing it instead of their leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption. The label "green" does not inspire confidence
Greener, but deeply skeptical.
Quebec consumers just trust the actors of sustainable development, as well as fair trade marks or green certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first results were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a world where media messages abound, advocating a more responsible, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers it even slows down its commitment.
Even if increased consumption of products called "socially responsible" in 2010, Quebecers seem to give little credit to those who try to sell.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, they do not trust the environmental commitment of businesses and environmentalists in advertising them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the responsible consumption Observatory of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers questioned the reliability of official certificates that carry the products known as fair, and the credibility of the products and brands that have labels indicating that they are "eco responsible," the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers are taken seriously by politicians' speeches on this issue.
In any case, the information on responsible drinking seems essential to stimulate the consumption sector, currently supported by nearly a third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the gaps and the uncertainty of information are that 46% of consumers discard this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
Moreover, a third of Quebecers say they also wary of assumptions yields ecological goods and services they are trying to sell.
Moreover, nearly half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to meet their convictions.
61% has given priority to purchases in the stores in his neighborhood, preferring to buy food grown in their region, according to the Barometer.
Greener and responsible (the responsible consumption rate has reached 64 points on a maximum of one hundred this year), Homo Quebec consumus loves the position of the king of recycling that aims to reduce its impact on the environment worrying about protecting fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, the social consciousness of doors seems to be (your car) out: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers said they have used public transport or shared drive to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this extensive survey of behavior, which just completed its first edition, supports cycling and walking.
A loan for the state to recover Excentris
The Government of Quebec, who have asked to commit financially to the recovery of post-cinema complex Société Excentris Angus and Parallel, you agree to cooperate, but only by a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and Parallèle, who hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy back Daniel Langlois Excentris cinema complex on the boulevard Saint-Laurent and restore its true vocation movie fan, have not got what they asked.
The Government has agreed to become involved in the matter, but on their own terms.
Instead of the expected grant, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan amount of which would, in fact, lower than initial expectations, it could be a viable solution on favorable terms, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec has already rejected last spring, a first action plan and a request for 12.8 million, but since then applications have been revised downward.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the record Excentris, submitted a proposal and a plan of action to the Minister St-Pierre.
He has submitted a final report about ten days ago.
However, SODEC Cabinet received a counterproposal on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have until 31 December to respond to it.
In any case, it seems to be completely discarded the hypothesis of a grant from the State.
Recall that the Homeowners Association of cinemas and cinema complexes in Quebec was opposed to a direct government investment to support the recovery of Excentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has no other cinemas.
On the other hand, several other industry representatives call for considerable financial aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of it has been for ten years the burden of the auteur cinema at its premises in the complex, after finance their own construction, which could justify a waiver by Treasury Board.
The lack of room for independent films is evident in Montreal and Excentris had known loyalty to his clientele.
The company Parallèle Angus and led by Christian Yaccarini, in turn driving a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $ 700,000 to make its way to the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, Parallel, still showing films in Excentris.
The aim of the prospective buyers is to reopen the three theaters on February 27, projecting the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois' Des hommes et des Dieux. "
However, Christian Yaccarini has not returned to contact Le Devoir and do not know what he and his group say the low proposals they have received.
It lifts the veil of Canada complexed ...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. considers as the complex of Canadians with respect to the Americans, but reflect both a sense of superiority of the latter to Canada.
American diplomats were surprised that Canadian voters do not think the Canada-US relations when they go to vote and believe that Obama's visit has helped the Conservative government to get approval of its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington have made public yesterday, offered more juicy details that really substantial content.
A cable of 22 September 2008, ie during federal election campaign, tells how the U.S. did not enter into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This caused great surprise sent the U.S. ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
"Perhaps the political leaders are constrained by an inferiority complex almost inherent to Canadians in dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving that choice to the United States (and during the campaign for free trade in 1988) "he writes.
Consequently, he concludes, the United States are "the proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it."
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding the "deafening silence" because the two countries maintain a strong political and economic relations.
"Obviously, the view, the ability of a candidate, party and, further, the leader of a party to manage these key relationships should be a key factor that voters should consider when voting."
You can see this feeling of importance is also the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, charge d'affaires in Ottawa to prepare for President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Her trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, through which Canada deficit recorded for the first time in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between 30,000 and 40,000 million dollars, "writes Mr. Breese.
Nowhere is mentioned that the government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid took it over the coalition nor the opposition parties to influence survival quality recovery plan.
Other communication January 2008 signed by Ambassador Wilkins warning Washington about the increasingly negative image conveyed by the dramatic series broadcast on CBC U.S..
Ambassador is concerned about the issue of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which are made unsubtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly" List "or even to kidnapping to make the CIA vigorous interrogation.
Another cable that during his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to accept some prisoners at Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner said yes, but that depended "of each case."
At the end of the meeting, wrote, "has delivered a document to the Secretary of State in respect of Omar Khadr, a Muslim 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The Secretariat agreed to review the record."
Finally, we mention that have warmed the mood in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former close advisor to Stephen Harper, told CBC radio that the head of this massive outflow should be "killed."
In the United States echoed Mike Huckabee.
A global plan to renovate the lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed a renovation plan Cancun domestic lighting, commercial and industrial in a hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) in an amount corresponding to almost a third of the additional reduction to be carried out to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the larger set of specific projects that the UN expected to adopt in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding commitments for reducing emissions in industrialized countries.
Under the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, they still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, to be replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, better yet, by lamps emitting diodes (LED or "LED" in English), avoid much of the 1,800 million tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted in the world to enlighten humans.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
Is equivalent to 70% of the global car fleet emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, the major emitting countries, including the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to a voluntary reduction plans should reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, should even 5 Gt reduced that amount to stabilize by 2020, increasing the temperature by two degrees centigrade to prevent it from getting out.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated as heat and the rest, ie 5%, producing light.
For fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and the new LED bulbs are still twice as reduce energy consumption.
Fluocompact bulbs last on average between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those the manufacturer Philips has launched this week (a company that has also participated in the study of the UN) have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and use 80% less energy than a incandescent bulb, which gives us an idea of ​​the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would apply in a hundred countries.
These new lamps can also work with resistors and emit very little heat.
Above, contain no mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluocompact bulbs because they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturers put instructions.
However, the report indicates, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet are not fluocompact bulbs, but coal-fired power plants that emit large amounts of mercury to produce electricity that is wasted with incandescent bulbs.
In the U.S. alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that offer this international program for each country.
For example, Indonesia would be saved in this way one billion dollars a year on electricity to eight million tonnes of CO2, ie, equivalent to 3.5 power plants whose construction would cost 2,500 million.
Ivory Coast Anxiously awaiting the announcement of election results
The UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, has requested the "immediate" publication of the results of presidential elections in Ivory Coast since the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary General stressed the need for the independent electoral commission complete its work and to announce provisional results immediately," notes a spokesman for the UN chief.
"Calls upon all Ivorian parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any action until the announcement of interim results."
Despite pressure from foreign governments, the electoral commission has let the deadline pass Wednesday at midnight but the results were published three days after the election on Sunday.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI had said on television that the commission was "still working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, have multiplied in the world demands that the CIS finally proclaim the name of the winner of the runoff between the outgoing opponent Laurent Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara.
However, Gbagbo's side has the annulment by the Constitutional Council of the vote "fraud" in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) from the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of President of the Ivory Coast, said that the maneuvers of intimidation of voters by the FN in the north of the country had deterred the outgoing president's supporters to vote.
The whole election could be nullified if the Constitutional Council accepts complaints by Gbagbo.
But Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral since it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has been deemed "unacceptable" the delay in publishing the results and called on Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory .
His allies say that Gbagbo blocked publication of the results because he knows he has lost, and lodge a complaint with the Constitutional Council after the election commission prevented the dissemination of results, would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections on Sunday, should have put the icing on the process of reunification and reconciliation of a divided country in two years.
The United Nations warned on Wednesday of the political class of the Ivory Coast that could be held liable for potential violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished the first round, Oct. 31, with 38% of the vote compared to 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who was publicly supported by former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the French unemployment rate has remained stable at 9.3% on the mainland (9.7% taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected seasonal variations (CVE) interim released Thursday by the INSEE.
The number of unemployed is at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
Data for the second quarter were confirmed by 9.3% of the workforce on the mainland and 9.7% with the DOM.
In one year, the unemployment rate has been an increase of 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but want to work, whether or not available within two weeks to work and seek employment or not.
The situation of the youth labor market has continued to deteriorate, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including the DOM.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between 15 and 24 were unemployed in the sense of the ILO.
For its part, has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points both in three months in a year), ie 482,000 people more than 50 years, rising to 6.6% with the DOM.
Only there has been stability in unemployment among people aged between 25 and 49, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in France.
The Insee has since 2006 without publishing the monthly unemployment rate, after a controversy over its methods of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre investigated and arrested Guérini
Guérini Alexandre, 53, director of waste management companies and brother of President PS General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been jailed in the prison of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social goods, embezzlement of public funds and assets, concealment, bribery, influence peddling and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and respond to all questions referred to it by the judge, not ghosts."
"It's easy to chase by a host of reprehensible acts, another thing is to show them," the AFP had told her lawyer, Florence Rault, before the appearance of his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the leader of PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, wanted to convey through his lawyers the court before his hearing, a document to explain.
On Wednesday night began to investigate and also jailed one of his close people Rapezzi Philippe.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, all he has done his client had been dealing with the landfill to be handled.
Regarding the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to its implementation, does not know anything about it, the lawyer says Simon.
In the context of this case, is also being investigated on Wednesday Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, embezzlement and complicity, but has been released on bail and is prohibited from meeting with protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts which had criticized."
"The magistrate took into account the explanations and left him free," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday night to Wednesday questioned four people and left them the freedom, under court supervision for two of them, as indicated by the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Karabadjakian Michel, director general of the Marseille Provence Métropole property (MPM), has been accused of "influence peddling and passive corruption."
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned by "kidnapping and embezzlement of public property by a person dedicated to public service" and "complicity in the embezzlement of public funds, respectively.
Finally, the companion of Alexander Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for "covering up the abuse of social goods."
Among those who have met Mr. Guérini figure Brunengo-Stéphane Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case involving fraudulent contracts to Corsica.
Researchers suspect that their societies have service to launder capital of the great banditry.
The research is being done in connection with various legal proceedings brought against X instructions in April 2009 after receiving some anonymous communications, for alleged fraud in the allocation of public contracts, particularly in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation said that the research focuses especially on the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Reiss Clotilde Subject: Elisha has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For over ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for spying, has been in suspense to the public in France, has warned the diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eyes of U.S. diplomats.
U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveals unknown aspects of this crisis.
Describes how Elisha has explained his strategy to the Americans to the point of giving advice on managing their own crises of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
Show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the French girl was not in exchange for the release of Kakavand Majid, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by U.S. courts for trafficking of materials for Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, revealing the stark reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the impression that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, had played a key role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, did nothing.
A diplomatic telegram drafted August 12, 2009 in Paris titled "Iran: French comments on how to manage cases of hostage taking."
Elisha's adviser for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay to North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talking with the U.S. diplomatic Allegrone Kathleen.
They explain the French method.
Advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens detained by force in Iran.
"Make noise," saying, "release all the time" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "Innocence," "immediate release."
Everything to embarrass the Iranian regime, careful of his image.
"When I ask you to stop Iran, do it more often yet."
Because, after exhausting attempts to negotiate for discrete channels, "silence does not solve anything," the Iranians are "experts in delaying tactics."
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of aliens is "a common Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail."
Announced that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will occur on August 16, the day that took refuge in the embassy of France) "will require the payment to the Iranians a lot of money (230,000 euro reward.)
It also notes that the anticipated Eliseo other hostage crisis, a phenomenon that "will increase."
The Iranians could "in the near future another stop about 1,800 French citizens live in Iran," he says.
August 28, 2009.
Reiss Clotilde released from prison after twelve days, but is blocked in Iran.
Disseminates the following information: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the U.S. request for smuggling of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, has been released in Paris by order of a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, ​​as many observers doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, that about Iran's clandestine network of procurement for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France agreed to an exchange?
"Liberating the Iranian exchange for the French?
During a further conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4, François Richier ensures that did not happen.
The Elysée Palace, he says, not only "greatly surprised by the judge's decision, but tried to oppose it.
"There have been intensive negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government can not override the decision" judicial says.
Mr. Richie also wants to show that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of the French information services.
The director of Elisha dialing a phone, hang up and then informed the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in buildings in Paris run by the Iranian embassy."
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Eliseo spares no efforts, using press releases and "leaks" organized in the media to believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "overshadowing" "mediator."
Americans observed this activity with some irony and the manipulation check comes off, as several newspaper articles convey the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentioned "the 'blitz' media of the French officials."
What is the reason that "gratitude" to Mr. Assad, asked the embassy in Paris.
"Despite his statements full of praise, French officials privately acknowledge that only have a vague idea of ​​what the Syrians have done really."
Then the paper discusses the reasons that led to Elisha to give rise to this fiction.
The great effort of communication "is to validate the policy of opening Sarkozy to Syria," he says.
A policy begun in 2008, that "in the opinion of many critics in France and abroad, had just been accused of being premature and undeserved."
To "exaggerate the Syrian role," Paris tries to "show Syria that it can reap the praise if it plays a constructive role in the region."
The goal also is to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The U.S. Embassy knows a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier confides: "Of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done something or not."
"But anyway, we are grateful."
"At least, this should cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives at the Elysee.
In a statement, thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria have played an "active role for the release of our compatriot."
After midnight, the young Koreans can not play online
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Cinderella" that prevent teens play games online after midnight blocking your access as government officials have indicated.
In December, a bill submitted to Parliament to ask the online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight to people under 16, as indicated representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family .
"Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study in school and lead a normal life during the day."
"We think this law is necessary to protect their health and their right to dream," said Jo AFP Rhine ministry official in charge of the bill.
Online games are again available at six in the morning.
The companies have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law accurately.
The government also proposes to ask companies to limit the time of daily access to these games when young parents so request, the official said.
In addition, it will make available on request free software that let you limit the time Internet connection.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" with news and newspapers regularly on various events related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global competition online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber ​​Games, where she faced 58 other countries.
2018-2022 World: FIFA designates the host countries
In the midst of the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, the FIFA executive committee appointed on Thursday to host countries for the World Cups of 2018 and 2022, a clear political choice where struggles for influence and lobbying can reach prevail over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA tournament will be held in Europe, the traditional stronghold of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or proceed with its implementation in the United States or the Far East (Japan , South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the heads of Belgian and Dutch Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies economic and political interests at play in the World Cup.
Transactions between racks, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the evaluation report the FIFA nominations English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and U.S. (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations do not have too much weight to the 22 executive committee members at the time of voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension by corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), may have ruined the opportunities for his country, the birthplace of football, which hosted the World Cup only once in 1966.
The BBC added fuel to the fire on Monday broadcast a documentary that has exposed three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to upset the FIFA and shame those responsible for English, who have launched an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the helm.
The Head of Government hopes to reissue the successful blow by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had managed in 2005 to London Olympics organizing 2012.
This intense activity, will be sufficient to restore the gloss from England to the EC?
It is unclear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has many strong points through its stages, ready, your experience (82 in Spain World, Olympic Games in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could bring down his ambitions.
The reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only succeed is to give points to Russia, which has become an outsider in weight despite the gaps in your application (stadiums, hotels, transportation).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to go to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," a direct allusion to the English press charges against members of the EC.
"They are bringing out their dirty laundry, trying to engage them," said Putin.
For 2022, the United States, who have the experience of 1994, seem more logical favorites.
First global economic powerhouse and home to the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to take advantage of Japan and South Korea, have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new candidates seem premature for two countries that have organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the World Award 2026 to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia ran out of possibilities for 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has submitted the project based on future stages, and Australia, FIFA would continue with its expansion into new horizons, but both countries have higher risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of the TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) for European countries, the backbone of the war for the Cup.
Second term: the test
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had suggested that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had not the slightest doubt.
Nicolas Sarkozy And even less.
A term in the Elysee leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
However, this evidence does not blend well with the mystery often associated with the role of president.
Therefore, always appearing to doubt.
To one side to the other.
In 2006, they believed it or not, friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that did not rule out a third term.
On 15 November, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated he would take his decision "sometime in autumn 2011."
Therefore, the fact that dealing with UMP deputies on Tuesday evening at the Elysee, the possibility of "two terms" has caused a stir.
Is this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Hardly.
The president only indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 limiting to two the number of five-year terms.
Simply transmitting facts, not an ad.
Is not the first time he talks about the presidential election, with a humorous tone in such meetings.
"At worst, or best of cases, still will spend seven and a half with me," was released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Think not that I do not plan what comes next."
His statements yesterday not closer to the nomination, nor less.
Give rise to comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the nomination in the PS, on one side.
But it is the fact that Ségolène Royal has risen to the fore leading to Nicolas Sarkozy to come clean.
Quite the contrary, the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is obvious is what leads many people to claim the PS to organize the battle ahead of schedule.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, voters prefer right-François Fillon at candidacy of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a UMP candidate and there is no discussion on the issue," immediately reacted cautiously to the Prime Minister environment.
"If you think you lose, do not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"I always think I can win," he corrects Alain Juppe, resigned to the evidence.
Euro, the ECB is forced to keep their purchases of Free State
The last meeting of the Board of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) for the year should help clarify the arrangements for ending the crisis or at least announce the termination of a large number of operations unconventional monetary policy should be completed in late year.
Because of the crisis of European sovereign debt, the bank of Frankfurt certainly can not afford to be so assertive or risk to aggravate a situation more complicated today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be just as high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, has supported the active role played by the ECB for resolving the debt crisis of the European states.
He would not say whether it considered that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its purchase program of state obligations.
"I reserve my opinion to my fellow Europeans ...."
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, was no more eloquent about his intentions, saying only that the purchase program State Bills in the secondary market "continued" and that "we'll see what we decided" during Thursday's meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009 story.
In practice, the acquisition of treasury bonds by the ECB has more than doubled last week to reach about 1,350 million euros.
Moreover, according to prying market players have bought again yesterday Irish and Portuguese titles.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased securities amounting to 67,000 million euros since May 2010.
Among market participants, not the least doubt that they will continue the purchases (see page 29).
Economists do not foresee any significant changes in direction.
Although lending operations more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, it still performs assignments unlimited liquidity beneficial conditions and durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device is now extended for several months.
"I can not imagine going to significantly change its program."
"If not, run the risk of causing new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"It seems more probable that an outflow progressive announced during the first quarter of 2011," Norbert expected by his side Brams, an economist at Sal
Oppenheim.
In relation to the action in the public debt market, the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of such obligations for the market to remain stable, "says Norbert Brams.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to the sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the bank of no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"You have to make at any price the lack of investors in the market and act in a manner that will prevent a marked rise in yields paid by fragile states," says manager yesterday an important obligations.
Because if interest rates are set by the clouds, states will have even more problems to reduce its debts, or even to stabilize.
This is the price to protect the euro.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government weathers the storm
After Italy had started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with reflux of bond rates to 10 years.
A precarious calm recovery.
On leaving a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have claimed that they heard Giulio Tremonti qualify the situation as "indecipherable" and expected a weekend "unpredictable," subsequently denied statements by the applicant.
In any case, the difference Tuesday with the German long-term rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of contracts to hedge against the risk of bankruptcy (CRC) had shot up 263 points, triggering a a stir in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi said that in Spain, the difference was higher German rates to 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, said he was "deeply concerned" by "market turmoil" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is it's like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, your problem is the lack of growth and stagnation of revenue associated with it, causing the state at risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
It is estimated that the Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being considered by the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2, 7%).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions could be applied after the holidays in an amount of 7,000 million euros.
"If necessary, they must take further austerity measures," says Economic Affairs Commissioner, Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of the economy are in order and their accounts in good standing, as we have been saying for some time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian manager in the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy in the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, editor's note), requested the stabilization efforts in Italy are lower than those required for other countries "said Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
There remains the problem of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a censure motion in the House of Representatives, after which elections could be anticipated in late March.
In this case, it would open a period not conducive to making decisions in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening mechanisms to combat crisis
Christine Lagarde and repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I think we've shown on Sunday night and by day, the Europeans are clearly supportive, committed, committed to defending its currency and of the currency area. "
Although it was on, the relaxation recorded yesterday in the rates of the obligations of European states has prompted governments and the ECB.
However, we can not yet speak of a principle of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced it would lower the debt ratings of Portugal, the most frequent target of speculation today.
"As in May, actually lack clarity and transparency policies, which weighs significantly on banking systems," say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "the political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets."
Aware of this gap and hidden dangers, European countries intensified the debates to reinforce the mechanisms of exit from the existing crisis.
Informal consultations between the Ministers of Finance who are most directly affected and, in general, with their counterparts in the G-20 are on track.
And this also taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin in early next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the kind of unconventional measures to support countries in the euro area in the sights of the market (see above).
In regard to the European Financial Stability (FEEF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday in Singapore a tour of Asia to inform investors of the Far East on the news of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not fundraising, no doubt prepared the ground.
It is anticipated that the first issues of titles FEEF take place next month.
Yesterday a U.S. official representative entrusted with Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in funds raised through additional direct involvement of the IMF.
As for countries that are at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in relation to the organization of the labor market.
These reforms are in addition to the austerity measures with an effect closer.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move down a different path which was followed by Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid at all costs seek international assistance before applying its own corrections budget and decide on structural reforms considered essential to increase confidence in a lasting way.
The backers of European funds, finally, we show the options available to accelerate the process of standardization of public bond markets.
Passing through Paris on November 24, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that if the 750,000 million mobilized from Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to return to his wallet .
Economists at Barclays Capital, a major actor in the market for European government debt, consider that an amount of around 100,000 million euros more would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
There is a tool for this: the European financial stabilization mechanism, now endowed with 60,000 million euros.
A board that, without doubt, could examine in detail the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
The snowfalls are causing difficulties of movement, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sevres and Vienne had joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday at noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall affecting northern Gironde and Charentes, although light snow in Ile de France.
Expected snow layers between 2 and 5 cm, time of between 7 and 10 cm in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The departments affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Lower Normandy, Ile de France and Limousin.
Snowfall is strong enough to cause difficulty of movement and affect some economic activities, warning Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, has been banned from several roads department to heavy goods vehicles over 7.5 tonnes, including axes Guingamp, Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
According to police, the movement in the secondary network in Britain is complicated, so they recommend not driving except in cases of necessity, and has banned the movement of certain vehicles TER during the day.
Throughout Thursday, the school has banned the transport in Picardy.
He had not planned any specific action on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "urges all motorists to drive with extreme caution on the roads and adapt their driving to the situation."
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) asked the airlines on Thursday quashed the 25% of its flights at Paris Roissy and Orly 10% because of the snow expected.
The DGAC recommended that passengers should contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: first drafts financial
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in the Ile de France has reached its peak, raining billions.
At least in the debate.
In particular, spoke of the 23,000 million for the Paris Grand meter should build the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the Government has announced an allocation of 4,000 million euros.
At the theoretical level, this amount will subsequently allowing the SGP to borrow in the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, finally, we have the first account.
The Finance Act, 2010 amendment, discussed in the finance committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the devices provided to find the first part of that money.
There are two modes: the creation of a special tax on equipment and increased tax offices in the Isle of France.
The first, as stated in Article 15 of the text of the bill is "the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
It is also set in numbers: "The proceeds of this tax is 117 million euros a year."
The second is a modification of a tax on existing offices "to modernize, increase their product and allocate that increase to the Société du Grand Paris."
How obtained with this method?
Who knows.
The text does not give figures.
But far from 4,000 million.
"It is clear that fiscal resources are added to the 4,000 million euros of financial resources to mobilize the state and to be awarded to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," we read in the preamble.
The GSP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment you create revenues (both taxes, editor's note), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4,000 million later, they said."
"It was recorded in the budget and be used according to need."
The GSP estimates will begin to receive the 4,000 million in 2013 to the 2014 budget.
This device, which promised 4,000 million credit not listed, may cause a slight parliamentary debate on.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Avengers diligent hackers and spies
WikiLeaks Case has a double value.
On the one hand, reveals a seeming scandal, a scandal that just seems outrageous to the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, announced sweeping changes at the international level and provides a future dominated by the regression.
But let's step by step.
WikiLeaks The first aspect is the confirmation of the fact that each record created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which he belongs) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" U.S. revelations about the sexual mores of Berlusconi only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and the profile of Khadafi sinister mocking longstanding giving ideas to artists cabaret to create their sketches.
The rule that only the secret files should be formed by news audience is essential to understanding the dynamics of the secret services, not just in this century.
If you visit a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that every work repeated (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars and the Rosicrucians) exactly what was written in earlier works.
This is not due solely to the authors of occult texts unpublished research will not do (or do not know where to look for updates on the nonexistent), but because those involved in the occult not only rely on what they already know, which reconfirms that they had already learned.
This is the mechanism for the success of Dan Brown.
The same applies to the secret files.
The reporter is lazy, as lazy (or have little desire) the head of the secret services (if it could be, I do not know, editor of Libération), which only considers true what they can recognize.
Top secret information on Berlusconi who sent the U.S. embassy in Rome to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the previous week.
So why have caused such a stir the revelations of these records?
On the one hand, just say what every educated person knows, that is, embassies, at least since the Second World War and since the Heads of States may be called by telephone or catch a plane to meet for dinner, have lost its diplomatic function, except for some limited exercise performance, have become centers of espionage.
Any viewer watching movies knows what research, just pretend we do not know hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact publicly repeated breach of duty and gives hypocrisy a bad image of U.S. diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker can see the secrets any more secrets in the world's most powerful country greatly affects the prestige of the Department of State.
Therefore, the scandal affects both victims and "perpetrators."
But get into the true nature of what happened.
Formerly, in Orwell's time, could conceive of any power as a Big Brother controlling every movement of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, controlling every move thanks to the phone, every transaction, hotel visited highway taken, the city thus became a victim of the eye full of power.
But when it is shown, as now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power can not escape the control of a hacker, the relationship ceases to be unidirectional control and becomes circular.
Power controls for each citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, who was elected as the avenger of the people) can know all the secrets of power.
How can you put up with a power that can not even keep their own secrets?
It is true, as I said Georg Simmel, a real secret is a secret empty (and empty a secret can never be revealed) but it is true that all knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi and Merkel is actually a secret vacuum without secret, since it comes from the public, but revealing, as it has WikiLeaks, which Hillary Clinton's secrets were secret empty means taking away all power.
WikiLeaks has not done any harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but, much to Clinton and Obama.
What are the consequences of the injury caused to one so powerful?
It is clear that in the future, and states may not place any sensitive information network, as it would like to publish a poster in the street.
But it is also clear that with current technology, you can not expect to keep your conversations confidential.
Nothing is more easy to discover if and when a Head of State was moved by plane and has been in touch with one of the counterparts.
How will the future hold private and confidential relationships?
I am aware that, for now, my prediction is the stuff of science fiction and therefore fictional, but I imagine government agents moving discreetly in uncontrollable paths errands, carrying messages to be memorized or at most, hiding some data written on the heels of his shoes.
That information is then kept in a single copy in locked drawers, after all, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I wrote that the technology is now moving like a crab, ie backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has become to create a telegraph cables (phone).
The Videotape (analog) had allowed researchers to study film a movie step by step, advancing and retreating, unlocks the secrets of editing, but now the CD (digital) only move you from chapter to chapter , ie, to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while aircraft movements involved with, we need three hours.
Therefore, it is not unusual that the policy and communication technologies will lead us back to the carriages.
One last comment.
Formerly, the press tried to understand what was being plotted in secret in embassies.
Currently, the embassies are requesting confidential information to the press.
Climate: the bungling of France in their promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen agreement, it is time to consider whether restrictions on funding pledges quickly unlocked (called fast start or early) made by developed countries.
And they have revealed the bungling French.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries pledged to provide U.S. $ 30,000 million between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged 7,200 million euros in three years and France EUR 1,260 million (ie, 420 million per year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has put on the table their best cards to convince their partners that their commitment to financing fast start is true: a report detailing the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a major side event, the distribution of leaflets ...
Transparent operation and significant result was appreciated for what really matters: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries do the same and the same level of accuracy.
The EU announced that it has released 2010 2.200 million, which puts it on track towards meeting its commitment of 7,200 million in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that additional efforts are made without prejudice to the ODA.
Unfortunately, there has been no agreement on what "new and additional.
When the European Commission proposed a harmonization, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Currently, each choosing the most convenient reference.
For example, the European Commission has taken as the base year 2009: maintaining international funding and added 150 million over three years in funding fast start.
Other countries have chosen similar references in regard to year or at the level of official development assistance.
By contrast, France considers that funding for "all new projects" of 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to previous years' expenditures and the overall level of official development aid.
Specifically, the total amount of French aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while pretending to respect their commitments with regard to fund "new and additional" ...
Another crucial element, the breakdown between grants and loans.
Once again, there is no standard and each choosing the method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that every dollar borrowed donated equals one euro.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to reducing emissions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro to be recovered as equivalent to a euro that donate ... At best, only should be computed for the cost of their loan commitments to the country granting the loan (ie, equivalent to an interest rate).
But France is not useful such reasoning: "respect" its commitment of 420 million euros by 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of gifts (36.1 million euros); see the EU to see with his own eyes.
It is the only EU country that uses so often the loan.
Germany is used by 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments to 100% of donations.
In other words, when most of the European Union provides a euro to fulfill its commitment, France contributes only ten cents and believes that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In summary, in its funding fast start, France is a double abuse: first, in relation to actions in time and, secondly, in relation to the actual financial outlay.
Spending only 36.1 million euros, manages to give the impression that spends 420 million "new and additional" as promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (Bercy think it's because he has dealt with the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States to continue to donate when they can simply borrow?) As in negotiations, as developing countries are not stupid ...
The chapter on finance is a trifle early, relatively short time, under all the climate negotiations.
But it might be a grain of sand over the vast machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Hopefully not.
Whatever, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could herald a change in its method of calculation for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention to respect its commitments and the same way as the other European Union countries.
But, especially, France could make further discussions on the stakes at play in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter is currently under discussion): do not get rid of the issue of "additionality" and the method compute loans.
France could change its position to become so progressive on this issue as it is with others.
Therefore, we can only hope the new Minister of Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who come to Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about the fast start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of the loans would improve the confidence level needed to advance international negotiations.
Warning about the pesticides ingested by children
A 10 year old boy eat a day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published on Wednesday Générations Futures Association (the old movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a statistical significant considering the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problems addressed," Oise purchased in supermarkets and Paris between July and September food often consume a boy about ten years in four meals and a snack daily.
These meals taken as a model that follow the official recommendations (five portions of fruit and vegetables, dairy products and three of 1.5 liters of water a day) and sweets, were examined in the laboratory for chemical , pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as carcinogenic insurance, as well as 37 substances which can act as endocrine disrupters (PE), according to research by various institutions such as International Centre for Research on Cancer.
"Although in almost all cases, not exceed the legal limits for each of the individual chemicals, our study clearly shows that exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic pollutants and / or PE is worrying," says the association.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk alone contains more than a dozen potential carcinogenic residues and three insurance considered carcinogenic, as well as about twenty residues can disrupt the hormonal system.
Apples, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack for school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including in food, in which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the Russian steak, canned tuna and even a loaf of bread or gum were adorned with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, the analysis found the presence of nitrate and chloroform.
At dinner, the slice of salmon was the most "nutritious" chemical residues detected with 34 and even the analysis of the plastic plate used for heating food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk that create these "cocktail of pollutants" consumer "is probably underestimated," says the study.
Ecology European Alliance Les Verts (EE-LV), meanwhile, has proposed "against the seriousness of the situation" a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases of civilization."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
