No liberating novella for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused the request to remove a revision of the Penal Code those paragraphs, was convicted on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko.
The new rules, which could pave the way for the release of the detained Expremierministerin would, rejected the Members of the second reading of the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was in October due to the conclusion of a supposedly harmful treaty with Russia on the purchase of natural gas has been sentenced to seven years in prison.
The verdict is not yet final in December is the appeal of the convicted in court.
Timoshenko even described the verdict as a political revenge of the regime and also in the west of the process raises the suspicion of bias of the court.
The amendment, paragraph 365, was convicted on the basis of the Expremierministerin to remove from the penal code, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been to its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion knows about their losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now, to define the winner.
As this region, win in the elections Islamists, the only question is which - the moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council, the customary law, which is now a certain idea of God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft peck out of hand.
Women should forget about emancipation as soon as possible, any faith apostates executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator is united society from mutually abandoned tribes from the Koran.
In short - in Libya will be a system that would be hard to imagine here and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and not objectively the best and would change the Libyans hardly mentioned.
It is rather strange that the Muslim fighters from the infidel dogs help.
In their defence, may serve only the fact that NATO's bombardments by any General from America, but by Allah, was hailed the omnipotence of every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We were only in a shooting incident, served the interests of Islam and our politicians getting in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any benefit.
After the fresh and bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we saw more of a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the Hiesigen a concern - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
The oil companies but also without occupation black gold to the silver?
Hardly, and so can the West finally have the right to boast his selflessness in the protection of human rights.
If they do not spoil the Scharīʿa representatives.

The menu of fettsüchtigen child: eating breakfast and not eating for dinner sausage
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9% of all pupils and 5 percent of children are overweight.
Recent opinion polls proved - obese children come from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
It shows once again how important it is for the healthy development of a human being is the milieu in which he breeds and examples that surrounded him.
On the tables adipöser children are sausages to a half more frequently on the table, as in families where normalgewichtige children.
More than 19 percent of overweight children were on the eve of the awareness campaign under the slogan "obesity is not a coincidence" chips for dinner.
In families with Dickerchen is not just the favourite sports activities, but also affects the majority of today's pupils - only 15 percent said that their parents at least once a week for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was carried out last year by the end of the school year, were interviewed nearly 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of action "obesity is not a coincidence ," which is supported by the general insurance company and the company Unilever.
To date, the project more than 12 thousand pupils from 4th and 8th classes.
Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family are key factors for the alarming increase in the number of children who are overweight or obesity.
"Only half of the surveyed children, for example, five times a day to eat breakfast in the mode of breakfast, lunch Vesper dinner - one of the main conditions for a healthy diet," is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relatively minor matters, such as the regular breakfast time the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic but only 23 percent of the families of the students.
And, in most families eating breakfast alone.
The worst was the observation that in every tenth family not eating at all.
Breakfast is the cornerstone of healthy daily diet.
The survey test, among other things, the day that the families of obese children consumed more often unhealthy chips.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight, drinking sweet drinks every day (70%) 
Although more than 40 percent of the surveyed children's sports, but only less than half their parents do, only 15%.
If you your own menu together
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), from opportunities offered to appetite and view their own menu.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition, is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favourite foods were many flour foods, meat dishes and, of course, fresh food.
"What is alarming is the great popularity of sweet drinks," stresses in the final report on the poll.
At lunch, so the main court, pasta just before poultry.
Pulses disliked the children, and the popularity of fish and vegetables courts as lunch was very low.
Hinkehr to health
At the same time, the survey showed that the children are willing to change their eating habits, if they have the right information.
"In the control group of survey participants, the questionnaire after the conclusion of the informative lecture" obesity is not a coincidence "that, in many cases, a significant shift preferences to principles of healthy diet," is in the results of the project.
This was evident in the sweet Limos, for example, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children crossed paths in the questionnaire also much more poultry or fish as a main course of the day and were ready to less dumplings or sugary foods.
Experts say - a Stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how Stylisten learn, I had a little bit that it was a bit too much fuel for the start.
Because I was not at all, what is to come.
Lectures by three experts from the industry, the clothing and problematic characters and a seminar on how the "Square ."
It is worse to come.
The closer examination, the more information and practical challenges before us.
But even if the rate each on Saturdays and Sundays, he is nevertheless fully documented.
This time we debated with Director Ethyl (the rate is not a single man participating), as a woman who has no ideal proportionierte figure.
And these are, after all, most of us.
A have a short neck, the other a jungenhafte figure without proper curves and others are mollig.
It is a matter of Stylisten broad shoulders look better to extend the neck or conjuring up the necessary curves.
We also clues to how a type of women like Jennifer Lopez - with a great deal of Finland, a hip and thinner waists - attracts nicely and figurbetont, without being too provocative.
If, for example, the difference between waists and hips is so great that really suits, the skirt or trousers should be at least a piece of that.
This will not regret it, because good sedentary clothing is simply unaffordable.
In such a tailor-made rock you feel much better than in a, verrutscht constantly high and, in the absteht waists, etc.
Jungenhafte characters can in turn, clothing with wrinkles, Bauschen, applications, embroidery or Raffung.
In this quantity of information and character types, I am glad that I have a whole week time, carefully go through the head.
And yet I fear that to create the House assigned task.
Each of the course was a celebrity, for which they should devise appropriate attire - day and evening gown.
Should we take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the stars and the type of type.
I should Miranda Kerr "attract ," which you may be familiar from the campaign Victoria's Secret.
Within juble I, because it is for me personally, much better than, for example, Britney Spears or attract Christina Aguilera, which has increased in the last time the hundred kilograms (never mind that this is a bit exaggerated), or the young Selena Gomez.
The clothes are we from magazines ausschneiden or on the Internet, print, and then deal with graphically.
In the Mood "Board ," as a result, then our personal style and our relationship to the graphic design.
It is also very important to reflect on the side of the graphic Stylings.
The Stylist model is not only physically, but also the so-called product page in the magazine (for specific target, for example, trend handbags, coats, etc.).
It told us the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But the only on Sunday.
This means that a Stylist a good overview.
With information on the types of characters angefüllte Saturday presentation was peppered from three visitors from the industry:
The Stylisten Jan Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and a Stylist should be able to take advantage of this.
And eingeschickter Stylist able to work with a single piece of clothing in a different way.
The magic word is variability.
For example, a Trenchcoat as usual on the jeans, a T-shirt or coat, you can but also on the naked body, (shoes to attract and hire him as a dress.
It is, the sleeves or the collar sleeves and, the whole look quite different.
"So," he said.
Most came to me but the following advice: "Think you know the rules perfect."
"Only then can they violate them," said Jakub.
At last, it is clear to me why we need to all these theories, which can be combined with what and why, even if on display in fashion journals often quite different.
Not to mention of fashion look.
Thanks to the photographer Ben I know now that must have prepared a Stylist much more clothing options when he ultimately photographed.
So it must be for a Fashion story with ten pages (read ten attire) be prepared to stylen at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes quite differently than in reality.
With all of that is so in shaping the attire.
That image and Styl sometimes half the success that we also confirmed Jan Pokorný.
You need only to look at Madonna, not just a brilliant singer, have made the image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic is the services of Stylisten rather reserved.
Even celebrities often believe that this is wasted money (the main thing is that I am, how I au naturel secondary).
And if stylen itself any of us, then we expect that he or she is likely a different (smaller) imposing size, as he or she really needs.
We need to googlen then only to determine with certainty that the tabloid press writes, the celebrity have again or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario laid on Sunday, not to believe that a Stylist to focus only on the fashion and then the cloth "assemble" needs.
In his work, he must communicate with the people he stylt and he must be a psychologist.
People judge without curry and, in his opinion.
"If any manager to sift through their clothes, and to complement beautiful pieces, then it does not remove the entire cupboard - my God, this is terrible."
"We must find at least a few good things, which recommends what to take it," says Mario.
He also showed us exactly what a so-called "pocket" must include.
So a bag that zuknöpft the waists and bears in all necessary Proprietäten.
In such clear terms, such as scissors, Abroller for hair removal or safety needles, it also contains Utensilien, as a nylon thread (thus helps the Stylist the photographing of products such as handbags or meting out from), specific clips, which tightened up the clothes, if it is too big (Stecknadeln or other Klemmen are banned, so that the substance is not broken) and, of course, Nähzeug.
So we have to listen to, but not only, but also can try something, we learned how to unterklebt shoes.
The photography studio, where the floor, can be destroyed the base, let alone the outside world.
Us o klebten and klebten we...
With the gap even affect the shoes are not allowed to, so that they are not damaged.
So we really have to be sent.
Mario enjoyed myself, my "Commissioner-delegate praised without restrictions.
This skill is not just my strength.
All this was only a fraction of what we hear on the second weekend continuation rate.
One thing has become clear to me - the styling to address at a professional level, is not a children's game.
V Need for steroids: "The run" - The illegal race across America
Recession
The original reckless journey through a series of entirely preventable, dilettantish error on a routine trip to the class.
It was, in large part to fulfil the ambitions, but what is the point when obviously had no desire to do a bit more.
Even before he came to the shop tables, the new part, with the subtitle "the run" high expectations.
He promised that the able games series" Need for steroids" in a new dimension to postpone and the spielbaren examples to demonstrate he seemed actually to be not only one of many Action Rennspielen.
We were also curious to know how the eingepassten passages in which the main protagonist is rising from the car and on foot.
But how NFS is so accustomed to, in essence, is much different than we had expected.
Sure - are potentially quite decent Arkade race, but will reduce the risk of some unnecessary mistakes that are in this series more or less for a few years.
So there are actually no more mistakes, but rather in principle, signs of incomprehensible laziness of the games developers.
The adventure begins very well.
History will be in the first instance, whose main character Jack introduced certain problems personal nature; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, set the wheel - with the task to be first in New York.
The basic idea involves a number of interesting elements.
The whole route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty individual race.
This means that every race with each other, and that the various stages in different sufficiently different and interesting environment.
No one has the impression that the game would offer the same.
Some areas are still very attractive, although the technical level of graphics on the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing earth-shattering news.
But the trip through the desert, through herbstliche landscape or high by deep verschneite landscape we visually very pleasant.
Occasionally bring atypical elements a little change in the individual race.
In the desert, for example, is surprised by a desert storm, which reduces the term.
In the mountains, in turn, you have to be careful step that will not be buried by an avalanche.
Incidentally, are fairly well in the individual race.
Only a few, but they are.
For a while trying to overtake the mandatory number of opponents (in principle a classic race), it has to make up time (classic race against the stopwatch), then expect a personal duel with a single counterparty.
And this is also the police, who wants to blow the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaving the car.
It is more about some interactive animation, in which Jack fleeing from anyone and where he must help the players, he is the right moment the right button.
So nothing complicated.
Surprisingly, however, that the game is much less such passages, as one would expect (actually only three).
Ultimately, this is the case with the advantage, because it has this element at least a chance to be boring - it is in the context of the high point of the elements that make the game sweeteners.
The Fahrmodell is progressing in the Fußtapfen of previous parts.
This means that from today's point of view, there are no trees, on the other hand, could not be said that it would be bad.
Those who seek realistic simulations, must look elsewhere.
But an aktionsgeladenen Rennfahren the European Fahrmodell continue quite well, although it could be found in the competition.
Until then, everything is peachy.
Real problems arise only after a certain time.
Unlike Fahrmodell is not the collision model quite OK.
This type of a game is hardly to be expected that complicated deformities and collisions calculated, but if you have virtually no impact on any object idea as to how the car, then obviously not everything is in order.
Case in point: the close do so or those driving to oncoming cars "scratches" on the other cars only slightly, in others, almost identical situation, but went into a tailspin, and wild pirouetting.
Or the Karre to scrap.
Thanks to the rest of the system makes nothing, annoying is it all the time.
The rest of Arts are resolved that, if it has destroyed or far away from the route ends up, then the game back to the last point of reference.
Only - in every race has only five rest of Arts.
If they have been exhausted, everything is starting from scratch.
The rest of Arts, rather as a tool in the event that something does not succeed, but we prefer not to rely on.
Sometimes helps but not the rest of nature, and nothing other than the critical section from the head to learn.
Extremely unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves must pass through, for example, in a very specific way, otherwise it is not easy.
Elsewhere, the relevant department "civilian" cars are in the same configuration, regardless of whether the first or fifth, five seconds sooner or a minute later.
This is particularly galling in situations when you see that the Kontrahent before a romped to two oncoming cars, but until you arrive, the cars are already in such a position that they must slow down or avoid it.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, everything is designed so that this situation is always close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the game, there are a few places where it is being overtaken by the same opponents at the same point and again regardless of the time.
The Madman Estonians, this is at the end of the game in the long bridge in opposite direction.
The Kontrahent must clearly hell bent on overtake.
And if he is just a, then it is, of course, the point of view, so we drove there initially by car a few times in Klump.
Clearly, it is simply the game more exciting and more exciting but it is clear that spoiled them quickly the joy of the game.
And that is a pity, because despite a simpler Fahrmodell is aktionsgeladen the game as a whole rather entertaining and sometimes so that we do not know almost more, where one of the head.
And, in principle, no matter what "responsible" - the concept of fifty unique routes, the Order of the race in a way that can avoid boredom, or something else...
An unusual idea is also the change in the course of the race.
We must not overlook the petrol station on the road, because that's where you can change the car, although in most cases the car enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for the alternate motorways and exotic super sports cars for technical operations, such as the Serpentinen in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the way the game's history is also the tasks mode (challenges) - the race in the premises of history.
There is not only medals, but also to gain experience points for their own profile, together for the tasks (challenges) and history.
In order to reach a higher level, drivers must be different items, ranging from cars to the Backgrounds for the profile.
This is linked to the online function Autolog at the same time, among other things, its own results compared with those of other players and also for further collective functions.
One of the more incomprehensible Schnitzern is a situation last race in history.
Here is one with the car in a subway tunnel (I), where desecrate kept in the dark on the rail for (or).
On the speed dial look between paragraphs 150 (a) 200 km/h (or), but it is suddenly from behind a subway and a drive to scrap.
In our editorial will argue we probably still have a long time about whether a blackout of the game makers, or keep the authors so stupid.
The technical side is nothing Überwältigendes but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases, appealing and sometimes even brilliant.
Even more galling is that some exciting moments the Bildwiederholfrequenz slows and sometimes quite dramatically.
However, this is in particular the accidents with greater number of parties, where a continuous FPS useless anyway.
The Tonwiedergabe is OK and the Sound Track is taste.
In a bid to such a broad scale as possible rather young audience, created a Sound Track a lá "from any something" - but anyone who buys such a game because of the music?
The overall impression of Need for steroids: the run? The feelings are more mixed.
If the game is not offset by the aforementioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we would have of conviction can claim that the run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But the game somehow unfinished.
For a great pleasure, but we should be prepared for the fact that these mistakes with the power of airport lights in the eye.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation of Negativisten and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance among the various institutions felt out of kilter."
I would not expect such a hard war flares. "
"It will take five to six years, until the dust settles and we have all become accustomed to their new role," began girl Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, in her lecture at the law faculty.
How seriously it takes the motto "Verständlich and openly about Europe ," they showed in the first part of their presentation, in which it was able to describe the various EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way to describe that some editor of the University of Karlsruhe might envy.
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"Initially, criticism that he is too low-key - a grey officer, was incapable of such a role, but I must say that it has brought all the time, as well he has taken up the cause.
"He is a person who is ready to listen to twenty-seven member states patiently, communicate with and has particularly clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said they then the answer to the question: Who is this - the European Union? What number to I call? ," as an important step towards integration and better visibility of the EU's Policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to our Ölmützer Quargel ban
Mrs Vicenová was also on the agenda, the of the European Union, and intends to live in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago, describing it as a success.
The Czechs had handled the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The case of the government during the Presidency, describing it as a major negative, which have damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
In the words of the ambassador said, it was not only the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis, which is not yet quite hectic.
And it must be approved the seven-year EU budget, which makes it precisely because of the current economic situation much more complicated.
Whether it is a slim and thrifty budget, which will take precedence which countries more or less - all of that is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls their own slogans with which they came to Brussels: "Verständlich on Europe."
"If I do not, then it know acronym, foreign words and jargon that nobody understands.
How should I know as citizens, whether in Brussels or round really curly cucumbers and variable bananas dream if someone really wants to ban the Quargel.
They had used the soil of the EU, in order to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two different speeds or in prospect
The EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation to be Eurosceptics, the more the negative than positive sides of the issue.
Even more galling is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
There are many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, whose inability to write letters and motivation, the weak support for the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency emphasised the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and the Slovaks in the vicinity, believes the Frenchman next to me:" Hey, what is their heads together - is once again your V4? "and it makes a pretty face acid.
Mrs Vicenové according to the EU in the future, especially hard rules for the budgetary policy of the member states.
As a much fairer, as a "European federation" is the concept of an Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have here the eurozone countries and the countries outside the euro zone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute, fully cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that should cooperate only the countries that want it and those who do not want to stand aside."
"There will be more and more of these institutions, which ultimately leads to a strong" multi-speed Europe ," "Mrs Vicenová expected.
In this regard, they also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the whole of the EU by all member states, and only by the countries of the euro zone.
Fire story:
The innovator IBM enters into its second century of its existence
They wanted to look for a suitable word that characterized the strategy of IBM most closely, then this would be the word "longevity."
For the general public is IBM synonymous with technological revolution, it is known as a modern businesses, although a century has passed since its establishment.
The basis of this longevity, already presented its first chief - the visionary Thomas j. Watson.
Already he considered the slogan, countless were easily solve global problems, if people were willing to consider a bit.
His slogan "Think!" was the brand, the lives of future giants should take place (and at the same time, the title of intra-group magazine which IBM in 1935 began).
This was also the basis of the Watsen thoroughly prepared business culture.
"For us from IBM means this long-term thinking a kontinuelle movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also an entire century, because it has remained faithful to its principles and not shied away from everything else around it.
The allowed us, in the course of the first century, the technologies, the business and to transform the society.
We hope that we create in the next hundred years or more, "said Samuel j. Palmisano, the director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary today.
Educational system
Watson was already in the thirties social care of its employees - in a similar way, as the company Baa in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had as one of the first American workers paid holidays, an insurance through the employer plus elegant uniforms and working clothes and a reasonable salary system for best innovators and traders.
As more sophisticated IBM's long-term relationships with their customers.
The company was brilliant in the talent from the outset - as one of the first companies in the world, IBM any discrimination - and could choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, will invariably the Palmisan at the head of IBM next year by a woman - of Virginia Rometty.
It is thirty years by IBM, have so far adopted the position of the Vetriebs, head of marketing and strategy.
IBM makes in recent years, so-called online brainstorming session, from which stem many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - there is no shortage of ideas, the company employs is almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Their strong position in the Business guaranteed the company a strong image and after internal and external.
"From the beginning, IBM, the concept of an institution, rather than a mere technology company," said the Economist, a professor at Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that the business problems through technology helps solve," added George Colony of Consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself, there is a difference, to be on the market only present or molding him through this presence directly.
IBM - in the states of their logos for family "Big Blue ," has grown up in a century to one of the largest companies in the world.
It is one of the militaries developed technology companies - IBM hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible breadth of products - ranging from servers to nanotechnology.
Most of all American technology company IBM patents and five of his staff were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Among his best-known inventions include, for example, bank machines, credit cards, financial swaps, bar code or diskette.
With approximately $220 billion stock market value (market capitalization) was the second largest technology company IBM in this year (after Apple), and for the first time since 1996, Microsoft obsolete.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations, the tastes of the customers of today - were unhappy with its own operating system, for example, the attempt OS / 2, the online service Prodigy or the computer IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, should not be emotionell tied to the past," says Samuel j. Palmisano.
It has no problem, to build its ground on various platforms - and if they are not going to leave it.
Unlike the opponent, Microsoft, which in principle with its Windows operating system.
Ie technologies
In the profits of IBM participate to the greatest extent services, software and hardware to participate in a fifth.
It was still 1990 hardware with a more than fünfzigprozentigem share.
Since 2000, IBM veräußerte little profit without assets worth $15 billion, at the same time, however, it has invested $58 billion in buying promising technologies.
In these investments continued IBM after 2008, when swept the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept the world.
Here too, IBM, the legacy of his first boss Thomas j. Watson, the increase in the midst of the major world economic crisis his investment.
So far, it appears that the company survives IBM today's crisis.
The value of the IBM shares rose since 2008 raketenartig at 120 percent and the profit of the company is growing kontinuell.
IBM's corporate slogan is: not everything can be changed - only the values.
Also, to be expected that resolves this flexible giant the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese Schneider to outer space flights
The society, founded a hundred years ago in New York International Business Machines (IBM) initially had a rather complicated names - computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took over until 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
Laid the foundation for subsequent society IBM the merger of four companies, whose history until the 80 s of the 19 st century.
They owned technologies such as the famous Stechkartenuhren registration work begins and endes.
The architects of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, which until 1930 had also holds the presidency of the supervisory board.
And it was Flint, the head of the rival firm Thomas j. Watson, so that helped him with the management of the company.
This Leader, then even the founder of IBM in the shadow of Watson's ideas to date the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, which betrays the name, with the creation and distribution of all sorts of machines for trade - of sausages and cheese tailors to cash.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he has doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company is expanding gradually on all continents.
Watson was so essential to the company that he was in the director's chair for a whole forty years, until he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson junior.
Leading IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first Programmiersprache.
In the 60 s helped engineers and computer from IBM NASA flights into space - the Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969, the famous flight of people to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM in 1964, the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM system / 360.
A classic PC, certain of the computer standard of the time, came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later veräußerte IBM computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand, they bought the consul aunts part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and hereby fully in the business of Consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy pays off in the last three years, as is the concept of "Smarter planet."
It is the intention to use technology in a wise manner in hitherto not even planned areas, for example, to improve the situation in urban transport and administration.
In the commercial sector, IBM introduced recently the platform "Smarter commerce," which is supposed to help dealers, the whole trade cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932, IBM established a branch in what was then Czechoslovakia - the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR, among other things, a strategic outsourcing centers in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe in Prague and is also a top team of world class that deals with the technology of voting detection.

The worst female vices: what's with you?
If the men to mention some typical female vices, then shake them all some promptly from the sleeves.
The women, you can see in the following pages, in which a few Unsitten review, the men's blood in the veins?
Einkaufssucht
Her husband to be einkaufssüchtig?
You have to buy at least one pusillanimity every week?
You like to go shopping, and it must be a little more in action?
It is in your case really is a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping mood reasonably under control.
But hand on heart, that it has to bummeln not in search of a good front upper clothing only through a clothes shop and all (in every possible colour combinations) test in the booth?
Even if it is shopping for most women a hobby, for men, it is often the pure hell.
They have to see how often she said her husband - you prefer to stay out there...
Permanent discontent
"I am not too fat?"
"I should be at least five kilograms - should I start to go jogging or Gymnastik?"
"I liked you?"
Is familiar to them somehow?
Yes?
Then you belong to the women, who are truly obsessed with how they look.
This does not necessarily mean that you should go, but many men allergic respond when their woman constantly whinges about their appearance.
The stronger sex is agreed - with increasing frequency of complaints are women always unverträglicher.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Windows clean sweep, tiles and dust, scheuern the tub - and this at least twice a week.
Grumbles you with their partner because he again with dirty shoes to clean tiles trample you chastise the child, because it is gescheuerte washing basin already bad, because the glass door in the living room cabinet again fingerprints, which the of so much trouble?
Should you suffer from this kind of "Devianz" suffer, then you should know that nothing can exaggerate and the order and cleanliness in family life.
This excessive Reinheitsfimmel can ultimately hurt the mutual relations and, above all, the rest of the family.
Enjoys taunting
"Dirty Turnhosen in the laundry basket."
"You want to attract the old socks really tomorrow again?"
"Not simply a watery towel, on the ground."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised to see him at the Palme.
It is not so bad, they want to just that everything is in order.
If the men knew this, then the women may not quite so much to grumble.
Schmoozing
Some women clap and tratschen like this is behind the backs getuschelt or even slander or forging alliances.
Women are focused on relations, panting like issues, such as, for example, - who, where, with whom, how and why.
I think any of us has a bit of harmless schmoozing at camp.
Hand on heart, that is all women.
This is not to be confused with gossip aunts gross calibre, which nobody and nothing is sacred, which are all around them, and especially for women's collectives a significant danger.

Development of the travel prices since 1989
By 1989, the then ČSSR only five authorized government travel agents: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agents sold only travel to the socialist bloc countries in the West were only chosen at the time.
And so, Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), in the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), after Bulgaria and Romania, the Black Sea and Hungary workplaces.
A silver exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia proposed a pro-Western course and so the trips to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of the socialist times that it was not even citizens of the Soviet bloc (including the Tschechoslowaken) was allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR individually to Poland or even wanted to travel to the Soviet Union, then he took a so-called invitation letter, otherwise were not individual trips.
Even then, travel agents and travel in the West, but then had to be huge queues in, or spend the night in sleeping bags in the travel office, or at least "good friends" in the travel office.
So was not the cause.
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit to the West - was given only "politically reliable" people - the others were allowed to travel.
Czechoslovakia's currency was not umtauschbare currency freely without foreign currency, it would have been impossible to the necessary financial resources (Western currency) find for a trip to the West.
The journey most Czechs spent their holidays at home, it is no wonder that bought the Czechs countless weekend homes and dachas - a habit that has lasted until today.
The Velvet revolution of 1989 was followed by a trip revolution of the Czechs on the foot.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things, spent the Czechs last year 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, is not aware of it, is the fact that the most popular holiday destination of the Czechs - could not travel at all until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 90 s, the foreign exchange duty in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe lifted, above all, what a huge wave of short visits to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Tschechoslowaken could not get for a long time to travel to the West simply enough, everyone wanted to have at least a few days since.
So slept the Czech holidaymakers travelling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have had at the time the money for accommodation in the hotel or a pension.
A typical feature of foreign travel by Czechs was a length of canned beer and sausages, etc. vollgepackter boot.
Another important milestone was the introduction of free umtauschbaren Czech koruna - after decades were able to buy our tourists Western currency.
Our standard of living and, consequently, the average salaries rose to what einmündete 1997 in another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel began to prepare the travel agents after 1997 regularly travel by chartered flights, making air travel, thanks to the opportunity to negotiate volume discounts, compared to the past incredibly cheap.
At the end of the 90 s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already devisenlosen payment with all advanced countries in the world, making travel easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "velvet" travel came in 2000, thanks to the high demand, when the first direct charter flight in an exotic country - after Thailand.
Every year since then fly direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers in far-off sunny countries; this year flies directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations.
The 100 Tsd. Czechs travel every year in exotic countries!
Another important moment in the era that our "post-revolutionary" marked development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the U.S. visa requirement for Czech tourists, which our country is definitely among the world's advanced countries brutalized.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time, more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they gave to a single holiday residence, including the cost of holiday destination, more than 15 Tsd CZK per capita.
The General Assembly should find a new chairman - a stalemate.
Almost five months, the Czech football no chairman and that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech football Association (FAČR) will be even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk known.
To date, there is still no agreement on what is to be elected electoral law.
And this is no vote on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his post, and he called on his colleagues in the departure had to come together and find a strong personality could run the football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek broke the old squabbles between the two associations chambers again able to agree on a common candidate.
This was clearly demonstrated on 16 September, as the new leader should be chosen.
The delegates at the General Assembly were free of the People's House in Prague quarter Smíchov come, because the negotiation led to no result and it was not only about the election itself.
We could not agree about who is in the full collection actually vote - only the statutory representative or with a power of officials.
In this single point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute for the state and the right, whose opinion representation in power base is not admissible.
The dispute over the election law, however, continue to take.
The Executive Committee did not have more clarity on the matter, whose meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle, nothing else on the agenda.
Even if the views on the election a few times - the worst point remained the same.
The question is: how can we in the 3 st round in order to avoid a stalemate?
"The point of contention is the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the statute, or whether a different model must be found," said dušan Svoboda, one of the three deputy chairman of the FAČR, representing management in professional football.
According to a registered model prevails in the third round the one candidate who receives the greater disposable support in the chamber, for which he is standing.
Moravia is reportedly ready to respond to the compromise that the one candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech Republic, on the condition that the winner of the other vote count at least a two-thirds majority.
"We have the two Vorrunden make no sense, this method would put the entire bicameral concept in question," Svoboda understands the objections of Moravian side that it would be best, not tweaking the electoral law, but to elect under current statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, even if it becomes apparent that the statutory electoral law of all the candidates most likely Pelta.
"It is my wish that largely elected under the statute."
"So that no unreasonable ersatz variants, such as at the last General Assembly," said the owner (the clubs) Victoria Plzeň, particularly Pelta abgrenzte stood for the first time and in his opinions.
Pelta but remains optimistic.
In his view, the new chairman Nymburk known and he believes that the candidates will also work together constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European football championship today would certainly help to calm the emotions."
"If the football until the euphoric wave, it is also the willingness to cooperate more," said the official from Jablonec by all three Adepten the most experience, both on a professional, and regional levels.
Rajchl is more circumspect.
"I hope to reach an agreement, but the situation is, unfortunately, is ambivalent."
"This is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts, the rules for their own purposes" fudge ." "
"It is a new block in the General Assembly cannot be ruled out."
"I hope that common sense prevails in the end," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time on the agreement of all sides.
Some negotiations should take place allegedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the generals until qualification at all.
The charter plane, fly, inter alia, Dalai boron Kučera and Rajchl after Podgorice, was not in the morning in Prague because of a technical malfunction at all, and so was urgently for a replacement variant, as part of the executive committee on the venue of the Barrage Hinspiels.
In the end, then surely the crucial meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the minister for education, youth and physical education in the country's divided parties within the largest sports associations would have liked to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: government grants, the Vertrauungswürdigkeit of Czech football and also the forthcoming General Assembly of the ČSTV the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka new direction.
Paclík in the battle for the position of chairman, because he sees no suitable candidate is
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary general meeting a strong candidate could make that all his ideas on the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) had met, he would not discuss it at all to the battle for the top position.
"If there is a good candidate, then I would fight for him and abandon the election."
"In the current situation, but failed to find such an Adepten," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík into duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, it is to prevent the alleged favourites for the election, Pelta, at the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stressed that he only if he wins the role of the chairman a year, until 2013, until the date of the proper main assembly.
In the position of chairman, he would like to hear a top managers, not too much in football events.
"I have personally spoken with some of the people in question."
"Hard to believe that some said they wanted to identify with the Czech football.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all disturbs Paclík allegedly linking Pelta's link with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association novel Berbr, a man with kontroversem reputation, which is behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
It is for this reason for Paclík unacceptable that Pelta holds the position of the chairman.
"His victory would einkonserviert and the Czech football is not making any progress at all."
"The support of Berbr, a cleverem Business Man, the football twice as bad," said Paclík.
It is also important that Pelta's name was made some time ago in connection with phone taps to the investigation in a corruption affair came from the Pelta but go unpunished.
"I do not know what the victory of Pelta (tsch.) should play football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, its previous formula, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta chairman" looks a little more calmly.
Should Paclík in Thursday's election win, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta well.
Just think of another candidate - Rajchl, had supported the Paclík before the General Assembly in October, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to which I would go."
"He has great skills."
"I could imagine him well, for example, as head of the national team."
"But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager."
"I am putting my nose in matters of which I understand nothing," said Paclík, who had been in September that he was behind the resignation of the Commission with referee Luďěk Macela was at the Dagmar Damková.
Paclík claimed, he felt the role of the chairman of the association.
And holding up his skills in the management of private firms, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, celebrated with his support in May celebrated the first triumph in the League.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to the cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which turn up in horrific situations ," Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy for example, to the Sparta boss Daniel Křetínský.
As one of its priorities, the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose help he would evoke the political leaders to ensure that more money from the lottery tax in the sport.
"This is one of the key things that should be addressed by the new chairman."
"When it comes to the taxation of luck games, such as the political parties, then I understand their reasoning, they must also be clear where the money goes," he said.
Its link to the Pilsner club does not Paclík also as a handicap, although he emphasized, the chairman of the FAČR "bipartisan ."
Pelta, in turn, is associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"This is not ideal."
"It is not my opinion but also a lot of sense to transfer my shares in the club Pilsner hypocritical to a third person to return after a year and a half years," said Paclík clear.
Pelta promised new statutes of FAČR, the ausschlössen a stalemate in the future.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association promised one of the candidates for the post of chairman, Miroslav Pelta, if elected, he will ensure that the FAČR gets new statutes in future disputes over the electoral law.
The official from Jablonec before the Thursday hearing in Nymburk confident and believes that the campaign would defuse a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta promised not carried out before the election in September that he wants to do in the event of his election to the national team and the collection of funds.
He decided at the last moment, to participate in the election before the last General Assembly, and so did help him the two-month pause to defend his ideas on the running of football and in a broader context.
"People at all levels is devoted to football, they are impatient and therefore expect that the chairman on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the Association is led by someone, says the man who is particularly associated with the Jablonecer club, but also many years in Sparta and the executive committee.
This is also why he says that he does not have sufficient experience to guide the Czech football.
He is convinced that is responsible for the current problems with the election of the euphoria that existed at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, in the General Assembly in June approved statutes that were not perfect, as had all accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have already had a chairman, "said Pelta in September.
The review of the most important document of the citizens association he used as bait for the delegates.
"I should be president, I take myself personally, and I am willing to take personal responsibility, if it does not."
"This is a matter of principle, without which it cannot be," said Pelta.
In addition, he is not trying to differentiate themselves to his opponent.
He had earlier announced that he could cooperate with Jindřich Rajchl imagine recognizes the because of his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent in his first deputy.
Also Tomáš Paclík, he has been for a long time, which in turn, no dry thread Pelta.
In football, he is more than a year and can already point to some successes. "
"The attacks were herabsetzend and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"So many doubts about his true nature," Pelta addressed his opponent, who will probably be his proclamations to which he expressed in September.
In his view, is his strongest weapon knowledge of football from the lowest divisions, to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
"I would try to put an end to all Affairen - the issue Bohemians, to the halls of the corruption scandal last year."
"Immediately afterwards I would lead to negotiations with the private and public sector to ensure sufficient funding for the whole of football," said the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate ČTK two months ago.
At the time, he promised that will mean his arrival at the tip of the Czech football staff cleansing.
"I would like to start with the job content of all employees," he said in the direction Strahov, where is due to the length of anarchy understandably nervous.
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios that accompany the forthcoming General Assembly, he believes that the delegates on Thursday after Nymburk in vain.
"If that is really the only point of contention, as you choose in the third round, then we come."
"Football needs credibility and he is the only way back when he finally has a new leader" remains Pelta two days before the potentially decisive day of his official career optimistic.
Rajchl promises that the work of FAČR below him hard begins
If the current deputy leader Jindřich Rajchl at the General Assembly on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, would supposedly frenzy that many people in the club's whim.
Rajchl promises that in the case of his election promises to work hard.
He wants to introduce changes and the members of the Executive Committee for individual football fields.
He also promised to resolve the case Bohemians to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA to bring more money into the football and continue the work of the previous presiding Ivan Hašek has begun.
"As chairman, I would like to turn to the football as a whole."
From the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, the national selection, the professional football, to the football for the youth. "
"I am not saying that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in the conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and would distribute the competences of the executive committee that deals with each member pays a certain area."
And I will be distributing hard tasks, so that the football in each segment with. "
Moreover, many not just delighted because, instead of only to criticise the work of others, now itself should begin to work really hard, "he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement have considered no longer to run.
"I know that I am working 20 hours a day."
"But I must know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me, not me constantly spanners in the works, and every step I am in question," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"Many people have told me that I should not give up, because it would otherwise do others."
"It is trust must not squander it," he said.
Allegedly motivated him to continue the work that he has begun under Hašek.
"In two years we have accomplished a great deal of work and I do not want to throw away now."
"Processes have been launched, the only in a few years to come, and I would hate to see that they ride," he said, and hereby expresses its concern that in the event that the other candidate - would be elected Miroslav Pelta, could return the situation in the days before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic approach and this is something that Mirek Pelta not."
"Behind him, above all, people who would make the football so that he would be only for exclusivity."
I can be some, but not that I would be biased. "
"I am trying to be objective."
"I don't want football for all, because it is all very well, and not just a selected," said Rajchl.
He also rejects the claim that he was a leader of the Czechs.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I really have to do what is best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the League should not be grouped in a Czech and Moravian part, the winners in each of the first League visited."
"It could not happen today only three Moravian clubs in the league, particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem," said Rajchl.
Because now the head of the Pilsner clubs Tomáš Paclík the battle for the post of chairman, dares not Rajchl to assess his chances that he will be elected.
"I feel a strong support in the chamber, which has been elected to its deputy chairman and now recognises that clear successes stand behind me," led Rajchl, saving tens of millions of kronor for disadvantageous contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand, it is partly to blame for the fact that the association is not a single hymn sheet.
While Pelta he says, "he was disqualified from the outset, the Czech football with greater confidence, he believes that the second rivals - Paclík for a strong candidate to the football really does have something to offer."
"No one can question that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year."
"Should he be elected, he would probably continue with things that Ivan Hašek has initiated and the personnel in the commissions he would obviously not change."
He would certainly not things in its favour altered want "judgements Rajchl on his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Leap in the dark
Julie Stanek
Plantschbecken in Ufo optics, "pools in Budapest: anyone who travels through Europe can be nasty shock - rest and after a Tour cities or relax the tired legs in Sprudelbädern.
A book that shows where wellness in the water in the most beautiful.
If iris Meder in the past year and a half years on research trip, was not one in your luggage: her bathing suit.
Rücklings water, it is high in artfully shaped cupolas, they swam marble Putten, they waited on the side of the basin, and was amazed about meticulously restored from Jugendstilschwimmhallen.
Did her a bath, they, in their note book - including wissenswerten details about the design and history of the building.
More than 200 pools various fact-finding architecture historian Meder in this way - and it is now in her book "bathing ": popular swimming halls in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest," hard-core concrete buildings "in the region.
By 13 countries, their "trip to the most extraordinary dipping in Central Europe: Germany, Austria and Switzerland, they visited sites in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a real bathing culture Enthusiastin.
With sport do not have much everybody says Meder - only in the water is different.
Annoying only swimming fans with blue Kacheln and chlorine smell, while jogger can listen to the betörenden smell of Fichtenwäldern inhale or happy in the mornings in the park.
"One day I asked why must be swimming pools are always so ugly," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I started to collect beautiful baths."
Water surface doubled architecture
Geplätscher jump in the pool and sauna essential oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so great, because it all sense, Meder.
And if the builders, can be a real Augenschmaus swimming halls: "Instead of a soil has a water surface bathrooms."
"It is clear, on the one hand, reflects on the other hand, but the beauty of the whole building."
All doubled it looks: high vaults, colorful Kacheln leap out.
The kleinformatige picture band "bathing pleasures" is 190 pages of value of knowledge about architecture and cultural history historic wellness oases - but above all an appetite for a leap in the dark.
Remarkable specimens discovered the pool Sammlerin Meder with her research in Hungary.
Alongside magnificent salvation dipping such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest was a nitrathaltiges waters in an urigen Karsthöhle (caves in Miskolc Tapolca), as well as a spa bath, whose basin filled with alkalihaltigem water and are in a flaschenförmigen buildings (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular prospects, on the other hand, many free unoccupied Spa in Switzerland and Austria: During the Zurich roof of the entire city, you can look in the external pool of Bads in the Bads in St Anton along paths Arlberg - and: steam bath, there is a window that can be seen on the activities of the ski runway.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design expected bathers in length field: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a particularly in the Alps gelandetes Ufo.
Three open-ended bowls dampft in the winter, while those in the background, the mountains of Ötztals stand in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not every swimming pool, the pool Sammlerin Meder the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal spas smelt of sulphur in Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so strong after fuel oil, which is difficult to believe that to be landed in a bad health.
The smell comes from the alkali hydrogenkarbonathaltigen water, it is almost black and of silt a skin once you slip into the pool - a wellness experience the special.
In one place was disappointed iris Meder in their search for beautiful bathing sites but also: When they wanted to visit the free and sun in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, it was an abgesperrtes terrain.
In 1902 by the architect dušan Jurkovic was now closed.
As Meder a glance through the window verwitterten yellow, red and white youth style building, they looked like weeds between the tiles.
The decline has countered, however, in a boy from swimming in the Black Forest: the Palais thermal bath wild bath.
Three construction schedules, this was already behind him, can detect not only neoromanische elements from the time of its establishment in 1844, but also a maurische hall in Alhambra style, which was added in 1900.
Since the 1995 thorough modernisation is the Palais spa's favourite swimming pool of knowledgeable iris Meder - and not only because they originated from the Black Forest.
"It is quite an achievement, various Baustile to such a great unity," says Meder.
In such a palace is the Tauchgang in the thermal pool appear to be beside the point.
Agricultural speculation
German bank leaves commodity business,
By Christian Teevs
The Deutsche Bank business with agricultural commodities?
After SPIEGEL ONLINE information Josef Ackermann has a working group to examine the impact of speculation on the world's poor.
In January, the company head then draw conclusions.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable, according to a study that speculating banks with agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.
Two thirds of respondents calling that Deutsche Bank and other lenders go out of business, because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa poll commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented to the Food Watch in mid-October.
It shows the author Harald Schumann, betting that the global commodity exchanges drive up prices - and the banks therefore complicit in the world hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protector is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, even if big banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Commodity bets were initially intended to traders to hedge against price volatility.
But in the meantime, most experts agree that the gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand - and profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the U.S. competitors Ackermann responded to the criticism, he promised to look into the allegations and said that no business is worth it "to put the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE an International Working Group is currently considering the allegations from the Food Watch Report.
By the end of the year is expected to be completed, then the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank, with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January to share the top of the bank, what consequences it entails.
In the end could be a reduction of the commodity business, or even a complete departure.
Ackermann fusses over his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but also reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "the betting on rising food prices is particularly severe damage as reckless banks today the common good."
Ackermann stand as top banking lobbyist now particular duty.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all installations from its portfolio, where money is being used for betting on food prices," said Bode.
"Regardless of whether Mr Ackermann people suffering hunger or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann at first sight surprising, but it is clear that the head of the company a few months before his departure from office a perfect picture.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO differently than planned no change in the supervisory board.
With a move away from the controversial agricultural speculation he could improve his image.
And possible reductions needs to do it - that would have to do, after all, his successor.
Every second commodity assets would terminate
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users took part in the campaign of the organisation.
Bode the poll published on Tuesday, for which the Institute Forsa on 7 and 8 November 1001 people questioned.
Just eleven percent believe that it is legitimate that Deutsche Bank facilities offering involving bets on prices for food.
Many bank customers would also personal consequences when they learn that their bank involved in such transactions: Every second according to the survey would terminate all facilities where money goes into the commodity speculation.
43% would advise friends of such a bank, 49% said to reflect, to cancel their accounts and to switch to another institution.
21 s house in Vienna
The umgezogene pavilion
By Mrs Wiensowski
An architectural history with ups and downs and happy ending: the Austrian World Expo pavilion was 1958, prices of Brussels in Vienna to the museum, was empty and descended.
Now he will be considered issuing house reopened.
If modern architecture, dreams of clear, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials, which are typical of the faith to technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Expo 1958 a striking and well-known example.
Schwanzers pavilion at the time the Grand Prix d Architecture for his easy, steel and glass construction.
The construction has, to date as a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He also made the architects so well known that the Austria at the next World Expo pavilion built.
With his legendary BMW Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem subsidiary building in Munich in 1973, he became internationally famous.
The planned construction of a temporary exhibition pavilion set up after the world exhibition at the Swiss garden in Vienna South station, rebuilt and opened 1962 is a museum of the 20th century opened - the "20 s house" it was called. "
It was the buildings but not physically and technically as a museum - no walls on the slopes of art, not a good climate.
Nevertheless, it has been used for so long, the contemporary art in Vienna a new house.
Since 2001 the building was empty and came more and more.
Now has converted the architect Adolf Krischanitz the pavilion, he is now "21 s House" and is used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening opened the museum Belvedere, one of the House, where the first exhibition - a fortune in every respect.
Through the restart Agnes Husslein Arco, the 2007 new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein Arco, solicitor art historian with considerable career including the youth than Eiskunstläufererin later Sotheby's, the Guggenheim museum and as a founding director of the museum of Modern Salzburg, the restructuring strongly among politicians and the monument conservationists, they acquired public funds and private sponsorship funds and put the use.
No contemporary art should be issued the works of Bildhauers Fritz Wotruba by the eponymous foundation, a cafe and a bookshop, and there should be an office House had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the implementation was then Krischanitz the ideal occupation.
Not only because he rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna sensitive and won the competition, but because he has studied in Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him a "tremendously important" was the place where he "almost every weekend" had seen the exhibitions.
He knew the Ur draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which was already in his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung of generosity and easily lost.
In the current reconstruction there was far greater problems: the building was an Energieschleuder, "says Krischanitz."
The profiles of the glass facade windows have been replaced, glasfaserverstärktes insulating glass and the glass roof replaced by special security glass.
Kältebrücken steel sources have been replaced or replaced, and asbestgefüllte blankets were rescued.
Two shells made room for the new use, an abgesenkter light gap between house and road provides the Belichtung, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a building, but still the easy Schwanzer pavilion.
The original external doors have remained, the house is deleted in the old rotbraunen rust-protection color tone.
And the cinema is even more exactly as it was before.
The memorial authority and all this under strict supervision and with a small budget.
"Often had to be found a material that is good and cheap, and also the monument protection office did," says Krischanitz and points to an abrasive soil in the underground missile.
Despite all the constraints, problems and building the building remained flexible and easy.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical "dropout in the City history."
So an architecture "always in the wrong place" and wants to "create a real awareness."
In this case, the 21 s house but not in the wrong place, because it is an urban stroke occurred: the Swiss garden just completely new planned "Central Station, office and residential accommodation."
And another stroke will happen: the 21 s house could increase by another Krischanitz construction, because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin fizzled art hall, and we hear, they have been negotiating with the city a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden.
Rail plans winter crisis package in millions
The railway has mapped out a contingency plan to prevent the Zugausfälle in the winter.
The number of staff should be doubled.
It will cost millions.
In the fight against winterbedingte Zugausfälle and delays are Deutsche Bahn, according to a newspaper report this year on an additional EUR 70 million.
The "picture" newspaper reported, citing an inter-group contingency plan in advance, are investing a total of around EUR 300 million by 2015.
It should be better availability of vehicles and rail network in extreme Witterungen.
It is planned, among other things, a doubling of the internal and external staff for snow removal in railway stations and rail hike to 16,000 persons.
Goal is widths until the beginning of the operation and 90 percent of betriebsnotwendigen choices within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, rail chief Rudiger pit after a top-level meeting with government and industry to cancellations and delays in this winter.
Last winter, the rail passenger transport problems, because it lacks including difficult weather conditions.
So many new regional trains for years waiting for authorization from the Federal railway Administration.
There is also a delay in the extradition of ICE trains.
The railway also makes for years that they clearly axes of ICE trains significantly more frequently in the garage must, after an ICE in Cologne Station an axes.
German bank pays millions of punishment in the United States
After the turmoil surrounding chief Josef Ackermann is new hardships for the US: Deutsche Bank must pay a million repentance there.
As if the problems at home for the Deutsche Bank would not be enough, now, his past is catching the industry giants in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays in a $145 million (EUR 106 million) to settle disputes over the collapse of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial market regulators NCUA raises a number of big banks, cooperative banks led to buy financial products with false promises; they have downplayed the risks.
Such papers lost during the financial crisis sharply in value and tore the banks with in depth.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without having to move the parties in court," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank admitted no fault with the comparison.
The same applies to the Citigroup, which undertook to pay $20.5 million.
The NCUA chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the willingness of the two finance houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and is in bankruptcy in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA tried, which caused billions in damage.
The comparisons are now closed the first of its kind.
The regulator had other big banks, and in the summer WaMu sued Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage backed securities.
This is based on home loans.
As the housing bubble burst in 2007, this was a wide range of financial firms are doomed.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, swung the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers.
Even if the events a few years ago, when the banks are currently in the United States a sharp wind.
Investors and regulators have mounted numerous appeals, in order to obtain compensation or to punish wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave action.
It raises 18 major international banks, the two state housing financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage transactions to the tune of around $200 billion dollars.
The Deutsche Bank faces a charge of FHFA, there is a business worth a total of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority that the Frankfurt for "substantial losses ," but without a precise figure.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the demands as unfounded, they want to.
Warren Buffett increases with 10 billion in IBM
Finanzguru Buffett invested heavily in IT companies IBM.
Since March he has bought shares with a value of more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett always said, not to invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of the firms only bad forecast.
Now, however, he read the reports of IBM and changed his mind about investment in the sector.
He must understand much earlier that IBM mainly services and implied beschaffe computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment from Warren Buffett is a knight blow in the financial world.
Consequently, the it cornerstone IBM now call "Sir IBM."
Because Buffett revealed now in the U.S. economic CNBC broadcaster that he bought since March IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway is one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that did not even IBM knew something of the commitment.
He praised the management, even in the economic crisis had ensured decent profits.
"They have done an excellent job," said Buffett's strategy.
IBM, for a long time on the lucrative IT Services as the operation of data centres.
More than 100 years old computer pioneer also offers software and advice to companies and powerful computers.
Buffett had hitherto shunned technology firms.
He says he only invest in companies whose business he also understand.
Instead, Buffett as a freight railway, a lubricant manufacturer or mechanical engineers.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway alongside around 80 own subsidiaries also shares in a number of large companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich former Munich Re, the reinsurance.
Of the 81 -year-olds had taken over in the 1960 s, the small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway and strengthened with wise investment to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
It is a cult figure for many investors in the world.
Almost unmistakable sense for earning him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha ."
After the Buffett investment, the IBM stock vorbörslich rose by one percent.
"Big Blue ," as IBM is known, is worth more than $220 billion in the stock market, and, therefore, together with Apple and Microsoft is one of the most valuable technology company in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he would not enter.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is real
After the discovery of the "doubt Turkish media on German Zwickauer cell," the rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology, which auflebe now.
The murders of eight türkischstämmigen and a Greek small entrepreneurs in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extreme right-wing background.
This news will in Turkey and within the deutschtürkischen population in Germany with fear and anxiety.
Because for many German türken is a long totgeglaubtes specter: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 there has been no comparable violence with more extreme right-wing background against Turks.
In Germany, xenophobia, but never in question.
The recent right-wing extremist network shows, however, is not yet in sight.
"The bloody ideology again?" the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper ran the headline "Haber Turk."
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, "stresses that one of the perpetrators may have been a V man of constitutional protection, and expresses concern that German authorities might be involved in the extreme right-wing swamp.
Calmly responded to the Turkish community in Germany: you reminded at the weekend with a Mahnwache in front of the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks earlier had thought the Turkish community in Berlin with German and Turkish politicians in a celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Franco-German Turkish Anwerbeabkommens.
In cheery colours was staged peaceful coexistence - as a history of success.
As a slap in the face of the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the Fifty," reads the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "X ," which cites the background of the series of murders.
The German edition of "Hürriyet" does not to consider these ideas.
"It starts to stink," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people have been murdered, paid taxes and would have done with their work made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
Highly critical of the actions of the police deutschtürkischen Internet forums, and their search later success.
Why the German authorities have not learned much more to search for suspects in right-wing circles, surprised the authors.
Some shows, at least rhetorically drastic measures: "there is a sloppy approach, there is nothing left for migrants as self-defence and arming."
"This will probably be the best form of protection."
"The quality of education and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much domestic peace in Germany," writes "selenium."
What it means when the inner peace in Germany is in danger, clarified the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the nineties.
The photo of the burning ruins of Solingen is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish.
Because no other event, the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that can lead to mistrust and distance in right-wing violence.
The attacks ahead but we sense on the Turkish side.
The not repeat past mistakes
In the Turkish press was criticised at the time, above all, the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish president, at the funeral in Cologne but represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Kinkel was then in his speech on how many charges here Turks.
As berechne the value of people at the height of his tax charges.
The current reporting of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the domestic rule since then.
In addition to the efforts of a wide-ranging investigation and reassessment of the right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany needs this time open words.
The scandal Bank of Zürisee
The abenteuerlichste bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS in the financial crisis almost bankrupt, and since then has stumbled from one crisis to the next.
Now it is going to be a German.
It was certainly not intended Axel Weber.
After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank was revealed in July announced that he would make 2013 an almost equally spectacular new job: Board President of the big Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was publicly praised Switzerland whether their beauty and UBS whether their newfound solidity and kept warm comments about the future.
"The UBS has managed the Turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September it was clear that everything would be quite different.
A trader at UBS in London had evaded all security systems of the bank and found some 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Chief Executive Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland's vaunted bankers had to leave.
The President of the Board of UBS, also damaged - and all ask: when will finally Axel Weber?
The bank was already known that Weber from February 2012 to discuss.
And the administrative presidency assumes he already in May - not only in 2013, as the bank on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber will be hard.
It is not a banker, an economics professor and central bankers, and would have had an apprenticeship period certainly needed.
At a stroke, he then assumes the responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just shown once again that they have long been deserves the title "biggest scandal bank in Europe ."
Because the UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset managers in the world - and, on the other hand, has been reeling for years by a scandal in the next.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the secretive and solid, but also ausgebufften Swiss wealth manager had combined with ambitious goals: they wanted to be in the investment banking is a very large number.
On the one hand, the UBS 2007 managed to high-net-worth customers with $1.6 trillion more money than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it was as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks late.
This made impression.
The former banker and subsequent longtime banking analyst Hans Geiger counter in Zurich: "Do student I have portrayed the UBS was regarded as a model of good bank."
"From today's point of view, one wonders: How did I do wrong?"
He was wrong.
In 2007, for the first time that something was wrong came in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Peter Wuffli surprising hochintellektueller in the meantime, as well as ingenuous bankers.
A few months later, suspecting he was gone.
The investment bank had been with subprime securities and had to write off billions.
In order to cope with the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
So it was in fact investors, but what about some until shortly before the face: a non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds, which was so quiet that they did not even have heard his name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, there was worse.
The bank had to be new billion losses, Board President Marcel Ospel, 2006, the second-best paid Board Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008 was followed by the disaster: UBS was given its bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state.
The National bank bought the UBS for tens of billions of troubled securities, the Swiss Confederation was six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, on which they could be Miteigentümerin the bank.
The whole country was shocked, because they said, as dramatic as it is for a small country, if it is so large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet of the UBS 2007 more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"Once again we could not save UBS ', says banks researchers Geiger counter.
The first disaster joined the second.
A few months later surrendered the UBS tax dispute with America, agreeing to publish the data high-net-worth clients who had evaded taxes, perhaps with the help of the bank.
They also agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from this business and criminal charge.
Thus, the UBS more or less open to help in tax evasion.
At the same time she lost something that has always been their capital was in competition for wealthy clients: the aura of secrecy.
After the scandal was not Swiss banking secrecy.
It followed the resignation of CEO and Board President.
And the exodus of customers" money.
It had lost the bank within months its credibility in two main business areas: in the investment banking through the false speculation and asset management assistance for tax evasion.
And, just as it has been somewhat calmer, just as it was thought that now will get the UBS it again, because this is An unfortunate traders history: An individual traders found EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank notes that something was wrong.
And it appears to be: the risk management in the investment banking is obviously still did not work.
"With the case Adoboli has found that the risk control too little has changed," says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial management of a large German bank is sure the UBS: "the problem is that it has no risk control."
Was it just the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers for a long time ago, guardian of the major assets of the world: no great risks for safety for money - but also collapse across the Alpine republic in the world.
The Tresore Swiss banks have become the symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich fits the stereotype of the upright Swiss private bank - it is only a little bit bigger.
The situation is classic.
The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich station road that leads from the main train station in Zurich directly on the sea, flanked by the summits of the Swiss mountains along paths.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers as Tiffany's here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, the Swiss banks: by the National Bank of the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius bear.
The reception hall of the UBS boards through a revolving door.
Inside, the walls marmorverkleidet verge thick leather armchairs, alongside the bank logo is a great sign for the "safe ."
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of Swiss bank have both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but eventually betrayed - or, as the head of a small Swiss private bank.
His name he would rather not read in the newspaper, he, like all Swiss bankers, even with the two big banks.
The UBS had become too big, he finds - particularly in investment banking, where would spread the Anglo-Saxons.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And if they have long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, UBS, its only high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the sub-prime jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008 was a disaster.
"On that Wednesday, the coalition of small Siebenmillionenlandes the biggest bailout in the history of their nation," writes the author Luke Hässig in his book "the UBS crash."
Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion approved politicians, in order to save the large bank for the from bankruptcy.
How did it happen?
Talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem, especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks a huge corporation.
It was a bank that the merger was too big for the small Switzerland - and grew still further.
It helped that supplemented the two different precursor banks UBS: a rich, but verschlafene bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but even more internationalized.
Suddenly the internationalised investment bankers favourable to a lot of money with which they could a huge wheel.
Two names are linked to the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, the head of UBS, Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team," says banks researchers Hans Geiger counter.
"Wuffli, higher intellectuals, Bescheidene who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the man who has heraufgearbeitet from the bank lesson to the top."
But Ospel have to rely on Wuffli finish.
And Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger counter.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: embolden came in the case.
The leaders of UBS clearly remember the meetings at which company chief Wuffli purported to be the same slogan: Dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They led the "League Tables" rankings, which documented the success of the banks of the time.
Then the UBS, according to the top.
Some steps were their success.
In the foreign exchange and stock trade, she played at the top.
Business advisers who have been charged, but stressed a weakness: in the international interest in the business, bankers "fixed-income," there is a huge gap among the world's largest banks.
The UBS have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS in an adventure that almost cost the existence.
Hungry for growth, the bank invested both themselves and their seats of hedge funds in American subprime assets.
They became a huge machine that securities on American mortgage loans packaged and passed - but also risks.
Also, as other banks for an exit.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. housing market in flames, has bought the UBS there," says banking expert Geiger counter.
The euphoria so great, so deeply.
A manager after another had to go to clean up the attempts were more difficult than expected.
Items in the UBS were to be used as a weapon and are still shaky.
Whoever leads the large bank now has an almost impossible job.

On a personal level, mass slaughter
Sensitive and generous begins Peter Englunds new book "beauty and horror: a story of the First World War, told in nineteen fates" with a long list of main persons to heart.
A tip on how to proceed: Cut off the side of caution and make it your reading.
They will get to know these people in Englunds romanhafter narrative very well, and these players will as your GPS function as a beacon in these few moments where you lose as Englunds men and women in the fog of war and are deprived of their illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for literature.
He has written an unusual book, not incorrect describes as "a work of history ."
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles, there is little ambassadors, racing reporter or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he says, but rather "a book about how it was." it is about "feelings and impressions, experiences and feelings."
"Beauty and horror" almost the wartime experiences of 20 more or less discreet men and women on both sides of the war, ranging from school girls and Botanikern to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people are heroes.
Some will lose to prisoners of war, limb, crazy or die.
Each of these lives faint as the Votivkerzen in a church, some, while others fade away.
Englunds book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrected the idea that the First World war was just devastating position war on the Western front.
"Beauty and horror" with experts on other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the Ostfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are bees baskets, a celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a very moving book almost from the outset.
The lives of these people flooded the war as a natural disaster like hurricane Katrina, which reeks of Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with their children, and cannon fire in the distance, you stay or you take the flight?
Who is at all?
Hardly anyone understands what happened or why this war at all.
"The lack of facts ," Englund," with assumptions assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours. "
"Beauty and horror" individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard root, a young German ship sailors.
Their stories were mainly memories from letters and other documents already material.
Their reports can be frightening or simply of life, but they are very vivid in Englunds loses in details accumulation of small moments.
Many of them lack and butt Behelfen act.
In the story of a German school girl told him: "replacement, everywhere."
"Ersatzkaffee, wrong aluminium, false eraser, paper, wood buttons."
He tells more of the spare Essen in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and Hammelfett was cooked (and most recently with a false bone from wood), tobacco, which was made from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes with wooden besohlt."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered food spare funds that were allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitute."
Some stories act of honor and bravery.
An American acknowledges his own drive to the ferocity and says of the war: "It feels that despite what was envisaged for men rather than to sit in the Lehnstuhl, with the evening tide or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in my hand, and to pretend that such a veneer of civilisation and there are no barbarism behind their own strengthened and keeper shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier, that he would probably die, and no one will notice or care.
"If one of the idea to sacrifice themselves, you would think that this is happening in front of a crowd," he writes.
Instead, it is quite as horrible as "a convicted man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations from the old Europe falling apart, and on new types of terrorism.
"The conflict was becoming an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He starts the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the Bestiarium of the young century ": the word" looking and ideologically committed mass murderers in made-to-measure, slaughtering them, while he sits behind a desk. "
People behave in unexpected ways and there are equally frivoles behaviour as civic-mindedness.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to becoming infected with a sexually transmitted disease with a prostitute in order to escape the front line service.
"The grotesque, which can be found in the trade with Gonokokken Eiter, because soldiers and grease on their genitals, hoping to come to the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate, rieben him in the eye, which meant that they were the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves will Englunds poetry elastic but intrusiveness and fits perfectly in his human task.
In dozens of small scenes he the way, "as the war unleashed on unique way uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People start to wonder why their leaders to the fighting.
The best books about the First World War were usually more distorted as Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarques "nothing new" in the West as a comprehensive history books.
Englunds band is an unconventional glorious hall.
His book has the most devastating end, which I have ever read in a physical book.
I am not there any more.
But it is as if he snapped up with his book this side of the main people in their faces and lit with a match.
After an early misstep a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wore use helmets.
They had opted for the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time, few people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few senior officials were informed. All other initially believed to be part of an exercise.
Police President Raymond w. Kelly was in the midst of them, and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The events of the last few weeks as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the Dezernats and Hausbesetzern a huge increase in public sympathies, could not be repeated.
And so the police operation for the removal of protesters from Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared by they watched, were handled occupations in other cities.
A Katastrophenübung had taken place with a view to Zuccotti in peripheral space.

The last training unit did Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to collect in the park, "at the last minute," said someone familiar with the command is, what a description than "exercise ."
"The few police officers who were involved to my knowledge, not knowing that it came down to Zuccotti Park," said someone who wishes to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew that it went to the Zuccotti Park, the senior officials of the portfolio."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned the city.
On 14 October, officials wanted to remove the park differed but then back came as hundreds of protest learning together, after they had learned from these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the operation on Tuesday, including force from all over the city - riot gear mobile officials who are normally used in high crime neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said that many people in the park during the day and, almost as commuters, 1 o'clock at night is a good time to go into.
"It was appropriate to do so, if the smallest number of people in the park," he said.
Ambulances with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were prior to the departure of the Pike panties and the Franklin d. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the first recorded messages dröhnten from the loudspeakers dröhnten seemed to intimidate protesters.
As public officials in their bright blue wind jackets broke into the park, rafften many protesters simply their belongings and left the ground.
The police said that until 1:45 pm no tents would be tackled in order to give the protest learning time to pack their homes and possessions.
Other teams of officers were seen as they gathered in the area to try to intervene should be necessary arrests in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul j. Browne, a spokesman for the police Minister, said that this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists say that they wanted to prevent the police actions in the park, and they said, the way in which the officials was very harsh.
Mr Browne said that television trucks in the Church Street on the west side of the park photos could have made.
When the police in the West through the mess of personal matters, the protesters, including suitcases, plastic lawn and bags with clothes, was followed by their city employees cleaning removed what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go to the outside world were towed, pictures appeared just a short time later on the Internet.
A main core of protest learning was in the vicinity of the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park position.
Some erected barriers and police continued their methodological arrests.
Approximately 10 people at the epicenter of the camp did in her arms.
And two people would chain themselves to trees, said Mr Kelly.
Civil protection officials were called to loszuschneiden them.

The evacuation was completed according to the police after 75 minutes.
Mr Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
To most of the arrests occurred, he said, because "disorderly conduct and resisting arrest."
The most prominent local officials was Joseph j. Esposito, the head of the department, the top uniformed officers of the department.
Phil t. Pula ski, departmental Chief of Detectives, was also there.
Despite his presence ', "Mr Kelly" operation ," as Mr Browne said.
In the event that they should have waited a second group of officials on the eastern side of the Broad, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In the Cortlandt Street, a road block north of the park, and in the Pine Street, one block farther south, barricades were set up.
It could be observed, as these sites from the police the area around Zuccotti Park.
In one place has been observed, as several officials, many of them with protection signs, drove people out.
Approximately 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 p. m., south of the Pine Street protesters jumped on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air from the tyres of a police bus.
In one place, the volume a bit Sperrholz.

Trade union for carers because of a complaint against the city
The union, the hundreds of workers who have lost their jobs last month, is planning to sue the city on Wednesday, as the redundancies on the grounds of undue influence on the schools, the poor students, are not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is probably the last chance that the union, District Council 37, in their efforts to make redundancies, is still open.
Sechshundertzweiundsiebzig school helpers, care coordinators and other staff, who are among the lowest paid employees of the city and on 7 October in a move had lost their jobs, union leaders have described as political revenge for that last year the city's access to a health fund, which had the working groups, had refused to close the budget gap.
These allegations were rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis m. Walcott, director of the schools, last month that the redundancies were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the council leapt back and explained to him that nothing in the budget spezifiziere that the school aid workers would be laid off.
Officials of the City council in 37 said that they have warned the Ministry of Education in a lawsuit on Wednesday there will be a press conference to announce the date the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan formally announced.
The complaint, mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as a defendant and count eight laid-off workers as plaintiffs, all coloured or Latin American women, like most of the workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice, said that the city would not be the case, and therefore could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a lawsuit, which is of the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of redundancies in schools in poor neighbourhoods of the city to support a complaint alleging discrimination, claiming that had lost poor schools more workers, because they are chronically underfunded.
It states that, while there are no redundancies at Staten Island and few redundancies in schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aides in District 23 in Brown's Ville, Brooklyn, and have been laid off 46 workers in the districts 8 and 9 in the South raspberry.
With the loss of five of eight 36 school personnel in the public school in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, were employed, the complaint says, "This is not a neighborhood worried-but-wealthy parents who can organise the donations to offset budget cuts."
P. s.: the budget of the 36 Javan was reduced this year by 3.26%. In addition, funds have been lost, as the city changed its method of calculating the extra funding for any Armenschuleneinschreibung.
The union also complained that the head of the high schools with the language in a memo, which authorized the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the act, even if "excess': transfer) in the United States usually the exchange of teachers on the payroll of a school in a pool of available workers who are paid by the central office.
"Sixty six care coordinators, not handed over," says the complaint.
Mission ended, Congress prepared to agree on Libya
Ultimately, it seems as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington, on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed in this regard, the success of the revolt, the arrest and killing of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and ending the American interference.
On Thursday the committee on international relations of the Senate, a resolution, which Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph i. Lieberman (Connecticut), which Libya for the successful rebellion and the American troops for their "courage" praises.
"This resolution is a tribute to the courageous people of Libya who have started to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"It is an affirmation of their democratic support efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, legislators of both parties and the White House on the wording of a series of resolutions on the approval or disapproval of the U.S. military role in NATO's Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain a resolution that authorized the use of military force in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad fringe of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this bill in the Senate and the chamber also overruling a decision to cut money for American operations in Libya.
It was the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with a Congress that it was enough to criticize Obama's approach in the context of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the rug out from underneath him.
It was the indecisiveness of Congress overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell in August by the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be willing to take action.
The resolution of the International Relations Committee congratulates the people of Libya to their enormous courage and exceptional perseverance in their own liberation "and" praises the men and women of the U.S. military and its coalition partners who support the military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their exceptional courage and professionalism. "
The resolution also reaffirmed "the national interests of the United States to a successful and irrevocable Libya's transition to democracy."
The new measures will receive the full support of the body for foreign relations or to divide the legislator, as it has done the law in June?
The final version of the resistance of the Senator Richard g. Lugar (Indiana polis), the top Republican of the committee.
Lugars spokesman said on Monday that he had not seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol Hill, the onus is on the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment, which calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional term the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob Good bar (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or other area at the time to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have tried, unsuccessfully, to bring their amendments to the vote, although they tried often enough.
Goodlattes change is only one of 68 constitutional amendments that were presented to the Congress and include a range of issues.
Some are twice - the same law was presented to both Congress and the Senate - others differ only slightly.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance in the Senate and another dozen would control federal spending ." "
Some of the laws are identical, but they give their customers - particularly first-year Republicans who want to burnish their CV - about the possibility that such a measure "written ."
The Haushaltskontrollgesetz, which was adopted in August, requires that both the Senate and Congress vote on an amendment to balancing the budget.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution, which supports the idea of such a change.
On the budget, some members want the number of provisions that can present the members of Congress to limit, while the Republicans José e. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit of two terms of office of the president.
The Republican Jesse l. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments which guarantee the right to a good education and health care.
An amendment that prohibits marriage under Gleichgeschlechtlichen, as well as an amendment that prohibits the burning of flags, a recurring.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws, a rejection of two-thirds of the states.
So, as proposed by the changes, so they move even faster than in the past few years.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers 77 such changes, changes in the 110th Congress in 66.
The pace pales in comparison with that of the early 1990 s, in which members regularly every two years, more than 150 changes proposed, the figures, which the Senate library.
But they were not much more successful than today's.
Add the last amendment, which is - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact already proposed 1789 Congress.
"But not defeated," Giffords taken in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man in the near distance during an election rally in Tucson, they had entered Republikanerin Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) sang on national television Monday night, only to the Broad piece "the Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover, is larger than the returning to Congress.
As they, along with Diane Sawyer in the ABC News "20/20" appeared, they struggled for words and needed assistance in walking.
The broadcast showed severe slow recovery from the damage that the bullet, shared her skull, durchbohrt the left side of her brain and has crossed their heads from start to finish, has done.
Three months ago returned it surprising in the Congress to triumphantly cast their votes on debt brake.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, smiling Gifford, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult ."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, replied Gifford (41): "well."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an one-hour "20/20" Specials, on the eve of the publication of the new book by the couple recorded: "Gabby: a story about courage and hope."
The Special followed Giffords recovery since the attack on 8 January.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you see them in the hospital bed, with kahl rasiertem head and a long scarf on their foreheads.
They can raise only one or two fingers, if encouraged her husband.
Months later, Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair, while therapists to show how they simple movements.
A nod of the head.
A twitch of the lips.
And then, her first words: "What."
After a few days whispering Giffords another word: "toast." they want to see changed.
Videos, which will take place in the ABC show, show that music played an important role in Giffords" recovery: see how the members of Congress, together with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Pettys "Free Fallin" ."
In the interview with Sawyer said Giffords who spends two hours a day with therapy that they do not remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that he Giffords on 12 March had read an article in a newspaper on the attack when they stopped him and asked for the first time in the six people who were killed during the attack.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and forcibly treated medically, while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
In the course of the recovery of his wife, Kelly told Sawyer that she said: "I was taken."
"Therefore, I would say:" Gabby, you got to be unbeaten? ," "said Kelly.
You got to be taken.
And you will get through this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala, collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a Ballad of helplessness, frustration and loss.
On cue, collected hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines around him.
The crowd in black Smokings stood up and applauded.
"The servicemen and women were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organised the fundraising effort in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, among other things, chief of staff and former chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen was observed, the role of the troops.
"They were introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I am sure, the organisers have meant well.
I know that.
But there was no respect, not really. It was pity.
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and of the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are showered with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, service members.
The public is increasingly behaving as do the people in uniform.
"We were not victims," said Brigadier general Sean b. MacFarland, the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it is the only way of support, to put us in the role of unfortunate souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders, not the ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve, want to appear.
They have also recognized that the anger, the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War, was far worse.
As a result, there are discussions about compassion in the private sector between breastfeeding and war veterans.
After his two sons have returned from fighting with the marines, the former Colonel Mark Cancian, they warned that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would consider them with a sense of awe, since they defeated rebels and travelled to exotic places.
Others would wonder whether a "angry, violent veteran beneath the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and has taken a senior government post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interviewer subtly, whether he is able to immediately after his return from the pressure of a demanding post in Washington.
"If you talk about your service, you must keep their negative impressions about it," declared Cancian his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is rooted in the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Services on the battlefield will be in a country that has little experience with the military, and sees little value in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, singled out only rarely.
"We as a nation value military heroism no longer, as it was during the Second World War was absolutely normal," said Lieutenant General David Barno admiral, the U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of the politicians and the public mostly on the suffering of a service members.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends who have lost their job or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week is an important hearing on whether 28 men and women charged with failure to intervene in cases of rape in the military court.
If not, there are hundreds of plaintiffs ready for the next hearing.
Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldiers at night.
It was in October 2008 and they returned to their barracks in Mira Mar north of San Diego back from dinner with a friend when they met at a male colleagues, one of the 12 s, Pack beer.
He asked whether he should accompany them in her room for a drink.
"My alarm went on," said Lyman.
But the Texanerin premonition aside their concerns.
I thought: "Oh, no, he is 19.
He is from Texas, "she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they had gone to Lymans Zimmer, the man behind them, put them down and they were raped, it claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officials anxious to a process with a historic hearing Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a complaint against the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, made in court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld not against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional right of the soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, d. c., the complaint initially 17 claimants, but rose in the following months at 28:25 women and three men, who all claim that they were raped by soldiers colleagues or sexually abused, and that the military failed to identify and condemn or an appropriate jurisdiction after the alleged attack. "
Burke says that they had the top military leadership, because the problem there.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation to the leadership."
Burke also says that, since February contacted nearly 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: instead of all the claimants lay their eggs in one basket, so to speak, they will, if necessary, many more complaints in order to maintain the pressure.
The team of defence for the Defense Ministry, led by Federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a request to reject.
The files of the court, Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, first and foremost, that the military cannot be prosecuted for violations by current or former soldiers in the armed forces.
On the basis of a law of the Supreme Court in 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, is not the government liable for injuries inflicted on active service.
"The alleged damage during military service, the plaintiff," the document says.
The Defense Ministry denied any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950 s.
If women are still not allowed to work in the fight, the distinction only in name: modern wars have rarely clear-cut fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, particularly in contact with indigenous women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars killed 150 soldiers, two thirds of them in hostilities.
It is time to modernize the military, says Burke.
And it is not alone in their struggle: three further complaints except their are pending.
At Yale Law School, the veteran "Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four main military academies because of alleged promotion of a hostile atmosphere.
This independent, non-profit Vietnam veteran of America a lawsuit against the military, in which the "personality disorder" diagnosis, rape victims received for them to be dismissed from the service - a standard approach, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of the service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Their group filed in December complaint against the veteran administration, management of the war veterans), in which they accused their discriminatory practices in their dealings with entitlements for people who have felt, have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws was submitted independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties in Congress, which offer a number of leads.
In 2010, according to the sex Assault Prevention and Response Office, Office of Prevention and reporting sexual abuse), the Department of Defense 3,158 sexual abuses.
But most abuses are not reported at all, according to the Pentagon's own estimate of this number approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases occur each year.
The report, which was published in March, also investigates the prosecution rates: 2010, 20 percent of the cases in the military court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In Lymans case reported the alleged rape of the military police less than a hour after the attack.
On this night, she says, they have been asked 11 times, the details of the rape of a number of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape kit and the blood of their aggressor, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge during the hearing she was asked about the sex they had before the assault with her boyfriend.
Six people said as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day when the verdict was read out," says Lyman.
"I thought the trouble would use. I ran screaming from the courtroom."
"They brought me to the psychiatric ward and I remember that when I came back to my commander said: that was not his procedure, which was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to go to a military psychiatrist, who ultimately a personality disorder diagnosed and dienstunfähig said.
In January 2010 she was dismissed honorably, so that they receive no support.
Whether the complaint, the Lyman and the other plaintiffs have submitted progress is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University law School.
Nevertheless, it says: "I think they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that will, since it was the first time in question.
I am always a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military has lagged behind a decade because they do not possess the same incentive and deterrence, a liability.
He adds: "The odds are against them... But it is important for them to try."
These things will change only when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing will not follow their path, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, with its hundreds of other claimants for future cases.
"We will fight the military in this regard, pending reforms," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: how researchers watching you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik, the only one of many boys who signalled their anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who has committed a killing spree in Norway in July to have killed 77 people, its first public hearing in court.
Despite Breivik, may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent much time until his attack at his computer and gechattet with some of the millions of nationalists, the extreme right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But, as we find them?
This is easy - you just have to log on Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently published report by the British think-tank DEMOS on the digital populism in Europe.
Facebooks hide-and-seek personal data is so enzyklopädisch, says Bartlett that must use the researchers simply advertising tool of the side in order to determine their desired demographic data with scientific precision exactly - do as retailers for years.
Bartletts team found half a million supporters of far-right groups in Europe and visierte them with Adds, but rather with a new band or to connect a new diet product, invited the Adds users to a poll in which, according to their level of education, was asked about their attitudes toward violence and the their own future.
Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues were able to more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - not just once her office had to leave.
"It is a fairly new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results come as little surprise. Online supporters of far-right groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration.
But in a kind of surprising, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism more sensible, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens."
Demos work is just one example of how Facebook to be a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideenfabriken, medical researchers and policy researchers use the side in order to study everything from health issues to social trends such as "Likes ," text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users who add on average three content per day, generated Facebooks "data supernova explosion" a research boom, the number of scientific work, with the name of this page title in the last five years by almost 800% increase.
For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook that can be achieved by the people who do not normally with his Clipboard on the street.
"If you tried to ask people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to first inform the party and would never have access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook is everything away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the side a chance to see social and health problems to solve.
A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full binge on Facebook, are significantly more prone to problem drinking as students who remained silent on this issue.
Moreno proposes that equivalent students, for example, residential advisers to help monitor the side and a student if they too many status updates.
"They can't solve a problem, if you have not recognized," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co- author and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children's Research Institute of the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who otherwise would not have been found."
Facebook also zapft constantly data of its own population.
The data team has statistics on the types of status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the 2010 mid-term elections and produced a national happiness index (which has been used primarily according to the only Facebook access - master of digital freedom have long understood that should make the their great data treasure trove for other research purposes.) 
But the users of Facebook that the side they are, whether they like it or not. with a friend, is thousands of miles away, to be able to play Scrabble, allows the side's own personal data sown.
But what if the users of Facebook, part of a survey that they do not even know about?
While researchers have set strict guidelines as to how they collect data offline, everything is permitted.
"I do not believe that many users have even thought about the fact that researchers could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, a study in 2006, in which he explored the public pages of students on Facebook.
"It was just them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the claims in an user profile and in speeches.
"What you on Facebook and what outside of Facebook, are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore thinks Selwyn despite his years as a technology researchers that are a Clipboard and a pencil is still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for the real world and to talk to real people," he says.
"Social research must address the social dimension - and plenty of social life is still offline."
"Cold and inhuman ": Anders Behring Breivik, appears for the first time before a public court
Different Behring Breivik, the man who has had two runs amok, in which 77 people were killed in this summer in Norway, as a "resistance" kämpfer himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway," he said before a court with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court, because you support your mandate of organizations have received the ideologies of hatred and because multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the laws, but I plead not guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik, during this monologue, because he "wanted to give Breivik, the possibility to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he mitbrachte Breivik, an advance written speech, the permit, at the end of the hearing to the relatives of his victims.
Nesheim also ordered that the police Breivik, for 12 more weeks in custody, he has four weeks without access to the media. He said that the authorities will inspect all visits and correspondence about eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some were able to see in the hope that Breivik, in the eyes of, others wanted to confirm that he remains behind bars.
All took part with the aim that is based on a Wegschließen.
"I thought he looks cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it is a bit further, after I saw and heard the suspects."
Breivik, was wearing a dark suit and a blue tie and worked throughout the hearing, calmly and professionally. He looked journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breiviks bizarrem saying that he would be part of a larger "resistance" bewegung, the judge concluded that he was mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
It may have been some that the attacks of 22 July, was the work of an individual extremists and not a group of radicals.
But it's automatically the sadness and confusion, sensing a whole nation still?
"I wish he would look like a monster, but he does not," said the relatives of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons of interviews with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown this week in a theatre
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5. some compared him with Henry Ford and stressed the engineering genius as a large, modern inventors.
What Apple fans but perhaps the most telling in the recently discovered jobs interview, which was dusted off this week in particular film displays on the major markets, as has understood this creative head business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-styled Hippie, but he was also a careful organizer, eager to Diagrammen bastelte - a man who believed that many business leaders to "a disease of thought ,"" a really great idea accounts for 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product. "
1995, Bob Cringely the TV series "triumph of the specialist idiots" on the dawn of the personal computer, and he sat longer than a hour with jobs, in a rare, detailed discussions.
At this point in time than 10 years have passed since jobs were already had been forced out of Apple, and he worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and looked forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringleys interview was used in specialist idiots, he says that the Kopiervorlagen of interviews in the delivery.
After Jobs death discovered a full VHS copy in the garage of the director.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68 -minute film "Steve Jobs: the Lost interview ," Mark theatre this Wednesday and Thursday in the country.
For someone who is well known that he abhors detailed interviews, jobs are surprisingly busy explaining its technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly pause.
In the course of the interviews is four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds after its head, which weighs jobs clearly his thoughts and accuracy.
There are also moments when jobs" perfect for days when he seemingly impatient and anschubst him anschubst, faster on issues or minor acts. Responded to questions Cringelys
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the distress interview somehow incredibly thoughtful, if assessed jobs, what other companies he believes is right or wrong, and his own vision for the future of the computer.
It is one thing, posthumous awards the career jobs" to read, but to see jobs here as the thrill of dreamers, is poised to grandeur, is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Shortly after he had stated that everything here, and he made it.
A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of Verlorenen interviews:
As he learned to run a business:
"During the years I always wonder," Why are you doing things? "and the answer you get is:" Oh, this is done. "
No one knows why he does what he does. Nobody in the business think really hard about things.
I have said.
Jobs will continue its efforts to streamline the accounting for Apple.
Amazed how costs were recorded - mostly began with "standard costs" on mere suspicion towards quantified and then with "deviation" he adapted - developed an automated factory, who ensured that the business costs could be determined.
As has been veralbert the Pope:
Jobs told of the "Blue Box ," which he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device, in the telephone company could lead slip and long-distance calls in vain.
On the device was used a lot, but jobs enthusiasm, as he describes the Blue Box as an act of Selbstbemächtigung is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the Box, by using a gebührenpflichtiges telephone, a phone call and then an AT to another, while durchschleifen they so many satellites as possible.
"We sent about a dozen times around the globe, and if you go to the telephone, there was a minute later the telephone next door," told jobs.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something yourself can monitor the trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
Both of us, we did not know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a huge thing, it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that without it they would be Apple.
Jobs told from a glorious stroke, the Wozniak and he almost withdrawn as they have in the middle of the night via the Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk with the Pope, as well as they could nachmachten Henry Kissinger.
Because several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night were called to speak with the American diplomats, the two loslachen before the Pope even came to telephone.
In the technology smitten (and unprepared Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts, he sought to build a spectrum meters after Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called on him.
Shortly after their 20 -minute telephone call received a part-time jobs for the summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"This has had a remarkable impact on me, it was the only company that I had seen in old age, and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it with his staff."
Later, jobs was one of the HP employees, who visited the research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he "the first desktop computer that was ever produced ."
He was as big as a suitcase had a small screen with brown rulers tube and I am smitten with him.
I would at HP as a teenager and attached to the machine and programmes for them.
As improving innovation:
Several times in the interview speaks about how to invent new products spontaneously.
Early in his career, when he some circuit boards einbaute, he was asked by a customer, to assemble the entire computer.
He was working with a payment period of 30 days and had to both the assembly and the extradition of the finished goods.
Later Apple reminds him of the problems he had in the development of a computer mouse.
"I remember, forceful arguments... You shouted at me, that it would take five years [in order to build a mouse, which would cost $300] and I went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse, we are building for $15. it was an incredible credible.
On large companies that remain:
Long before he revive Apple, jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial giants with their visions in and lost control of their shares.
"We say that you are working with IBM, Xerox, so make a better photocopying or printer, na?"
They have a monopoly stock, so the company is not more successful.
Sales and marketing make it successful, so [there are] people who, which will ultimately result in companies and the product with which the people from the decision-making process.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly, will of the people who have no concept of good versus bad products, eradicated - craft art necessary.
This happened when Xerox...
Xerox could have the entire computer industry.
It could be ten times greater, the Microsoft of the 1990 s can be...
They have caught the defeat from victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There is a lot of craft art between a great idea and a great product... If you can develop this great idea, and growing."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
It must be votes, certain things that you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
We must remember 5000, these concepts and bring them all...
Ultimately it boils down to the taste, it is that they are trying to deal with the best stuff, have created the people, and then trying to bring these matters to what do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shamelessly stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, Zoologen, historian who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
It would not have been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the health care legislation, as a court case
On the same day that the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the political teilende question whether it will hear a challenge to President Obama's health law, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, at a dinner attended by the Office of the services that will take the case to Court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges to a meeting to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases was a complaint made by 26 States against the far-reaching reform of the health system, adopted last year by Congress, a law that was among the conservative activists across the United States to a buzzword.
The judges agreed with the hearing. Indeed expected in March, a 5 1/2 -hour bases discussion, probably the result of which will probably boost the presidential campaign in 2012, at the time of the court decision is known, will be in full swing.
The lawyer, who will face and argue in court that is to overturn the law, will probably be Paul Clement, a former Attorney-General under the administration of George w. Bush.
Clements services, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federal society, a veteran group that deals with the defense of conservative principles of law.
Another company, which has sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the Business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is financially involved in the outcome of the process enormously.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court advised on the case, in a Washington hotel.
Service, including Mitch McConnell, the leader of the group of Republicans in the Senate and sworn opponents of health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges visit for years the Federal society.
And that does not violate moral rules.
In fact, the judges of the code of conduct that governs the actions of the lower federal courts.
If they were, they would fall under principle 4 (c) of the Code, which states: "a judge can participate in fundraising events near legislative and other organizations, with the judge no spokesman, the guest of honor or according to programme can be a host of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme near Scalia and Thomas to two of the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest in this, morality and to alert government activists.
"The startling break with morality and the contrast with the code punishes the complaints of some judges lie, the court is the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the common cause-célèbre, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending proceedings at the court."
Her appearance and her support of a fundraising effort for this event undermined any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say that they would court matter too easily with groups that follow the agenda, such as the Federal society.
And Thomas" wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
By contrast, the Conservatives claim that it was Judge Elena Kagan, who have a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was general prosecutor under the Obama administration, when the first legal challenges in the first instance court.
Its critics, Kagan to withdraw himself from the hearing of the case because of bias, since it was involved in the defence of the law is to be impartial.
Kagan is not about to do so.
Boeing is attracting record of $18 trillion in country
Airline two-track Emirates ordered 50 Boeing 777 aircraft with an option on 20 additional aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It is a rare news that a company a contract on 50 of its products.
But it is a great deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co and the list price for the 50 aircraft will be a record amount of $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is the customer of Boeing, the Middle East, growing gold mine of future plane orders.
In a forecast, published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East over the next 20 years, 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion.
Boeing announced at the weekend, its biggest contract ever for commercial aircraft, as measured by the value of the order: 50 two-track Boeing 777 jets.
The gavel mission came from the Dubai airline Emirates.
The airline has also announced Boeing 2011 at the Dubai air show, an option to purchase another 20 aircraft, the entire lists price to $26 trillion.
On Monday ordered according to Boeing, the so-called Oman Air six Boeing 787 - 8 Dreamliner, the vastly improved fuel efficiency and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft is running at more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Internal Dihora, stock market expert from Morningstar.
"The quality of this particular customer is very high."
Many airlines of the Middle East are in possession of the oil-producing countries.
So they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but a rise in oil prices, which is usually the airlines, because this is one of their biggest cost items, not so bad, because the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important, because it is less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders, if oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural hedge," he said.
The order from Emirates reaffirms helps Boeing's leadership position in the market for large aircraft and to keep the rival Airbus SAS, which attacks the supremacy of the A350.
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the introduction of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777 - 300 ER.
It postponed the introduction, in order to gain more confidence, called the customers a higher burden of farm and reach.
The Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of Mexican President loses seemingly election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claimed to have supported the drug traffickers opponents Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for the governorships.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon has apparently lost its candidature for the office of the governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. They claimed on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, won the race for the governorships in the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and particularly yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls... You have occupied polling booths, road blocks built... And called on people to vote for the PRI []."
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are seeking a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes for victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo beaten Claderon seems barely to have led in the polls before election day.
Calderon, candidate of the conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN her brother, refused to recognise Vallejo winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which is currently acting governor, was ranked three, a heavy defeat for the split and hapless left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Also Aureoles refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers, and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels, which specializes in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch in December 2006, the military's offensive against drug traffickers.
The violence still continues.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while canvassing for Luisa Maria Calderon and many candidates have dropped out of fear for the local elections.
For the PRI strengthens a victory party, no matter how repugnant the elections in Michoacan.
The man who will represent the PRI in the presidential race is is Enrique Pena Nieto, from Washington congratulated and said: "I think that this victory makes us look boldly into the next year."
ADB urges Asia to aid in the rescue of the euro zone
The Asian Development Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the euro zone in its severe debt crisis, in order to prevent a long-term downward trend, the growth of the economy in Asia will slow down.
Rajat Nag, administrative director of the ADB headquarters in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world "must do" everything in your power to the recovery of the currency bloc, either through the International Monetary Fund to speed up or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), "" dispassionately look at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of the European leadership and helps to prevent the European resources through Asia a collapse of the global economy.
"We are all in the same boat."
"So everyone is helpful, can help Europe out of this crisis," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune."
"So, if China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe's monetary union has in recent months in a severe debt crisis.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs are dangerous and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece are resigned.
The arrival of heavy debt crisis in Europe raises fears that could plunge the global economy into recession and led to calls that the leading emerging countries should join forces to support the euro zone.
Mr Nag said that any support Asia is channelled through the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as buying bonds of the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - offer the European partners in Asia greater negotiating power.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the euro zone, because the economy is now suffering from falling exports and the drying up of foreign capital flows.
"Nobody wants to see the euro zone remains volatile and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing great challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It is not an option, it is a mandate, because where else are we work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies such as India have no reason to help the rich Europeans, if they are themselves facing huge economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at the American Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India aid for Europe, more than 800 million of whom live on $2 or less a day.
"Eventually, they will find that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and spend holidays on the beach, then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, administrative director of the World Economic Forum, asked, why should be used in India's reserves to Greece the numerous and well paid to keep employees in the public service, geleitetet with jobs in poor, multibillion losses institutions such as the railways.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the euro zone "significant knock-on effects" will have on the whole of Asia.
The ADB's forecast of a 7.5% economic growth in Asia for the years 2011 / now threatens "the risk of escalation," due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets "contingency plans" to prepare themselves for a downward trend and to protect a significant capital brain Wortschaften.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon possible cuts in the defence
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta inflamed Congress on Monday, as he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security. That set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the chessboards in Afghanistan and civilian conveyor belts.
The Pentagon already rethinking cuts $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fear that further cuts $600 trillion or more necessary if Congress could not reach a conclusion in the spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the Department," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
He said that a failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called confiscation, would lead to a 23% across-the-board cuts and an end to a large number of new projects.
"Such a large cut, carried out on such ill-considered manner, would make the most of our shipping and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernization efforts seriously," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate us involuntarily by a majority of civilian staff and that the reduction would be implemented as quickly as we would almost certainly civilians in order to achieve the objective."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and our alert seriously damage."
The cuts were in the combat troops, "said Panetta.
"During the war time quotas in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the seizure would adversely affect," Panetta warned the serious interference in the budget war efforts.
"Staff have been cut, leading to delays in the recruitment and hiring supervision, supporting the war, would lead."
"The salaries of the staff would be reduced to late payments to war time traders and the legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Defense Department would be a rapid decline of the United States as the leading military power in the world."
"We are strongly against these draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when they Panettas letter published.
"This is a result, we cannot live with, and it is certainly none that we should impose."
"The seizure is a threat to national security interests of the United States and their commitment should not be allowed."
Whether it will increase Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators, the pressure on a compromise on the budget or will intensify demands to exempt the Pentagon cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly outspoken said the possible cuts, although he has many years experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he arrived at the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he faces tough choices.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister a gloomy picture of what could be a military - with skin, but without a core.
"It is a ship without sailors."
"It is a brigade without ammunition."
"There is an air squadrons without sufficient trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to fulfil the mission," Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.
"It is an armed force, there is a lack of morality and alert and incapable of dealing with potential adversaries."
"It can be a really angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta new details of how reductions "creates significant operational risks, delays in times of crises, conflicts and disasters, serious constraints on our global commitment and response capacity, leading to an unacceptable risk in future military operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects the deletion could fall victim, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning stage.
To this list also includes the Fighter pilots F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bombs, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Coastlines Ship and the new ground combat vehicle, Army and Navy need in order to replace the Humvee.
It would stop the further development and testing of the F35, this would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but proponents say that it is an important next step toward rearmament, so that potential threats posed by China and other opponents can be averted.
How to lie revealed
A glance at the current headlines shows how serious and widespread deception and lie in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain, is the allegations of sexual harassment by several women. Both sides accuse each other of lying.
The leadership of Penn State is accused of Scooter, which has withheld supposedly reports that has abused a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
In the last week has been mitangehört on an open microphone mitangehört, as claimed by the French President Nicolas Sarkozy the American President Barack Obama, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies destroy careers, shaking countries.
The New York congressman and Internetexhibitionist Anthony Weidner was kidding when he said renunciations in circulation, which were very quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violations in Kampagnenfinanzierung in connection with the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one forgets that it has seen the media circus that has caused the President Bill Clinton, when he lied during his second term in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about Schummeln in school and college examinations are widespread.
There have been incidents where teachers have indicated their students" test answers, so that they themselves in their Leistungsüberprüfungen well.
Mentors to teach the opposite should send a message that lies and Schummeln okay.
How much deception we see?
As studies show, we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
Many of these lies but as white.
Another study shows that strangers to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting of lying.
Lies to or "detecting lies" is one that learning for every human being is important, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a parlor game such as host Aden, where the aim is to call "possessions you! ', is an Enttarnen of deceit a serious knowledge, based on scientific data collected over the past six decades of prestigious universities that had far-reaching research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
As a result of research is that most of the old myths about the lies were exposed.
Lies a look in the eye.
They sputter, fumbling, blush and zappeln not always.
They do not, however, that detect liars and difficult to treat.
An experienced Lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth, by something about the structure of the claim that the subtle facial expressions, learn about and timing.
I spent several years, the scientific results of the comprehensive and steadily growing area of exposing to investigate, and it is clear that this is a modern ability Enttarnen of deceit, which is easy to learn and help us in the Zurechtfinden in our complex world, especially if the closing or the questioning of persons or negotiations or management of its own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good to see other people to raise their interest and to control their own emotions. And they intuitively how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research, we know that extrovertierte people often lie than introvertierte people that men more often "selbstorientierte" lies more than women whose lies more "other" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that their partners less often than unmarried people lying married people (but the lies they tell that are mostly "big lies ").
We also know that if a person as a culprit was exposed, others feel less guilty, this person to have lied.
As you can see whether someone is lying?
First, while you watch the normal behaviour of this person.
This is called "Baselining," the starting position.
It is a point of reference for later assessment of changes.
You watch the attitude, the laughter, the quality of their experimental person.
They should know better, but when someone normally constantly with the foot behind, so that they are not wrong to blame him if he during meetings with the foot behind.
Then you accumulations striking verbal and nonverbaler behaviour.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells, bells, not as evidence of drug-dealers.
People who are, perhaps, if they try to remember their history. Perhaps their feet in the door or they are in the process, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxation after the recruitment interview," this deep, entspannende Ausatmen and the change in attitude, if all the hard questions.
Questions signal often mistakenly that recruitment of conversation is over, only to this relaxation after the recruitment interview.
You also pay attention to the language of your experimental person.
The gaffes of Scott Peterson is famous, as he used the past tense, as he claimed that his wife was killed still live and a national search for her.
Deceptive individuals can also use a sporadic language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky," or if a vexed question repeated in its entirety.
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a vexed question: "Well... To tell you the truth... As far as I know... In good faith."
This will give the answer wahrnehmend rather than factual, which often sounded the alarm bells.
There is no magic remedy for Enttarnen of lies, but you can learn skills, which is a drug-dealers.
Thanks to these skills can be any more victims of fraudsters, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan for a pipeline will be revised after exposure to delayed U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration has threatened the approval of a proposed oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico and at the same time to delay, which the unions angered environmentalists, is that the pipeline would provide companies sought to plan the project so that we can return to normal.
Trans Canada said Monday evening that will reroute the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of Sand Hills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building by Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of trans Canada said that the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision regarding a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course, reviewed the area of Sand Hills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major water supply, a smokescreen.
"This is a real step forward," said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska to Fox News.
The new Umweltüberprüfung, has ordered the Foreign Ministry, may defer a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision was a task for the State Department and said his support.
The 1700 -mile pipeline, linking Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
This would have to pass through the pipeline in six states.
Environmentalists they hate, but labour markets love it, because they appreciate that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators Nebraskas who are against the plan, if the laws, a departure from the region of Sand Hills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the State Department has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the main auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was stopped by Trans Canada, Paul Elliott, who was 2008 adviser to Hillary Clinton, is mired in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company contracted to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice, as it is with trans Canada.
Patti LaBelle indicted for allegedly forced a toddler from fear to erbrechen
A New York family claimed that the night-club has-been Patti LaBelle in the lobby of their Manhattaner building a Tobsuchtanfall their small daughter had to fear that they are.

"We want Patti LaBelle takes responsibility for their behavior," said Davis.
"This type of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if there is a kindergarten teacher, a 18 month-old baby on the arm."
Climatic Offences retarded economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez in the government, rose in Sinaloa unemployment and undeclared work, while the foreign investment and the economy stagnated.
2011 will remain in economic history Sinaloas. It is the first year, Mario Lopez Valdez, who described himself as the initiator of change and great hopes on the economic growth in the government, but as a result of the climatic adversity can be no question of growth, on the contrary, the most important economic indicators.
The low temperatures in February not only caused millions of euros in losses in agriculture, but also the growth of the state economy close borders and caused a general decline in economic activity in the first quarter of the year at 3.6 percent This is mainly on the historic 31.16% reduction in agricultural development at 31.16, which had a hindrance to further economic sectors.

Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year is due to several factors. The economist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the School of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented on the policy of public institutions declare indirectly the growing unemployment.
"What we are seeing is a rise in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, including loss of liquidity in the market as a result of the cuts by the legislation, which was adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because those who stashed accumulate dollars, it is not easy for this to work, to invest or to use it for anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the idea of growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people in the country to search for work abroad, especially in the United States, left, has decreased. That is due to visa problems and on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work. These people remain here and looking for work, with unemployment," he says.
Undeclared work

Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the chamber of Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (state of manufacturing in Mexico) that in 2011 no efforts to harmonize the views of the various sectors, including the country's government, has been made.
"Economic activity in Sinaloa this year was very poor. It needs to be worked hard to regain the lost ground this year and 2012, we need to double the efforts of all and in particular the progress of the already well matched eingestimmte government teams have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.

The court approved for the 2015 transition to digital television in Mexico
The switchover from analogue to digital signals in recent years, the world's most important changes.
The Supreme Court SCJN (Mexico), the constitutional complaints submitted by the Senate and House of Presidential Decree, must be brought forward and, in which the switchover from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to lack of eight votes that are needed to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered the President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded its powers, legislative decree with the details of the switchover to digital terrestrial television.
This decision was rejected by the Senate launched constitutional dispute, because he was not required qualified majority of eight votes so that the court could decide on the constitutionality or not constitutionality, and so the law remains in force.
In the project for the lawsuit, which was drafted by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, has been proposed to explain the decree law unconstitutional, since regulations affecting the radio and television the Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federale Commission is responsible for telecommunications in Mexico), which is why the hierarchical principles and the legal reservations would contradict.

"I do not believe that if we were to do that would undermine the independence of the regulator." they also pointed out that the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, the state government is responsible for constitutional reasons, because this is the state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals through digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in the world over the past few years, and it makes a better use of radioelektrischen spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
Pushing the conversion, said it was postponing the enjoyment of digitisation, which is a decision in the public interest, not only technical facial points, "because it covers economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, they stressed that "the actions of the whole system is needed, in accordance with the principle of economic management by the state, a group of characteristics, the Constitution in the hands of the state government."
She called that have carried out many countries around the world, the digital conversion, and the government, although they have highly specialised facilities.

In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last 9 November the election rather than a set of rules for the harmonisation of local rules with the reform of the federal states had adopted in Electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán neither his political constitution nor election law nor its law on the election of justice had adapted to the reforms adopted by Congress, so this round were not in force in this election. The governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State Gazette within the allotted time with the argument to have any objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislature and the voice of the State Ombudsman to the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal" because this does not have the right to "decide or impose a veto against it."

It can be counted under the following conditions in one or more electoral votes packages contained some of the results in the protocols do not agree; the Protocol on the count and berechnung is not aktenmäßig, or it is not in possession of the chairman of the electoral commission or there are obvious errors or amendments in the protocols.
In addition, the total count of the full pressure of ballot papers, if there is a difference between the presumed winner and, in the second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided at the beginning of the session is an explicit request of the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the candidates.

On Wednesday the formation of the new Italian government
The prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present this new government, the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse, is to offer.
The prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present this new government, the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse, is to offer.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that on Sunday appointed Monti would meet with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday, in order to confirm the formation of the government.
It is expected that he will present a majority of technocrats" cabinet, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will assume office.
Monti said he would present to the president of the results of the talks with the political parties to form a government.
"I would like to express my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner journalists.
Monti has not explicitly endorsed the formation of the government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles are overcome.
The "framework is now well established," he added.
Monti has succeeded in less than three days to form a government, which is much less time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy fights against a political and financial crisis, which has driven up the cost of debt in an intolerable level.
The new government, the former EU Commissioner Monti must adopt a tough austerity package, which was requested by eurozone politicians, in order to restore the shattered confidence in Italy.
The pressure to hurry on Monti, enhanced by the volatile market situation, as a result of the Italian government bonds for 10 years with 7% interest rates, with the state, which have forced Greece and Ireland to request the European rescue package.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian industrial association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti with: "we said we would support this government."
We believe that this government is the last chance to make Italy emerges from this emergency.
Monti's chances of success by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign as a result of the crisis on Saturday, expanded significantly.
"We believe that the efforts of the professor, Monti is to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because until now, many of its members against a majority of existing government of technocrats, Monti is just said.
Support from Parliament
The new government led by Monti needs a strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Opposition to his efforts or delaying the reforms could deliver a devastating attack on the financial markets again.
The Italian Association of foreign banks, with his suggestion that a failure of Monti was also pressure from a disaster.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and employers" associations, and with youth and women's organisations.
Tuesday evening is to be completed the session.
Monti was appointed by Napolitano this Sunday, who has an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a breather at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, have achieved as a result of the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the cost of the Italian government bonds reached critical limits.
A bailout of Italy with a public debt amounting to 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the EU's current rescue package.
Monti has said that his government until the next elections will be held, probably in 2013, despite predictions that the politicians will give him time to implement the reforms, instead of the elections.
Monti said he would like to politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should only consist of technicians, a reference to their concerns about the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources indicate that the mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties, the inclusion of people from political life is complicated.

More than 20 years, they have been expected, but the band rest assured that it is a dream, if they play in Costa Rica.

For Costa Rica's fans realised a dream if Pearl plays jazz jam in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means for your fans?
In Costa Rica to play is a dream come true for us.
This is just the second time that we play in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I am only once, on holiday in Costa Rica. It is a beautiful country that we will remain there for a few days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music.
I ask you that because the fans of the band. They are flat in the days before the concert.
What does your begeistertesten her fans?
Thank you to all these years on our side.
We have spent almost 21 years, until we have arrived in Costa Rica. Thank you, waited so long to have and we are very sorry for so long, until we got here.
Some people even believe that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Is it not a bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows that we have made over the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.
We have played on a few giant shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that have made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Indeed, we have to play there.
We love this country, we are happy to surf, and the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
As you know their Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friend, and I have a wonderful friend who lives in Tamar Indochina, where the waves are unimaginable.
My friends are always went surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico are excellent places to surfing. In this way, people who love the surfing, we have learned from it.
With an eye on the tour have offered their giant shows with many songs.
What plans you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Because that is where we never played, we also have no borders.
We will try to provide the best possible showdown with many different songs, we want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
She repeatedly your repertoire.
Why?
I believe that this is partly because we have nine plates and can play about 120 songs, like every other song, so that the decision, which we each play, is not easy.
If we have two or three songs that we have played no longer, into the repertoire, we can protect our focus better and they surprise us, because they the reasons why we have taken these songs. Otherwise they could be it.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore, for the audience.
With this tour celebrates your twenty years of history.
If you look back at you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yes, completely.
First of all, I believe that none of us has presented once in a great rock band to play, and also for over 20 years. It's like a dream.
We also continue to this, and it is great to be able to make music together.
We can and we are thrilled to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to travel to the places in the world, we have always wanted to visit again.
Things could not be better.
What it meant for you, attended the birth of the Grunge actively to have?
It has always been a honour to belong to this group of large band.
We are good with the people of Sound Guards Mudhoney and Alice in Chains friends.
It is surprising and rather unusual, if it is a movement from a group of friends.
Occasionally, a band from a city, but it is unusual, if five or ten groups simultaneously from the same city.
We are proud and feel honoured to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we play still together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Sound Guards on their tour, we are pleased that still to be friends with them all and it is a credit to us to be part of this Seattle Sound that have arisen.
It is also very unusual that zusammengeblieben a band like the with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us play have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron), 13 years ago. this in itself is a lot more time to survive than many bands.
First of all, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive and also we care about each other.
We are all close friend, why have opened up musical, which give each individual's freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and its music, and it could not be better.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy. On the other side konntet their thanks to your success always do what their Yugoslav.
As a balance?
The way in which we have grown, has made it easier to find a balance.
We are sure to be not too often on tour, because it is too easy to this game with huge numbers of people who love your music to go.
As long as we think that the people because of the music, it reminds you that you are the music and what it has created, must be careful not to be determined by a famous rock star. It has never interested anyway.
What memories you have of your project Mother Love T-bone?
I believe that we have very good songs written at the beginning, it was great.
We were a band for three years, until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) had never issued a disk.
We were disappointed, for so long. We are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), with the band, a friend of us, when I hear a song or see photos, I think what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to work together to laugh and talk about music and football and many other issues.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic bond Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that she knows her work, especially Eddie Vedder, you have chosen and the band for the opening?
Yes, the production of videos of several groups and the band liked best and that is why we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer, which will certainly exciting live.
Why does the text of yellow Ledbetter whenever it plays live?
It is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he can offer.
By whom got influenced you as Bassist?
So many +
Among the first to come to mind include Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, c. j. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I all afternoon on Bassi, I liked to talk about.
As Pearl jazz jam has managed to keep the Grunge alive, although it is no longer a fad?
I do not believe that we all feel very attached to the word Grunge.
When I think about it, the band, which I mentioned earlier, for example, Mudhoney Sound Guards nirvana and all the others who, at the same time, if they are still important today, I think it is great, because it is worthwhile to hear this music and bands such as Mudhoney make better music now than ever before.
Initially, their music was dark, now it is positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I believe that there are a couple of songs on the new album, which might seem somewhat lightly. But there are also other songs such as the End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, even though they have something positive.
The two came to tears when I heard how Ed they played, they are very dark lyrics.
I believe that if you are older and something drastic happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - influenced your artistic creation and your music and these two songs embody the clear for me.
However, I also believe that a happy man and can put dark music.

"Mario is the figure who must say how the Stereo copy work without glasses," said Omar Alvarez, who is responsible for the Nintendo press specialising in Spain during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said, "Super Mario 3 D Land" was "the first video game from Nintendo, which has been designed from the outset of this console ," because until now were successful articles such as" Star Fox 64 3 D "or" Zelda: Ocarine of time 3 D "adaptations of existing titles.
The spokesman for Nintendo said that, although it is being watched three-dimensionally, "Super Mario 3 D Land" a "affordable" video game that a quick, like liquid.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3 D Land" two games in one: the first part is "easy" to the less geschckten users.
According to the experts on the various levels of the game, which will be increasingly difficult to be a "second round ."
In addition to the users in real time between an aggressive "D" or one that affects only the depth of the action, and to overcome the obstacles, without the victims" optical effects "must be played but always three-dimensionally.
This excursion Super Marios in the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this zwinkert Nintendo video game fans of the saga, and repeated the recipe for success of the recent spending: the schnurrbärtige plumber must overcome with threats demanding platforms in order to liberate the Princess Peach.
However, the players on news of the movements, the environment, the guises and enemies - and a "spielbaren" Luigi.
Colom bears witness to the extradition to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, this Tuesday announced that he would grant the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo, so that in the United States for conspiracy to money laundering of U.S. $70 million.
So that was the end of the process on the request of the United States to extradite Portillo, so that there can be brought to justice.
In a press conference, Colom, his decision based on the independence of the judiciary and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that he had not intervened during his government in court decisions and all extradition requests, of which he was informed, was granted.
But Portillo be Sergio Ruano Marroquín for murder and serious bodily injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's approach is an act of government, which, if all legal and constitutional bodies to conviction of former Staaatspräsidenten (2000 - 2004) have been exhausted.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth International Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court, Guatemala must be extradited Portillo, if his legal situation is resolved in Guatemale and guaranteed his human rights.
Portillo was acquitted for the embezzlement of 120 million Quetzales in the Department of Defense during his time in government. This negotiation was the extradition, but the minister presented a contradiction and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people at risk of social exclusion
The organization was created to avoid the marginalization of young people without professional training.
The first 25 years of social welfare organisation Trinijove have led to significant results: in this quarter century were 6000 young, supported by the social exclusion of vulnerable people in order to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition there are over a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary yesterday at a meeting in the former station buildings Fabra i Coats, attended by over 300 people, stock.
Trinijove was 1986 in the neighbourhoods Trinitat Vella launched with the aim of young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems were threatened by the risk of margins to help.
At yesterday's ceremony in Sant Andreu many senior facilities and institutions who have worked in these 25 years with the club.
At the time of the election campaign, the participation of political representatives of different directions, the impartiality of the work of Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas and his predecessor, Mr Pujol participated in the celebrations of the former socialist education minister Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and current left green city council Ricard Goma.
The great hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current resolution minister for social affairs and family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of the social the savings bank La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that was launched in very difficult times and that today's times no less complicated. But he added that the work done so far "is a good basis."
For the President of the Generalitat Trinijove is an example in the fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in trouble.
"The economic crisis is for the club and the work he does, nothing new," he said.
Occupied house, were held in the Riesenparties, was cleared
The homeowner had 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in the street Balmes No 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve House occupants left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbours of the House No 51 on the road Balmes an end.
Twelve people yesterday lunchtime voluntarily left the building, which they had occupied illegally and organised huge festivals, which had driven the neighborhood to despair. The evacuation was carried out without a court warrant without police intervention.
After the evacuation was replaced the door lock, in order to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on will be controlled access, confirmed the House managers."
The house occupants who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply, and they had the walls left angemalt and all types of waste, especially doses of alcoholic beverages.
In the bottom three floors were celebrated huge parties, which lasted up to two days and turned the tenants to despair.
In addition to the building is a disco Balmes 51, which was also damage.
The winner, Maria Pantinat Europe Press said that their business has fallen by 80% since the beginning of the house.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the House occupying their unfair competition because they sold the drinks to three euros, while those in the disco EUR 10.
In addition, the owner of the neighbours due to disorder reported, according to their statement of noise, while not derived from the visitors of the disco, but by the Hausbesetzern and, in particular, the guests of the festivals, where they were organised there, and according to the disgruntled neighbours in recent weeks, more and more and more.
The leaders of the disco said that the harassment was so great that it came with the owners of the building, to pay for the last nine months no rent.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police force) also confirmed that they have received in recent weeks more complaints from the neighbors.
The Chairman of the Partido Popular - People's Party (PP) in the city of Barcelona Council, Alberto Díaz Fernández, called last week to evacuate the building immediately and the problems of civil coexistence and to get the Herunterkommen of the city.
He said that was occupied by the summer just a floor of the building, but that the house occupants in recent months in all floors of the building and almost all homes. In some there was even a burglary.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity, and crack down on anti-social behaviour in the building."
Yesterday was another building in the city quarter Nou Barris by the Catalan police.
At 15,30 p. m., the police the streets Montral No 35, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed, wanted to invade as four people in the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects, in addition to the disputes about the fees with the tender.
The urban tender on 16 doors opened the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980 s, at the height of the now vanished Spanish Metropolitan Bishop Ana de Barcelona (CMB), published this administration their Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even in figures compared with the Central Park in New York.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many to the ceiling of Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and bottom (Sea).
The classification Collserolas as a natural park playing with this idea.
As a model was no longer the Central Park, but yellow Stone with wild boar in the role of Yogibärs.
So far as it was, as the city in September a giant tender, consisting of 16 competitions for further access gates after Collserola.
No doubt a gateway refers to the concept of the parks.
Either that, or someone at the gates to the country.
The question is: Collserola, parking or mountain?
The tender is not only from an organisational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city as a topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a rekurrentes issue that two members of the old eingesessenen caste who meet in the elevator, can turn.
And it is this fact provides the fuel for one of the rare common ground between what think three architects from Barcelona, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary," after the attack on the coast on the "frontline" in the mountains, "the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, on the green apples, were not held.
"We should start from the principle that is the park overlooking the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex, "judging the architect, for the title" gates of collserola "a" "is in itself: they must not" imagine than access to a park, but as a narrowing of areas where action must be taken. "
Modol how Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as a "intellectual challenge ,"" some risks ."
Risks as a result of the "uncertainty, which entails the creation of a public space today" after the experience from the 1980 s in the field of Forum had their "swan song ."
The first fear is its own limits to what can be developed.
"Something always means to determine the next step," i. e., to cross.
"We must consider a new urban planning instruments, because the current [regarding the plan General Metropolitan Bishop Mariano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, keeps close to the matter, says that the side of Collserola towards Valle Sana, "can be understood as a park, not in the direction of Barcelona ," for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the patronage de Collserola, not the "should fall on deaf ears ," although he was grateful that it has given his body, the possibility of this project" from the outset ."
In addition, it says that the proximity of the city of escort letter that allows architects to participate in the debate, although he has expressed his "doubts" about whether this technical profile which launched multidisciplinary teams (" exactly the right thing, "he says," We should architects should only be a tool. "
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of the article is complex, because in the tendering conditions of Collserola lack a global vision: "there have been advertised 16 competitions in the sample," he says, "on the axis mountains. But there is no Längsschnittperspektive, considered the territory in its entirety."
This has led at least in his case that he attends the 16 championships.
Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a gateway would clash with the architects of the Tors.
In his opinion, should guarantee the city that is the Strip directly on the Ronda de Dalt in its whole length, which is a soft transition between city and green zones.
Casino awards Jonás Larrazábal, free,
After 72 days of silence liberated the attorney of the Monterrey casino Red brother of the mayor of the process, is being conducted against him because of alleged blackmail.
After 72 days in captivity is Manuel Jonás Larrazábal released after the attorney of the casino Red him before the Second Criminal Court of the Javan, the trial of the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for blackmail, has awarded.
After the attack on the casino Royal Gil Sergio García, the owner of the casino Red, a series of photos and video clips is Manuel Jonás, allegedly forcing him to pay a sum of money, so that the City Council approved the secret operation of the Wetthauses.
After the criminal complaint, the prosecutor's office opened a criminal case against the panistischen mayor's brother, who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours with the officials of the Ministerio Público en 3 Delitos Patrimoniales he was taken to the Casa de Arraigo 1 in Barrio, Guo of the capital.
He remained in this place 49 days after a second arrest warrant after the officials rejected Ministerio Público the offences of corruption and organised crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the detention centre of Cadereyta, because he had allegedly bribed the owners of the casino Red with one and a half million pesos, however, it was only a few hours in the middle row security because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to attend the trial as an inmate of the urban prison in San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was the secretary of the Second criminal court of the Javan, Jorge Yánez, sent to a prison regulation, which found that after almost two months of investigations have sufficient evidence to speak Jonás guilty for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the Wetthauses this opening this in return.
This Monday asked the attorney of casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, Judge José Luis Pecina, the brother of the mayor's sentence, and he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing asked Ramiro Arias, the officials of the court assigned Ministerio Público, García Gómez, whether it was repaired and what the owners of the Wetthauses his forgiveness. The lawyer said the name, however.
According to the 197/2011 Jonás Larrazábal. Also following can be no objections to the process, and no compensation.
After the hearing was the agent of the Wetthauses around 15,50 pm was Larrazabal Bretón immediately.
The justice secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the urban prison in San Nicolás de los Garza to Jonás that he had been acquitted and would put his case.
He also informed him about the judicial order the immediate release.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details about the plane accident in which the government secretary, Francisco Blake and another seven people died.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (secretariat for communications and transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the inquiry about the accident, in which the government secretary, Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people were killed, point out that the helicopter with his whole intact structure directly on the ground, without the pilot would have been able to initiate an emergency landing.
At a press conference earlier Dionisio Pérez Jácome, the secretary for communications and transport that would have confirmed the pilot before the launch, the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the Propellerflügel 25 metres altitude contact with trees, and the helicopter lost the rump, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several contacts soil."
He also said that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, and he met all the conditions for the transportation of staff.
He also said that the investigation in the area, which was decrepit machine, there was no helicopter parts.
"In the search found no aircraft parts found in other places, the premium was on the whole structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, which is why he met all the conditions for passenger transport.
The area has a Schrägung from 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority, the results as soon as possible, but this could take several months, perhaps even a year.
In turn assured Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat) for aircraft and emergency services in Mexico that the helicopters flown by the Estado Mayor Presidencial in charge with Reisefluggeschwindigkeit and the plane had fallen to a soft Abhang.
"This information reinforces the assumption that at the time of the collision was a normal flight operation."
At a press conference was the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, six important points that should be taken into account in the investigation.
Visual flight:
In line with the standards was a flight to the rules of flight, which means that we should have had the team during the flight and ground sufficient visibility.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start. During the flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico state took some deep low-hanging clouds.
Elected routes:
It is possible that selected the team because of the clouds lower area with better view towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Aufprallstelle:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording the helicopter agree. It might be before the collision with neither a loss of control on the plane, a deviation from the flight route.
The remnants of the plane were scattered in a limited area:
The until now available information indicates that the helicopter was aufgeprallt from unmarried partners and seitlicher direction.
The pattern of the plane scattered debris that was aufgeprallt the helicopter with its intact structure on the ground.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the plane at the location of the accident to offer close to fire or explosion.
The latest findings indicate several soil contact.
During the on-site investigations found aircraft parts to a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is abschüssig and has a Schrägung of seven and thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to rupture.
Some information indicates that the helicopter could have had several soil contact.
After a painstaking search in an area that transcended the shut-off area at the scene of an accident could not be found scattered aircraft parts, which reinforced the assumption that the caring aircraft structure on the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to the discovery of the gene for obesity in
It is Mexico's social security fund a research project for the location of the gene for obesity in children and young people, which is supported by the IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano - IMSS del Seguro Social (Social Security Institution Mexico) announced that it is a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and young people under the title "genetics of obesity in childhood and youth" is to be found the genetic markers associated with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, the head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Division for medical research, focus biochemistry) in the clinic Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI stated that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, health workers, food specialists and social workers.
This team will be supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate studies at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The public is invited to participate in the study, interested parties can come to the sports fields of IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8,00 am tests with children and young people.
He stressed that the investigation at the sports venue of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) began, and since 8 October at the sports ground of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) will continue.
If the target of 500 to 600 people, the study achieved at the sports venue of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and the continued Moreley (in the north of the capital district).
He said that the aim of the study is the understanding of factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people in the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the anniversary of the diabetes worldwide, he said, it will seek to three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 years with the consent and under the supervision of their parents" nutritional questionnaires.
You will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family medical history, risk factors, which could have diabetes or kidney failure, to control.
He also said that, as measured by the so-called Saturdays investigative persons (weight, height, Taillenumfang), controlled their blood pressure and blood values such as glucose levels, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (the identification of genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López stressed that this would take place at the concern of health staff about the alarming weight gain in young people.
"The health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 that had increased in nearly six years, the proportion of obese boys at 77 percent of the girls with obesity at 47 percent, and the obesity has risen dramatically," said the expert of the IMSS.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because of differences in the genetic history of the Mexican population from that of other peoples.
He stated that a (e) Mexicans (in) to 65% on average indianisch American, to 5 percent to 30 percent of European and African descent, reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and obesity.
More generally, he said, the genetics of obesity in the inability to press the surplus to us of energy (calories) to burn, so that it will be stored in the form of fat.
The researchers said that the direct benefits for the participants, in a comprehensive study of the children, which would be whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even the of a different skin wrinkles in the neck and arm of the Interior (Akanthosis), the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes at the preliminary stage, investigated.
All information would be kept confidential and told the parents in writing by the doctors, the doctors tell the parents all measuring results and beat them with lifestyle changes, which are for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz said López, there were three fundamental factors for being overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, lack of movement in everyday life, to spend most of the time of the day in front of the television and transport to go in for short distances on foot.
The high caloric intake, in other words, an increased consumption of gezuckerten drinks and Standard (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.), together with a high fat and protein intake and genetics in this research project is to be analysed.
Asphalt from UNAM prevent potholes
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of Chemistry at the University of Mexican UNAM developed with Polymeren modified Asphalte to the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
Would the message emanating from the road surface, respected, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 000 potholes, when the rainy season in Zona Metropolitan Bishop Ana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the School of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if it were the travel and the maintenance of Asphaltbelags, the number of potholes significantly reduced or avoided altogether.
In his lecture "bumps from a technical point of view," he said on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible for developing with Polymeren modified Asphalte to produce a similar mix asphalt, but greater mechanical resistance in both high and low temperatures.
Mr García-Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot climate, for example, some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the surface and to avoid the appearance of blow holes.
He said that the asphalt - the hardest part of oil - a hydrocarbon link, which is part of a high molecular weight - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part of the low - the so-called Malthene. Together they give the road surface typical zähelastisches behaviour.
Zähelastisches behaviour of the Asphalts means that the high temperatures approaching 180 ° C behaves like a liquid, it is very viscosity at 120 ° C and 50 ° C, while he is in very low temperatures.
"This is not the resilience of the Asphalts on the road uniform, but on a day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations ," the chemical engineer.
The researchers said the FQ, the majority of the streets of Mexico City had a flexible road surface from six layers of material zusammensetze, of which the last three asphalt.
Between the upper classes is a layer of asphalt, from small asphalt gebadeten and then entrenched stones.
Each piece this decay class, had been sweating in asphalt.
If the vehicles themselves, and generating forces, this class is a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, would distribute the forces even better," said the chemical engineer.
"On the decay class," he tells us, "is being interpreted a final class, the so-called Tragschicht, which consists of tiny stones, from sand, sweating in asphalt.
Since this class in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need greater mechanical force than the wear-and-tear class and they must produce friction.
The road surface receives most forces and distributed the Tragschicht also needs an appropriate thickness and material from which it is, must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular, moisture and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, above all, the water, "he said," because it affects the behaviour of the decay class significantly.
If the was wet, water in the class and only difficult. This caused a watering down of all sections of the surface and, consequently, the incidence of blow holes.
If there is a pothole, "he said," will first of all the deck flattened class, while the decay class afterwards, but the damage was not immediately affected, but it is a process, at the first sign of proper maintenance programmes should be maintained. "
Which is a member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores Nationales Research System (Mexico) said that the vehicle is another important reason for the incidence of blow holes, so must the thickness of each layer of the surface are always in relation to the vehicle, and it must be ensured that in order to frequent blow holes this regulation will be met.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research to achieve, for example, Asphaltemulsionen who are in other countries already on the market, and the potholes and repair without application of high temperatures.
What was missing the candidate del Valle, the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors is that Melina Ramírez Serna the crown of Miss Colombia is not.
EL Valle receives his 14th misstitel.
Once again, Valle del Cauca empty in the awarding of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time had to be Melina Ramírez Serna content to stand on the winners podium, a silver crown and the band, a new Miss Colombia, to them.
With this night received result in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico the crown and the cedar, has joined the Americas at 14 Miss title and Melina to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had kept the crown almost. Among the Misses proclaimed: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rosemary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question facing many today is: What was missing?
The decline because the result is a big favorite in any projection had shown that they had everything to the new Miss Colombia. It was not in vain, the Queen of the police and the Mejor sandbanks Jolie Vogue, who had also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor is seen as crucial for the jury's decision to appoint the first failure, is that the answer to the question "which book has influenced you the most and why?" by Martín Murillo Gómez Carreta litre Arias Leamos was not convinced.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca the questioner replied:
"I read a lot, I quite believe in the literature, I think it is a kind of more civilised, ultimately, I believe that the book that shaped my childhood," the Little Prince ', is a very deep.
At the moment I read "crime and Punishment," it is a book of universal culture that we should read it. I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian girl, a beautiful book, "passions'.
A response that was met with skepticism, firstly because of "civilise" and, secondly, because they do not specifically how each of the book they had improperly.
But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina, to feel calm and happy with the outcome: "the universe is wise, it is what has to happen.
And for all people: please read a little bit "The little Prince '. it is a great book.
Among other things, that is out of love of El Valle.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the Priority measures that all Beifälle einheimste and received in advance all prices (gastronomy competition Easter, public vote on the best handgeschneiderte costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates jealously what stresste the Queen, who could not shine on the stage."
And that, in its first presentation in a bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and two lifts during the coronation ceremony.
Although she appeared safe, lacked the strength and momentum, the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "Como en casa" the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, "shows that the candidate who wins the most prices during the competition, not ultimately Queen '.
It was at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle Jurie could not convince regarding their interest in social work, which is the essence of the National beauty contest.
There must be a reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty said they sought a woman who stood up to the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty for Miss Colombia alone is not enough. We must look beyond the Körperliche and focus on the social sense, that they are already participating in the competition had worked on projects," she said.
There is also speculation that Valle with their defects of Derriere and fibrosis, said her in the stomach area, had sinned, but this is controversial, because the jury chose it as a candidate for "natural beauty with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán said, is that Melina did not have the best body that there were better, "but the problem with the fibrosis in the stomach, for me, honestly was hard to say, put their score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believe that the mistakes of the woman from Valle del Cauca were subjected to the surgery, which they had been.
"The operations are OK, but Valle did not know how they should get it right.
Her body has never been their strong side, and they had to pay. "
Because of this prize, the first time by the National beauty contest, after the appearance in a bathing suit a cruel prediction, which should be in the middle of the night. It was getuschelt that had been Raymundo Melina a consolation prize, they enjoy the crown.
Whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina today their for a year, not as the Queen, but as a princess, a position that offers the opportunity to represent the appointment of the National beauty contest Colombia in an international competitions.
However, it will be one of the queens, who had escaped despite their overwhelming outburst of Cartagena, go down in history.
It was the work of the doctor, who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoskopist from Cali, as the man who "Alfonso Cano" identified in history.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On 4 November was a Lophoskopist of the investigative unit of the Public Prosecutor's Office (CTI) from Cali, as the man who the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) confirmed: "Alfonso Cano" by comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of CTI, had this week'Elia Tsar González on-call service, a man from Puerto Tejada in criminal investigations and proceedings for the last 21 years.
At the beginning of his career Chocó González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to go five days in the jungle, in order to achieve the place where the bodies were he should identify.
2000 siedelte after Valle on and after the completion of the necessary specialized courses on Lophoskopie, which is investigating the skin is exposed to the friction, that is, the flesh and blood.
In the week the use against so-called Alfonso Cano recalled'Elia Tsar, put clothes for at least three days.
Great things expected of him.
Friday night he flew in by helicopter Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that the man, who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world, could be, which is why he should the Ten fingerprint sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name) take.
When he reached with the Untersuchungste the place where the corpse was, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, which resembled the images he had seen in the mass media, not in the slightest.
He had a beard and was dressed like a farmer in the area, no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass to ink a Pflanzkelle and a pocket lamp'Elia Tsar compared the fingerprints of the cadaver with fingerprints on the story.
He had seen right: It was "Alfonso Cano."
Nor was this the same night from Puerto Tejada originating man responsible for the defence minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón that it was the leader of the FARC.
To trace search
For a Daktyloskopen by Sijín in Cali was the acknowledgment that the President Juan Manuel Santos'Elia Tsar González at a press conference on the use of "Cano ," very important.
Many people are not familiar with our work.
The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the dissolution of a criminal offence.
Lophoskopisten not only identify corpses, they also support investigation of murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of those arrested.
When they were arrested many offenders false identity papers, or they have not.
We take the fingerprints and look them in the database.
The researchers told us that he is in a theft had to grab a piece of wall of a house, because the thief had aufgestützt precisely at this point, in his hand aufgestützt a cramped safe herauszog with jewellery and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surface are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case, we have the imprint of the machine and the offender, who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
The fingerprints can also be burdened murder suspects or discharged.
Recently, a was surrounded by bottles of spirits.
The investigation was that it could be a family member under suspicion and, in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, but the place where the offence was committed, in context.
A Daktyloskopist CTI declared that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical Reagenzen the object."
If they appear, used a Pflanzkelle or a band for the carriage.
And then sent the prints to Asif, the criminal database, or to marital status.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians undocumented," said the expert from the CTI.
He said that not everything is as it was portrayed in the TV series SCI.
As gold is not all that glitters is not everything it touches, a fingerprint.
But it can be used to launch an appropriate comparison.

Japan is born again after the earthquake
The GDP grows at 1.5%, thanks to the domestic consumption and stop the cycle of free case from the beginning of March
Since last March was paralyzed the Japanese economy, which is still in recovery after the devastating earthquake that einmündete a nuclear crisis and the worst disaster that Japan was the 2th World War II.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo, the property damage at $300 000, a blow that despite the difficult world economic situation, it seems.
After three quarters of, the claims of gross domestic product from July to September to finally close this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% on the year hochgerechnete rate.
In the second quarter measured value - in Japan, the business year in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the sale of machinery for the rebuilding areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Indeed, the companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decline for capital expenditures, which were recorded between January and March, the first decline after six months of relentless increases.
Nevertheless, it is not the actual reversal of the Japanese economy exclusively from Keynesian dose that use the crisis to build infrastructure and build new ones.
Woke up Japan in particular thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, initiated by the increased spending on cars, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of yen
Tokyo has entrusted to the domestic market, after the yen, the Japanese currency - in one of the "safe haven" currencies of investors who, prior to the debt crisis of the euro zone and the bleak forecasts for the U.S. a. flee, a privilege that is like a tombstone in on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency are the products more expensive abroad, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the big technology companies.
Toyota and Sony, for example, led their weak business results from July to September on the listing of the yen.
While the markets continue to peripheral EU countries, the government Yoshihiko Noda vigilant.
"We must pay attention to the continuing risks, for example, the deterioration in certain foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday, the secretary of state for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are not really very aufheiternd.
The Organisation for economic Cooperation and development (OECD) said that most member states in September clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development.
The indicator vorausnimmt the turning points of the world economy, brought to light that would be considered among the greatest economic potential the brakes.
Because he fell by four tenths to get 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro zone, even below the average, which stands at 100, having fallen by eight tenths of 99.13 points.
Athens is again doubt
Papadimos says that the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives are no written agreement
With the soaring risk premiums way of the peripheral countries and spreading uncertainty become lost Greece further into the labyrinth that breaks the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek interim government is a response to pressure from Brussels is a genuine conviction of political forces is slowly by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Mr Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there are no alternatives to the structural reforms and that at the time of his appointment agreed a hundred days may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, the new austerity measures and support his call for new elections on the planned date of 19 February, will withdraw.
"The main task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," assured Papadimos yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will meet tomorrow with the vote of confidence in the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, the reform of the disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, it does not Samaras communication doubts about his position: "We have committed to support the transitional government, but otherwise nothing."
The Conservative leader was a step too far with its challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body of the 8000 million that Athens must entsperren. He made it clear that he would accept no commitment on the implementation of the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is concerned about the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum still confirmed again yesterday, their request was not to shake: the economic aid would not signed, if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek political parties" not a clear written agreement as soon as possible. "NONE.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the troika "very soon" were returning to Athens to discuss with the new government, "for the payment of the sixth tranche" of EUR 8000 million "was needed ," although there is still no final date.
The Greek tangle has for a while.
Queen Sofía: "They are instruments for progress and hope '
The Queen said the "dominant" position in relation to this type of financing
"Spain has a dominant position in the role of micro finance."
The Queen Sofía of Spain reminded yesterday that Spain in the last two decades, the world's second donors have to this means of international cooperation. The "essence" is based on the fact that it is a "tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for the whole of humanity on the basis of trust in the people ."
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the fifth World Summit on micro-credit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that these kind of deals "absolutely vital" to achieve the United Nations until 2015 the millennium objectives and "in particular, the number of people who have to live with incomes of less than one dollar a day, below the poverty line .""
Spain "continues" to the network of beneficiaries" until the last corner of the world, and it is this task responsibly, "said the Queen Sofia, hopes that the initiatives and contributions of the summit, which lasts until Thursday," the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest people, and especially for women "as the main beneficiaries of these loans are guaranteed.
"We have had many successes" and "face many challenges."
The summit on micro-credit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform to push "two fundamental objectives."
The Queen, said it will seek to have until the end of the year 2015 175 million poor families access to financial services and that ten million of these households exceed the poverty line.
The concept of micro-credit in Spain and the rest of the world back to the way "initiated by Muhammad Yunus" years ago, the Queen Sofia as an" act of justice and recognition ."
The father of this financial instrument described it as a "admirable idealists who have committed to the fight against poverty" and whose work they have known for 15 years, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh, the lending strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later, the first world summit in Washington and further meetings in Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all "we are seeing a steady development ," said the Queen, whose commitment to this project their yesterday's assessment as" head of the family "in Valladolid and as a" champion of the poor ."
Finally, the Queen Sofia ended her speech by Queen Sofia to participate in the debate and the search for solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative '
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity "an ethical imperative" for the whole of the democratic state.
In this sense, they stressed that it was a mistake to link aid in times of economic boom, because it would be a "lasting commitment ."
Jiménez was of the opinion that the microcredit is a "serious and rigorous policy for the eradication of poverty ," and that the governments of the industrialised countries" now more than ever "to work according to unified criteria, should not be allowed and that the solidarity of the crisis.
For Spain, the microcredit, "one of the most important forms of aid."
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success ,"" marginalized "people," always closed doors "to give" hope "and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, was staying in a city," their doors, infected by the spirit of solidarity.
The CDU proposes that the EU president to choose on the basis of general vote
The first day of the Christian Democrats (CDU congress on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig was for Angela Merkel, German Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic party, without any real trouble.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but has been held in the autumn, particularly those activists would be enough to ensure that the government policy with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.
The presidential motion proposed by the Bureau of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Among 1001 delegates voted against only nine, ten had abstained from the vote.
The standing ovation lasting several minutes, on the basis of their first Interventionserlässen Angela Merkel and Wolfgang Schäuble, a few hours later, the three European secessionist-minded Finance Minister no doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor, as well as the application - following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "there are nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
The Chancellor is "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could come through the control of the European Union a reinforcing modification of the Lisbon Treaty on the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro zone, as could be, however, in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "to give Europe a face."
However, this is definitely one of the request for proposals adopted by Congress, which was clearly Wolfgang Schäuble godfather.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 rapidly on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the matter, and the chief of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
The milestone is, however.
Also rejected the delegates in an overwhelming majority, the proposal of the weighting of each country in the Governing board in accordance with the weighting of individual economies, which would be an awakening of Germany's position.
To calm the climate within their party named Chancellor has reinforced the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. They did not, however, their Congress at the expense of "small" or in difficulties European countries to criticise the arrogant Germany.
As far as the importance of "Franco-German friendship ," calls Angela Merkel France devotes a paragraph on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because it reminds us that Leipzig two centuries ago was at the centre of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the zuhöchst humiliating defeats the Napoleonic army.
What represents the fraud in sickness?
After the family allowances are UMP and the government now sickness.
Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday, 15 November arrive in Bordeaux to go to a family aid coffers and a speech on the - since 2007 - always recurring theme of the fight against fraud, as well as social, economic dependence on the state.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to put the economy in a tough test, on the other hand, no less a harbinger of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, wants to focus the majority of workers sickness.
With haushaltswirtschaftlichem objectives: the government is seeking the introduction of a fourth day of leave of a sickness occurrence of workers in the private sector.
In plain English, this means that a sick workers without approval of specific company would lose the wages of four days, at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure which, according to the newspaper "Les echoes" anger threatens to provoke would, however, to EUR 280 million.
And were accompanied by a different measure rather symbolic nature: the state officials unvergüteten day of leave in the event of illness (so far there for them, the Gegensatze to the three days of leave in the private sector, no minimum period).
Meanwhile, these issues in the debate, the majority also of the issue of fraud, and this time aimed at the abuse associated with labour shortage.
"Checks will be much more important, and there are rückzuvergüten, if requested," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the station RTL.
As in other cases, the impact of this news about the reality of fraudulent actions seem a little unproportioniert in the areas of sickness.
This is in fact, already since 2002 under constant observation and political campaigns, which have borne the most fruit.
The French are no longer ill more often than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, the first nationwide paragraphs.
According to the country's sickness benefits CNAM were paid out in 2006, more than 237 million daily.
According to the Institute of Economic Research and Documentation of health care, the daily compensation in 2008, with 11.3 billion euros, 5% of health spending.
Under this amount fell 46% on maternity leave and accidents and 54% on sick leave, i. e. EUR 6.2 billion euros.
And so, 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010 the French were granted to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group on average only 14.5 sick days.
Midway, covered up the differences: a, in 2007 by monster. Com, a website for career planning, was published, showed that 75% of the 40 surveyed 000 individuals French workers, not a single sick day.
Another, this time by the health insurance, study makes it clear that 37% of the sickness in 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% were between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% of between one and three months and 11%.
Compared with its European neighbours, not the French workers more than elsewhere to incapacity.
One in 2010 of two researchers of the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) long-term study showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (disease or otherwise) oszillierte, and in France between 10% and 11% to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% the United Kingdom, or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in sickness is a tiny proportion in terms of undeclared work.
The fraud is achieved only a weak levels.
Encouraging the legislation since 2002 means that there is systmatische controls on sickness, which exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public school for education and training of technicians and engineers) noted below 1.5 million checks that 13% of 285,000 of the past, short-term sickness, which in 37,050 cases, "unjustified or too long."
In the systematically controlled hospitals reporting cases of more than 45 days duration was under 1.2 million 11% "unangepassten or unjustified" cases, which is 132,000.
Overall, this makes 169,000 cases of "unjustified" several million workers who have made use of a sickness occurrence.
A paragraph, which represents only a weak levels such as those of undeclared work.
According to the UMP MEP Dominique Tian, who in July published a report on this issue, that is between 9 and 15 billion euro tax loss of earnings per year, i. e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus far more than the Defraudation last.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece have to absorb its economy needed a new adjustment programme.
This has had on Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced before Parliament Anfügen the fact that his government from the Union granted one hundred days were not enough to carry out this task.
"In order to be able to continue the efforts to bring about a comeback of the economy, we need to support our European partners, as well as a new programme budget adjustment," said the head of government in his first public speech in the Eröffung the debate on the confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro summit on 27 October to be the "primary task" of the new government, the participation of the country within the euro zone "at stake ," he added.
According to planned m. Papademos, the deficit of the country, "the 9%" to reduce the size of today until the end of the year, this was 2010 10.6% and 2009% in 15.7.
The rights rejected the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, leader of the right-wing, had on Monday gave its approval to the approved measures in terms of the to escape from the debt crisis, but said that his party would not erkären to an additional austerity measure.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during an assembly of his new Democracy party.
He had with the aim of the reduction of budget deficit and debt, as well as the fight against the waste was hostile to any policy that would stop the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, with economic and monetary tasks betrauter EU Commissioner, who had prevented that release IMF and EU the necessary loans over EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee of all parties on whose support the planned release, Antonio Samaras had replied that his word, and he would sign anything under pressure from outside.
Euthanasia and suicide free death to be legalised, a panel of experts
The Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada says
The panel said that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked on schmerzlindernder treatment in order to provide the best palliative resources, and also about the cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in an attitude towards the death.
Only 9% of Canadians are in fact, to talk with their doctor about conditions under which they wish to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of a magnificent report by the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts in various disciplines, including ethics, law and medicine, are interlinked.
This body recommends the government to amend the criminal law, in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this election, and in patients who are considered to be in a position to make such a decision.
As a prelude to the experts cite a recent poll by the independent society EIU, who had compared the death in 40 countries of the Erdballes.
Although Canada has placed on the 10 th, the study noted that "the medical Sterbebetreuung in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to bring up the subject of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers, tell us the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the overwhelming desire of Canadians to die at home, however, 68.6% of those in hospital.
The whole country, the rate of 86% in the hospital deaths occurred in Quebec.
In the sensitive issue of euthanasia and begleitetem suicide, the authors of the report's conclusions that the position of the federal government, which has already said, any changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and begleitetem suicide, illogical.
But now there are, according to the experts who have inspected alike all those countries, whose approach euthanasia and assisted suicide legalized or decriminalized, no evidence that such decriminalization abuses in its application, would lead to the practice of euthanasia or begleitetem suicide unkompetenten or not consenting individuals.
On the contrary, encounter a lot more cases of such violations in the countries that are not legalised euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, as yesterday Jocelyn Downie, a signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is illegal in Canada, where they are clearly."
"Suicide suicide is practised in Canada, although clearly illegal," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are in favour of euthanasia
Let us remind ourselves that had already carried out in 2010, according to an Angus Reid poll said 85% of Canadians in favour of euthanasia, since they are of the opinion that this would allow people at the end of their life journey to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that was not the issue of euthanasia, to convey the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people less value.
Regarding the persons who already have an assisted suicide, representing 41% of respondents to the view that this should not be prosecuted.
As for maintenance or suspension in patients is concerned, the situation is less clear, as the authors of the report.
Similarly, in its recommendation list that should be stated that the criminal law that the dumping of the funds, which have been a legal opposition, should not be regarded as criminal.
The panel of experts also requires that should be trained health care professionals in the duty to respect a possibility of funds at the end of life, and this without fear of prosecution.
The panel said that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked on schmerzlindernder treatment, in order to provide the best palliative resources, and also about the cancer cases.
Finally, the body of the Canadian institutions for health care, far-reaching means of pain relief or lebensabschließender measures used at least to consider, because this is neither as euthanasia have served to reduce physical pain and spawned in the same procedure.
Reservations other experts
Some legal experts in the field of health care have reservations about the conclusions of the experts" report of the Royal Society of Canada.
Council Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has the attitude of the berichtsunterzeichnenden experts described as "extremely ," among other things, because of the practice of euthanasia practice in hospitals in the final stages of any borders.
"This opens the doors for a situation in which everyone, lebensmüde and more than 18 years to ask someone else to help him in his suicide," RA Deschamps, who had looked through yesterday a summary of the report.
Council Deschamps stressed, the authors of the report seemed to be the responsibility of the individual over all other values that are involved in social fabrics of society.
But now, he says, there would be "guidelines and obligations in a society."
Margaret Somerville, one-rule-for-one-and-one-rule-for-another health law, also has a "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which they described as "per euthanasia manifesto" not long ago.
Margaret Somerville, who is himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts, in particular, the report claims on the failure of abuses in certain countries in which legalised euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.

The United States, for its part, the "intensification of consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime" as a result of decisions made by the Arab League and the European Union welcomes.
"The international community, the United States, EU, Arab League and countries such as Turkey have given the repression in Syria, an ever more fiercely tone," observed Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.

Russian scientists helps the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko has helped Iran to develop a nuclear weapon detonator, confirmed on Monday, a specialist on nuclear risks, American NGOs.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is the result is based on the recent report by the International agency for Nuclear Safety AIEA and other documents emanating from the U.N. agency to identify the scientist.
Last week the AIEA had its "serious concern" at a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to eingehendem study of AIEA documents by ISIS, the 1934 Danilenko apparently born since the beginning of the 60 s over three decades in a Soviet Militärnuklearzentrum worked in Chelyabinsk (Urals), and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
1989 or 1991, he is said to have left the center in order to start a business in Kiev, the Nano "diamonds ."
The economic troubles of his company had led him in 1995 to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Before his return to Russia, he then contributed to an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report mentioned the AIEA "strong indications that Iran's development of a" Nuklearsprengstoffsystems "had been supported by the work of foreign experts, familiar seie not only in this technology, but also, as a member of the state agency, for his entire professional career on essential to this technology the military nuclear programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and offences have increased by 50%
The crimes and offences against Muslims have risen by 50% from 2009 to 2010, whereas other racially or religiously motivated violence, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, in the same period either easy or have increased.
According to this data is the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49%, whereas a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% fall in crime directed against Jews and an overall increase of 14% of religious crimes and offences had been recorded.

"After a slowdown in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offences rise again," said the Human Rights organisation Human Rights First ." the increase anti-Islamic acts of violence is particularly significant, "the organization issued a communiqué added.
"Human rights First had long stressed that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes should be considered as a serious breach of human rights," Paul Legendre, a representative of the organisation.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added that under the police attitude towards the "hate crimes" could be carried out.
"Hate crimes" in the U.S. federal law as inherited from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence directed against race, colour, religion or ethnic origin, and now also includes crimes of a sexual discrimination.
Twitter is changing the platform, and more and more resembles Facebook
The micro blogging website Twitter on Monday introduced changes to the presentation of their platform, in order to allow their users in particular, to monitor the activities of those who follow their entries, which the service once again resemble those of Facebook.

Austria
Registration of a "golden rule" in the constitution
The government in power in Austria of the large Socialist / Christian Democrat coalition has decided on Tuesday, a "golden rule" in the Constitution, in order to reduce public deficits and a possible degradation by credit rating agencies in Austria's top credit rating (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann highly personal, this decision ends of the Council of Ministers, although the Austrian state public debt at 74.6%, much of the by the Maastricht Treaty set criterion of 60%, well below the debt levels of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"The solvency of Austria in one fell swoop from AAA to AA +, we would have to pay each year three billion euro interest rates," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Christian Democrat.
Austria is also a requirement of the Brussels summit of the Member States of the euro zone on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had requested the inclusion of reducing public deficits by the end of the year 2012 and a return to balance public accounts in the Constitution or by adopting a similar law.
The subject of the Austrian government is similar to the "German model ," since Germany was the first European country to such a" rule "was included in the Constitution.
Until 2017 should the structural budget deficit every year at 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP), down from 2017 should not exceed the structural budget deficit of the state of the 0.35% of GDP, whereas should the regional states as well as the communities balanced budgets.
It is in the horizon of 2020/21 budget debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht agreement.
Strong yen
Noda is threatening a new intervention in currency markets
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that would make the Japanese authority once again in the currency markets if the yen continues to rise.
"We should have a" excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen "see, we will intervene, just as we did last time," said m. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen once again close to historical levels, which the Japanese authorities had forced the intervention on 31 October.
On this day had sold Tokyo massive yen against the dollar, in order to reduce the Japanese currency value, which is hitting a new record against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has risen by doped regularly on purchases by investors, the value of the yen as a "refuge" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell on Tuesday below 77 yen, the euro is below the symbolic bar of 105 yen near the levels which had getriggert the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008 - 2009 listed the dollar around 120 yen, the euro is more than 160 yen.
This is the motto is hurting Japanese exports of the archipelago, as the cost of the "Made in Japan" products more expensive and reduced the products of Japanese firms from abroad, income, since these convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling after the earthquake and tsunami on 11 March, the region Tohoku (North East) devastated, for its reconstruction," said m. Noda, who feared that the rise of the yen could kill the weak recovery in the seeds.
The third world economic power, with the growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the previous quarter for the first time this year, thanks to the sharp increases in export and consumption of the disaster "plombierten" budgets once again gained traction.
The Prime Minister, however, that the rise of the yen, "Japan's economic foundations" who reside.
The Finance Minister Jun Azumi has, for its part, the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee has urged to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the Institute, has informed, however, the BoJ have already taken "appropriate measures ," which he said liess that no additional monetary easing is expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the Federal Reserve their Staatsobligationsankäufe at 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion) to cover amounts that they had used for purchases of securities to flood the market liquidity.
Eurozone:
Zinsfüsse skyrocketing, stock markets are back
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis consistently European indices.
Despite the official opening of the new government in Greece and Italy and the best growth figures in France and Germany weakened Länders rates of Länders steadily.
The stock market, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro zone, drifting this Tuesday, 15 November, a little more in negative milieu.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 am and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London, at 0.1%.
"On the basis of new tensions on the yields of government bonds in the euro zone in difficulty global stock markets continue to produce some of their recent gains.
"Investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of infection," says Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters press agency.
The stock market in Tokyo, which is part of the renewed fear of market participants about the capacity in Europe that andauere the debt crisis, had closed with a reduction of 0.7%.
"" Japan has directed as well as the rest of the world has its eyes on Europe, and the trade deals on a limited variation corridor, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised, "estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund managers Ichiyoshi investment management.
This revival of the concern about the future of the euro zone is the single currency, which continues the Baiss on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level for a year and a half months.
The European currency was worth 1.3570 newborn at around 10 p. m., so they were at 0.4%.

The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
The loan rates of Italy and Spain continue to be very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10 -year bonds at 6.85%, the Spanish title having to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France continues to feed the fears of investors.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti called for by the markets more time to restore the paralysis of the debt burden threatened situation in Italy.
For its part, the new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed the implementation of the occasion of the summit on 27 October of the eurozone decisions are "the main task" of his government.

For its part, Germany had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
An initial projection of the euro zone is expected at 11 p. m., with the EU Commission warns against the risk of a double-dip recession.
Energy policy:
Facts about dogmas should win
There is a matter that is not be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of, this is certainly the energy policy.
Availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of businesses.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting as a reason to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only if they explored the whole economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should their opinion on objective facts, rational data footing.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, the demographic evolution a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, will have to a huge share of the world's population on a vital element.
At the same time to alleviate the shortage of fossil resources in order to consistently produce electricity without the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from the environmental debate lost subject, forgetting to combat climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident changed any of these parameters.
Therefore blebt Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decision, the need to find a replacement substitutionsfähige source, even in Switzerland, the barely intends to build only nuclear power plants in the last generation.
Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few states to pursue their projects against continue with determination.
The United States have decided, after Fukushima to connect their park another unit, using the following the nuclear accident in Three Mile Island plant back in operation.
Even if the on renewable energy sources, German model is presented as a model, contradicts the reality of the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be in the form of an increase in the price of electricity prices, by the increased use of gas imports increased energy dependence on Russia, in particular, an increase in the gas and coal-fired power plants, CO2 emissions.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark is cause for reflection.
Denmark is on the one hand, European leaders in wind energy tables, from which it takes 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas, used in rotation with wind energy; so are its CO2 Ausstösse and its electricity prices by 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy pay our neighbours a contrary to our French households higher electricity bills by 40%.
Because the price of energy in the globalised economy, a key element of competitiveness and stability of the industry on national soil, the French companies on the basis of the cheapest electricity in Europe an advantage.
Any significant reduction in the nuclear power would therefore a strong increase in the price of energy, which is the noble statements about the re-industrialisation of our country and defending the purchasing power of illusion.
Polls showed that a price to pay is the vast majority of the French nor prepared, as opposition to the principle of this energy source.
Let us remind ourselves that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to build an industry with 125,00 direct and 410,000 inferred jobs.
Due to its strong export nature brings with it a host of small and medium-sized enterprises on the international markets and makes these creators of countless jobs.
Should France to take a decision to withdraw from nuclear power, it would be the most of these SMEs, and the annual 6 billion euros of capital goods and nuclear energy exports would wither away more and more.
The electrician would work at sixty years designed EPR, if it is inevitable that the decline in its producers?
In order to solve the energy equation, there is also a little like a devil a miracle cure for producing electricity.
Developed by the company Areva, low-carbon solutions for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy are testament to the complementary nature of the energy sources.
To maintain the highest possible level of safety for nuclear power is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a security authority, the clear and transparent controls in existing plants such as construction in Flamanville.
The working teams, who have made a name of their professionalism, the security idea just obsessed.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has seen three serious incidents.
Only one in Three Mile Island happened is under normal operating conditions; so he was without consequences for humans and the environment.
Chernobyl was the drama created by reactor design and unendschuldbares, causing human error.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented scale that caused the deaths of several thousand people.
The nuclear industry will learn the lessons from this accident, as well as they did so after the two previous.
As a result of this approach and cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and manufacturers of nuclear power plants, the EPR draft, which enable resilience in the face of such phenomena.
Under the electrical engineers is deemed desirable, to build a nuclear power plant, it would be a freeze in Flamanville a legendary gift to the competition of Areva and EDF liesse by giving them free rein to the position of leadership in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is inevitable and legitimate, looking for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible, emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber a debate, the equally determined with economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration is a burden or opportunity for the economy?
Under Nicolas Sarkozy's immigration policy has been criticized for a variety of angles - congestion of police, judicial and administrative bodies on the basis of the figures submissive policy, this policy with the status of a "country of human rights" as France had branded themselves.
Recently, the harassment against foreign students of regulatory side, the interior minister had the weeks look passing (see Libération on 23 May) announced that it has "no talent, a bricklayer or waiter from abroad is needed.
But this policy was analysed only rarely from an economic point of view.
There is a wide consensus on this issue between right and left.
The right-wing side was the tone of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including about 2 million immigrant workers, should be no problem for a country," from the left side by Michel Rocard, who had made 1990, France "could not accommodate all the poverty of the world."
The only difference is the level of generosity
The fear of invasion of national soil by hordes of Polish plumber was shared in 2005 on both the right and the left.
Both camps were perceived the immigrants as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference in the level of generosity, and is willing to admit the immigrants.
Francois Hollande is limited in its programme on trite to point out that partnership development will allow it to our "migration" problems to solve.
This idea of immigration as a burden, an issue that can affect the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As the economist Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book in mind, the latest findings on the immigration (Exceptional People: How migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pages), a broad consensus exists among the specialists about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants to economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Limit immigration would weaken growth and labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that these threaten indigenous workers, especially the less qualified to replace, putting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are more complementary than than the local wage workers, because they are jobs in sectors that are unausgelastet arbeitsplatztechnisch.
The low skilled immigrants work in sectors that indigenous wage workers, the higher quality among immigrants working in dynamic sectors in which the training is not in line with the labour supply.
Positive wage effect
As well as a surgeon would have difficulties to work in a country where there is a lack of Anästhesisten that complementarity between locals and immigrants have a positive effect of immigrants immigration on wages and domestic labour market situation.
In this way, Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants miteinbezogene long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9% herbeiführe.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas put forward by the immigrants creation and is conducive to economic growth (high proportion naturalized immigrants under American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The migrants also contribute to net the social systems, in European countries on average in excess of 1% of the total budget.
The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, at the age of 30 years after Germany sea person the public budget, on average, about his life a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of EUR 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start of his mandate, the lack of contact points "with the teeth."
The question, which should deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, to rethink the European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset, there is also a sensitive material.
The European continent should remind themselves, who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, the entire 20th century on the tragedies of the First World War, of totalitarianism, of Holocaustes, of the gulag, but also in Franco's Spain, Salazar's Portugal, and the Supreme in Greece have had to endure.
Some were believed that it would be sufficient to exercise the right to vote, and is progressing possible way to democracy to prevail over their enemies.
We know since Napoleon "small" that it was a feature of the spirit.
Universal suffrage, the necessary condition of democracy, this is not sufficient, condition and may well become the "repressive instrument ," as it was at the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot."
No democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation of powers and control, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe, we find ourselves in is an economic crisis, but it is also very first and foremost policy and democracy crisis.
The change of the Greek enabling cardsharper referendum would have had twice insightful character in this respect: once the need for a strong return policy, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing sense of the impossibility of their Unangebrachtheit.
This ambivalence should be seen as outdated.
The truth is that have shifted to the front lines of the democratic fight today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain, in order to push for the success of the national referendum, which was organised by depending on the needs and perverse sequence.
A free licence for European absolute ruler or a leap with in the emptiness of the nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizens.
No, we want to Hackebeil, but a collective task, quite rightly, clear and steadily, an election and democracy, this time at the European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one, moreover, was no longer know where to put an end to the list - because there is only one crisis, and that is in Europe.
It is an Europe that is bowing to the dictates of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from his powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is an Europe that is humiliated at international level.
It is concerned about sovereignty transfers in Europe - it is the whole of Europe, which gradually loses its sovereignty, and each individual achievements nations.
The urgency is to give the popular sovereignty, the leadership of the European project back.
Because it is located on the whole, whether the Europeans reduce the burden of debt, from the markets open and to build a future investment.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level on the condition that can be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, without us quite sure to destruction.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors, the Socialists for a long time, but today every European economic governance.
I agree.
But without political integration and greater democracy - as they have in mind - to the citizens, would be a folly and another impasse.
We need to take a new stage in European integration.
In France the Republic to arise, it took the fact that Republicans to "create ."
The revolution in interests alone could not enough.
This instruction remains valid.
We must form an economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European popular sovereignty.
We need to create Europeans to Europe.
"Kontaktlose" smart cards are audience
The world Exhibition of smart cards opens on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in more optimistic attitude their doors.
The year 2011, according to the smart with a 11% increase in worldwide sales of Mikroprozessorchips (debit cards, telephone SIM cards) end up with more than 6 billion units sold.
The tragendste segment is kontaktlose technology that enables the payments on public transport or settling purchases by is quite simply the card to a reading device.
Compared with a year earlier sold 320 million should be sold this year, 460 million kontaktlose smart cards worldwide.
Their market share should increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and about 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million) cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payment after the Asia Pacific region for a long time hinterhergehinkt.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and accept 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, the modest beginnings: only 400,000 kontaktlose Visa cards have been distributed.
The consumer markets make steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued this year, 2.5 million kontaktlose passport master cards.
To move on to higher speed, it is now necessary for the banks to provide their customers with these cards.
"Two great French financial institutions have committed themselves to distribute to their customers in the future systematically bank cards with peppers kontaktlosem chip," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment via mobile phone
However, this is only a first step on the road to the payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A very small percentage of equipment is so far with the implementation of these transactions necessary NFC technology (Near Field Communication).
"They are lagging behind."
"But they should know at least a real upward trend next year."
"We expect in 2012 with the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide," says Marc Bertin, chairman of euro smart.
But the banks take initiative.
The, Credit Agricole had yesterday announced the launch of a Testlaufes in Caen, which will take place from December until next June.
The iPhones some 200 customers and staff should be equipped with a detonator, kontaktlose payment.
The BPCE is conducting a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale had testified yesterday to prepare for the arrival of an offer to their customers kontaktlose payment via mobile phone.
Terroristenfront goes, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relationship between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The long suspected of relations between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram appear to confirm.
On Sunday confirmed the Algerian Vice Foreign Minister Abdel Kader Messahel itself that Algiers now "become certainty."
"The way in which both organizations act as well as the relationship between the intelligence services indicate a clear cooperation," he said without going into detail.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigation on the last January kidnap two French citizens in Niger have promoted interfaces.
In a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi kidnapped Antoine de Leo Cour and Vincent Delory on subsequent days, at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation carried out by French special forces have been getöten.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found in the rubble at the site several phone chips, which were the terrorists.
Terroristenachse
The analysis conducted telephone calls leads to several interlocutors who are stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI) the investigators, in particular, the numbers of two interlocutors: a number leads to a Nigerian who for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, had been the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is the Aqmi and close to the sect.
"This is a step forward, but there is no doubt that we must wait for clearer evidence before we can talk of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"However, it is conceivable."
"We know for years that the sect financial and intellectual support from foreign, and that has become increasingly active," reduces the Nigerian researchers Kunle Amuwo.
In the last few months are these "assistance" in the process has become increasingly evident, as well as the speeches and the modes of operation of Boko Harem, are now on the arrival of suicide bombers and the use of always complex explosives, such as those that have been used by Aqmi.
The international community to begin in Washington, since that time pressure on Abuja, so that they are for the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have deemed the grouping in for a long time as a community of Illuminaten, which must be paid no special attention.
Faster success
In 2002 in Maiduguri in near a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Imam Mohammed Yusuf's Boko Haram - which in Haoussa means "Western education is a disgrace" - following the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim northern Nigeria.
In this poverty-stricken region is the fisheries-linked rapid successes.
They politicized and used strict adherence to Sharia, while their achievements activists in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists have first churches, bars and authorities.
2009 showed the activists of Boko Haram with their increased attacks against the stations particularly active.
However, the response from Abuja is indifferenziert as usual.
The army surrounded the city, including 800 deaths.
The of Mohammed Yusuf was killed in prison.
As a result, the sect has become increasingly radical and leaving their strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, they attack in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, then another in Abuja.
In June, will be allocated to Boko Haram blamed a Selbstmordattentates, which took place in the secured police headquarters in Abuja, the first of its kind.
In August the local headquarters of the United Nations to international priority target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, from Mauritania, Nigeria, Somalia, concerned since all security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and Niger, the Al Shabaab Somalis in Kenya, Boko Harem a new threat seems to be in the centre of the continent.
Last week warned hatta Alain Juppé at a Gespräches with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Boko Harem and has shown itself willing "to tell all the evidence."
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry competing in simplification and lack of knowledge about China, Iraq and support for Israel.
Can a krisengeschwächtes America a complex world with simple, not to say: silly ideas?
If you listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters could almost get this impression.
For several days to Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their supporters their thundering declarations and statements on foreign policy, traditional republikanischem focus, reported.
On China, Iran and Israel aid - often based in any way - slogans.
The appointment of the "Grand Old Party" at the highest rate of Mitt Romney threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and the "currency manipulation" - leading issue in an America that the exodus of entire industries to Asia strongly - to accuse.
Stupid, if this is to imply the introduction of a trade war, he said.
Jon Hunt, a former ambassador to China under Obama and one candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost about his emotions schmeichelnden management strangled.
He had a solid, but constructive exchange of talks with Beijing (also called Obama's current position).
But Hunt will not be met, because it is stagnant in the polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran if sanctions fail to halting the nuclear programme.
"If I am elected, I leads Iran had" on hearing it.
"Obama is elected, they get the bomb."
He has promised Israel increased military aid and accused Obama, this partner commitments.
The businessman Herman Cain, zweithöchst platzierter candidate, for its part, has a shameful acts ignorance.
Recently he called to give the Chinese military threat against, because Beijing "trying to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to ignore the fact that China is already since 1964 in possession of military Atomarwaffen.
The Texas governor Rick Perry supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, for its part, to be ready to take the American army against drug cartels in Mexico in service.
Obama's 2009 forbade the use of torture against suspected terrorists was also by the Kandidation Cain, Perry and Michele Bachmann.
It is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a foreign policy heavyweight.
The current presidential opponent, Reagan had also simple ideas and won despite the Cold War.
They call to mind the fact that Obama had to pay selbstein amateur and water in his wine, which was the subject of terrorism.
It is right to insist on the failure of his naive Zwiegespräches with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which he was also the reputation of the weakness.
This hostility is not quite so freely.
The population estimates the positive assessment of the National security under Obama, Bin Laden has switched off.
Since the Iraq Upholds before military intervention, which lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprised adequate, he argues that America needs to be rebuilt economically, in order to give his leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and the Western Europe directly links with Russia, was put into operation.
They should provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with pomp and ceremony.
Over 500 boardroom, including four leaders, attended last Tuesday on the Baltic coast under Orchesterbeschallung and gourmet buffet attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline linking Russia and Germany under the sea directly.
The German Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands symbolischerweise Russian gas tax Ventria's films together, which to the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline to 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas per year through a pipeline of 1,224 km, which connects the region St. Petersburg Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, supplied to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, amounting to a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - is allowed to be completed by the end of 2012.
And it can be referred to the possibility of building a third pipeline along the route.
For Gazprom, the timely and pinpoint completion of this enormous provide as a victory.
The project was controversial in Poland and the Baltic states.
The Nord Stream pipeline will make a direct gas supply to Germany, while avoiding any route, through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) in the country.
For this reason, these two countries are losing some of their power: it is now difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to contract access to western European markets.
Warsaw, most involved in the debate was not shied away from the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new Franco-German sowietischen pact" in connection to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in order to compare the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has won the endorsement of the Russian project an even greater security of supply.
But at the expense of starvation of European energy, because the project a rift between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In barely five years Russia has managed to bring his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries, the strong Gasverbrauche and their gas run out.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us to organic way," François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, by pointing out to what extent are the large gas contracts of political and economic side.
All this explains the broad smile in Lugmin number of Gazprom managers regarding the Gaszuleitung.
The construction of this pipeline is also a prominent technology.
The underwater pipeline consists of steel and concrete shelter to protect them from Schiffsankern.
It rests on the seabed at a depth of approximately 200 metres.
The building had to be avoided from the Second World War previous minefields.
"As hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," Jens Müller, spokesman for the society Nord Stream.
It had to be taken stronger measures to protect the flora and fauna.
The line is a long queue of metal, difficult as 242 Eiffel towers over the entire length is interrupted by nothing, either through valves, or maintenance stations.
A control platform was off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders have refrained from, as the Swedes have little eager, a Russian state company in a permanent way to match its coastal settle.
"In the event of an accident contract we Gasdurchlass in less than a minute," clarified Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak leaks in the pipeline and gas in the air.
In this case, the designers, however, than just unlikely, since it was estimated the sweat completion of a consistency of a leak per 100,000 years.
The government's monitoring of the gas pipeline will be guaranteed by an underwater robot will to external surveillance purposes by a sea, as well as a device that circulates in the pipeline.
It has the form of a cigar, attaches a metre diameter, will be introduced into the interior of the pipeline and moved by the pressure.
After three full days of moving through the pipeline at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device when it arrives very specific information about possible deformities of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to function for fifty years, without the slightest undergo repairs.
The Gaszirkulation will simply by pressure.
This is 200, 100 in cash to the access cash at the exit.
Five companies have united to achieve this project their forces.
The senior leadership, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Attached to the German companies e. ON and BASF attached (15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie group GDF Suez, the French companies (9%).
These five companies have formed a business community that Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
It is located in Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly good.
Gazprom has the entire capacity of their Gastransportes hired out then this society, and on renewable twenty year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity, no matter how big the real from transporting volume," clarified Jens Müller.
The financing of the pipeline construction was at 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should amount to EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, the investment, for example, 240 million.
The minority shareholders are sure to recoup their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The pipeline is a sandy, with pine forested coastal strip Lugmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 metre high valves are the Gasaustrittspforte.
Sensors measuring pressure, temperature and other indicators of the gas, arrive before transferring this in the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal with a million cubic metres of Russian gas verstreichende per hour.
At full capacity would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and $6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a trademark note book.
Created by an Italian company approximately fifteen years ago, would like to express Moleskine now the letter back new style.
It has a flair for adventure, by candlelight with the letter zugebrachte hours.
The Moleskine note book is again, with his black, rechteckigen cover, his rubber band, the eierschalfarbenen sides, as it has aged over time.
The Moleskine note book, as we know it today is, however, in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, decided to bring a distinguiertes design note book on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, technical adviser at the time of the company, is charged with market introduction of the new product.
The note book was a traditional production technology, called jetty start (mole skin), which described a Baumwollack, which will be used for salaries of padded benches.
This type of note book was asked by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has resurrected an old and almost forgotten subject again, until the 20th century was seen as an icon of would-be artists," said Maria Sebregondi, now brands responsible for Modo Modo.
The success comes.
Between 2006 and 2010 increased sales by 26% and establish a sales of 12.7 million.
This is a far cry from the usual production in the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were conceived.
Moleskine the Italian border, and in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to produce a phantom image of the buyer, since the notice book as businessmen as enthusiastic students and professionals.
Moleskine the image cosmopolitan, cultured and offengeistiger customers.
The small Italian companies, which had its beginnings in 12, and today employs over 100 employees and has since 2008 on two offices, one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookshops, Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutique in city centres and goes to assert its identity.
"We have followed the spirit and his new printing needs, despite the recovery of the e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand exposure called "Detour (a) " launched, in the architects and artists their own notebooks.
In August, the company at the film festival in Locarno also cover with leopard pattern on the market.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural spirit and showed it to diversify its products: pockets, diary, pen, computer boxes... The brand has the full range of articles.
A success, the begrudgers in the plan: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo by the investment fund bought SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and proposed a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled people to such a high level?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today marks the beginning of the 15th week of work for the disabled. "
Despite the purposeful Öffentlichkeitspolitik, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people always twice the average average: 19% to 9% of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No, stressed Éric Blanc Franchet, Director General of the Association of Adapt, the" week of work for disabled people ." "
"The within fifteen years are considerable."
"That was not the unemployment rate twice, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, there is still an enormous amount of work to do."
It must be said, however, that for disabled unemployed are still many obstacles remain before they get a job.
More often it is the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no A-levels and there are only 10,000 people among the 2.3 million students with higher levels of educational attainment.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% in the overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make a fresh start working, and the "form the core of the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, founded in 1992, the company is helping to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
The underlying implication that mentalities, certainly, but slowly.
A in April by IMS Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité study, which surveyed managers have "a weak level of disability," the "over-represented" "persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually well-off."
The result is that private companies with more than 20 people still have a long way to go to the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was enshrined in an Act of 1987.
The latter, which dates from 2008 figures point to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now about 3%," said Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organisation, which is tasked to collect contributions from companies that flout the law.
The proof: the number of "fees" zahlender plants, as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, and in number from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for increased contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies, said Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement is also a real awareness especially among the large firms groups."
According to the Ministry of Labor employ only 59% of the plants between 20 and 49 staff disabled workers, businesses with 100 to 199 employees compared to 82%.
Hazard: "What kind of happiness"
Even before the "Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45 p. m.), which had Eden hazard and Georges Leekens their pleasure, the Friendship game, not hide.
It would be too far to say that it has been a covert agreement between them, but the picture speaks volumes symbolic.
Side by side on the podium viewers of the Stade de France had George Leekens and Eden Hazard good peace contract.
Five months after the spirited gesture of his offensive player against Turkey had won the Belgian national coach reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with his progress, Eden and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I would like to look forward," assured the native Liller tendencies.
As the contrast between his presentation in club and nation Elf "It is an unit that justifies everything."
"I am in Lille throughout the year, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It is time for me to go to the launch."
Hazard will come after Saint Denis, Friday night against Romania on the Matchs against France, finally "to shine."
But without the flavor of the "pleasure ."
The French national team fires since the age of 7, he led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This will inevitably lead to the "unique" nature of this meeting to increase even more.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be present," he remembered.
"We are now on the road."
"To play against them means a great deal of luck!"
Leekens liess, with unparalleled "pride ."
"The pride of a gala match."
"Proud" and, in his capacity as "neighbours" - to confirm that France "has become a team at a very high level ," and there is little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Condemns Laurent Blanc has done a good job," he said.
Although Belgium is likely in the next European Championship, so the technicians are the plane with the blue (the French National Eleven) share... And direction Brazil in 2014.
"We are small Belgians are powerful," he said.
"We are one thing to plan, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"They will say that at the upcoming Games." in the game against France.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team by Paulo Bento provides for the return match against Bosnia with great optimism (22:00 p. m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
The Hinspiel had two teams lacked objectivity.
"At the end of this 90 minutes we will be a happy team and, above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento already faces in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not even the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selecçao," his National Eleven, for which he has since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
For Portugal, in fact only 90 minutes sanctuary.
But it is to play a match, abzuservieren and an opponent, and Bosnia.
In view of the Hinspiels (0 - 0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica it seems obvious that has not yet been decided.
Portugal dominated the game clear about more than a hour, but the team was not able to put the matter as important as it would have taken up the pressure.
"This is a good result, but it poses some risk, because we have made no Auswärtstor."
At home, however, in their bright erstrahlenden Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese, before an audience that will be as much of the game to get by, even if the game, of course, as a "very close" was announced, said the optimistic, but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but we are fully convinced that we can gain the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We have to continue to have a 50% chance in the championship in 2012," watered down, however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia is forcing the Portuguese to achieve a goal and to win.
A draw to the Bosnians, who also have a goal, already.
"This is a good result, but it poses some risk, because we have made no Auswärtstor" regrets Bento.
"We are up against a team that has high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica the Portuguese, already beginning to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "admit they have no time for reflection."
A good idea, provided that they will be implemented in practice.
