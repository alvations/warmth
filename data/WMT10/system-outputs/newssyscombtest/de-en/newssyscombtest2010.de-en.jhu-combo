Anyone who prefers saving and the quality of the stay in second place, which can try to wait a few days.
The Spindelmhle hotel owners now for the year Silvestertag mostly only weeks.
I think that they will try to sell them for a while, but then they must also give, and for shorter periods.
And then the free rooms room quickly Jandura estimated.
free beds in all winter dates is always, always the travel office Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet sold out.
In our offer is about half of the seats are still free.
That is why we have prepared some cheaper Christmas visits for the last moment, the director of the travel agents Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Silvestertag in Giant can offer the Vrchlabi - travel agency, but there are fewer free seats.
Good (also the first 14 days in February, the rest of the winter dates are sold on average.
This year is the interest for the winter were also negatively affected that in Giant. no snow.
The people are waiting to see whether snow falls.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
should the runways within a week verschneit, will also be sold out the Christmas, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and slightly better than last year, manages to fill the rooms in the hotel horizon in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On Silvestertag and at Christmas we only have a few free room.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February will also the business well, the director of the best Pec hotels, Karel Rada.
about 80 percent for the New Year's Eve is also the hotel in central Zentralparkplatz in Janske Lazne.
However, remains on Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne even half the beds.
Pleasantly surprised us in January this year, for which we are currently at around 60 occupied.
A bit weaker is now the February, but at the moment when the snow comes, is the interest in the periods spent in Giant, the director of the hotels Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
On a more snow Mess the Giant hotel owners now.
On Thursday, it should cool and if there is rainfall, should be the snow on the mountains.
But then again to a warming, informed Jiri jakubsky from the site of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove.
United States: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comical, with which Schlerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the President with his reputation of the brightest, the strategy of his predecessor in the issue of Afghanistan, which he himself even for the stupid.
When he finally his anxiously awaited ausschwitzte Afghanistan doctrine, it emerged that he abschrieb this on the kopierpapier from the Bush Iraq Szenariovor three years ago.
Not only that, in the text itself, he used the phrase "as in Iraq", he has even the name of the Bush statement in January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "new vorwrtsweg", without hesitation.
He has even three years ago, the Bush idea - fresh troop contributions in the troubled by the civil war to send - as "irresponsible and in their conclusions karastrophische decision".
Subsequent months showed that the recommendations of the military, Bush strategy is the only possible and was very successful in the that we are no longer today in the news about Iraq.
The Bush's reputation has not improved by, because he has his successor a much dankbarere starting situation, as it was to be expected.
in Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle repeatedly.
in order to increase the contingent have asked the military supreme commander, especially the of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, even despite the Subordinationsgewohnheiten zaudernden - criticized in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers in order to reverse the situation for the better.
The President has three months, but with no better idea and so he has betrayed the General wenistens about 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has the promise of another 5,000, even if he originally at least 10,000 expected.
highly problematic in the Obama strategy is its plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the increase in the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Also, despite the fratricidal war in recent years, the Iraqi society relatively well structured, their leaders to the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the indication - on no one can rely and there are no agreements.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, which are used to change every day their mind.
The political institutions, even if they were established formally correct, remain only buildings, behind which the patriarchal stammbeziehungen relations proliferate.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the confusion of the conditions that the Pakistan and Iran - influences even more.
The building of a "strong state", which is the minimalist objective of the whole operation is very unrealistic.
Time horizon of the Obama strategy surprised by his voluntarism
over the last eight years has, the situation in Afghanistan, and now it is on the verge of explosion.
To believe that the small soldiers in the war on the "early" broke out, create a miracle, can only a truly romantic soul, is not impressed by facts.
from the political point of view is the date for the withdrawal of irresponsibility, because the Taliban as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans to participate in the combat in Afghanistan, is running out.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want their constituents, in the security of Germany or Italy with the war in the Hindu Kush Gebirgsvorland.
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and not the increased sanctions on the Iranians, for the United States is a very serious question of whether do not to solve the problem with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America after Obama the winner withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation plaster for Barack Obama is the fact that three years left until the presidential election and therefore, there is still enough time, so that he can resort to a different strategy, this would prove to be a total loss.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs received no bonuses more in cash

The company announced that has responded to the sharp criticism of its pay practices.
A group of 30 top managers will instead of money stock shares, but only sell in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn the managers in the case if they act too risky.
Goldman Sachs is so according to the Reuters news agency at the forefront of efforts, the premium Wall Street with long - term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street on further direction is aware, in which it has to go, the former banker of the society, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs was the target of criticism after having for the first three quarters of this year, almost $17 billion for prmienboni bonuses.
The total amount of premiums bonuses in the course of this Jahra will probably also despite the today after the Reuters news agency reported to exceed $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector with the start of the financial crisis in a whole series of Lnders has become the hottest political issue.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to the bonuses of bankers, the 25,000, unique with a tax of 50 per cent.
similar steps are also preparing for France.

Minister is considering the resignation. Klaus has invited him in the Castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives the Finance Minister, Eduard Janota on Friday morning, about his continued presence in the government, because it with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form in which this has been released by the Assembly on Wednesday, does not agree.
It is thought that will be the budget and perhaps also the continued presence of Janota cabinet the issues of the Friday meeting.
The budget will also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which deepened the crisis in the public finances.
On the meeting of the presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
On its future remain in his post Janota on Monday with the prime minister, Jan Fischer, negotiate.
After the budget -, which now receives Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
In Parliament on Wednesday, but on the Left Party proposals on money and the money for the civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and direct wages of farmers.
The government has the proposals of the social democracy, that they increase the budget deficit.
between the left party, on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and legal party, on the other hand, is therefore a sharp domestic political dispute, dessentwegen the question mark over the future work of the fischer - cabinet, on which the ODS and CSSD and Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was approved by Parliament, the package of austerity measures practically liquidated by the fishermen - government in the autumn for their Understanding, and of the public debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but not, said today in the discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that the politicians the "serious problem" that "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances, have neglected for a long time.
In his view, there is no good solution.
An improvement could only bring a strong government, which still on a broader consensus among the political parties.
The ODS, Mirek Topolanek, that the budget is appalling, and the government should weigh their continued existence.
The ODS deputy chairman, Petr Necas, said the CTK that the concept of the cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
Premier Fischer described in the editorial similar words as a "strong Aussprche."
The CSSD leader, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek - words that the budget deficit is, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and exceeds 200 billion kronor.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was satisfied.
Mandela was in the new film by Clint Eastwood played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans say that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: the ungeschlagene" of the world much of the country from its fight and, despite some criticisms that was occupied the main role by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid system of government in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in his life history of the American actor Oscar - Morgan freeman,.
Freeman said that he was asked by the einundneunzigjhrigen Mandela, whether he could be in the Eastwood film.
A further important role Matt Damon.
I said to him: "If I play, I must take you.
The zweiundsiebzigjhrige - actor, the price for his role in the eastwood - drama from the boxbereich "million dollar baby" had received, already the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from the end of the slave owners, a fictional US president, and also in "Evan Allmchtig", but rarely someone who is still alive, and for many people is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was for his active work in the end of apartheid in the South African republic of 27 years in prison.
He was released in 1990 to undfr four years he was President of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "ungeschlagen", and at the same time, it is the name of a Gedichtes of the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was to speak as he
The film recounts a true story, the Nelson Mandela his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people after apartheid still rassenmig and economically divided.
He believes that he can reach people through sport, so he decides, the rugby players, the outsiders, to the world.
Finally, the South African team to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela - history on the cinema screen.
He had no other than to play this role so this as closely as possible to the reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak, as he.
The actor said, if he and the world leaders would be in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, to eat with him and in his speech to be behind the scenes.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela's hands.
I have that when I give you hand schttele, I accept your energy, they will be transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what they are, he said.
For me, it is important to become a different person.
Matt Damon is in the film Franois Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have prevailed.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he Pienaar met for the first time in his house.
I remember when I was the door bell rang that he opened and the first thing I said to Franois Pienaar in my life, was: 'in the film, I see much more'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with their actual role models, he has led the director Eastwood "Invictus: Ungeschlagen" received positive reviews and we are also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of The Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his assessment in the following words: "that was a very good story, very well ausgefhrter film."
in the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.

The Generalitt has diesesmal time and claims that it cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket fell not affected and the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases, were damaged the engines in the first stage.
Even if no test launch without error, the leadership of the ministry only six of 13 for unsuccessful.
The almost 50% success, the generals with optimism and will continue to claim that the "Bulava" will fly again without problems and even to ten - nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tonnes.

Czech discovery: a substance, also in like 'HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of improved substance is that he is also the viruses, which are resistant to drugs.
This fact against the disadvantage that the link to normal virus variants are not as strong as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured.
The patients, the drug combination but can prolong the lives and prevent the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
their income is accompanied by a whole series of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the virus reproduction also has the development sg. Resistentviren, against the medicines are more effective.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (Chemisch - technological university) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way, how to deal with - the virus.
They have proven that the substances on the protein known as Metalokarborane substance, which is responsible for the expansion of HIV viruses.
The Metalokarborane are links of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus - reproduction in other ways than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists to new improved links, which have been prepared on the basis of knowledge of the of their attachment to the viral protein.
The Metalokarborane have a unique three - dimensional structure: two vielfchige cages from Bor -, hydrogen and carbon atoms and through a metal atom, in this case, cobalt, are linked.
Heimtckisches and constant virus
HIV Protease is protein substance of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV caused by the HIV virus division would not mature Infektionsvirenpartikel.
If we eliminate the HIV Protease, we call the propagation of the virus in the body of the patients, the scientists in the press report, was by the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
in the work in the science newspaper Journal of Medicinal Chemistry was published, scientists describe whole ranks of the compounds, in which two couples of cages (see table) are linked by a brief organic chain, then systematically changed.
A weaker, but reliable
The impact of this series of substances against the HIV Protease wurdne in tested, against their steady (resistant) variants, which were won by HIV infected patients.
The impact of the metalokarborane in the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinically used medicines, but they do not lose their effect on the resistentvarianten, against which the medicines are often ineffective.
The unique effect mechanism and its other properties, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical impact, the Metalokarboranen to interesting links for further research, on the development of effective drugs against HIV says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the laboratory for structural biology of the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences. the Institute for
dispute over budget. ODS went to fishermen, the fights back
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, called the approved budget for next year as "terrifying" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, in his view, their continued existence.
The statement of the ODS described the prime minister as a "strong Aussprche".
It is time for the analysis.
The deputy ODS -, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the cabinet Beamtenkabinetts with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
After the Prime Minister Necas must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament, when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it be to remain in office through the Parliament left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed depart, Necas pointed out.
The House on Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, but with party - amendments on more than 12 billion kronor.
Parliament has the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has the proposals of the social democracy, that they increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should with a backlog of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, it is the desire of the government, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budget Frase not clear.
Frustration and futility
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has stated that the government of the current situation.
Necas is convinced that, if janota seriously with his resignation in the event that the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
According to the Czech television has Janota on Monday after the government business the premier.
He has indicated that he is to remain in office.
Reason is his disappointment on the Verhandugn of the budget.
To what extent for the fishermen fight with the budget deficit, so that, the Nominanten the Social Democrats (CSSD), in accordance with in the budget, the changes in the government to do nothing.
The Premier should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament adopts continue to deficit - steigernde laws, for example, sick pay and pensions or the service law should be changed.
Topolanek: by ODS nominated ministers were wrong not
That is a matter for the Prime Minister fishermen and the government.
The ODS nominated ministers have not made mistakes, Topolanek said in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function people who to top 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen in favour decides to give the fight against the level of deficit public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left - wing majority, which is currently in Parliament".
then he can count allegedly with the support and tolerance of the citizens on Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if it will be, then I will deal with it, said of the citizens of Democrats nominated Defense Minister Martin Bartak journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer flew in the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS came at the request of the Prime Minister back
at the Necas stressed same time that the ODS probably would vote in Parliament on Wednesday against the revised budget, if the premier members of the citizens Democrats explicitly ask that to allow the adoption of the budget.
We are not as orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party leader in Parliament and in the Czech Republic was not pushed back.
I have not noticed that my vote would be lacking.
As I have to the mandate, I knew that in coming months, in all, at Bolschewisierung of Parliament and destruction of all would be positive, Topolanek itself.

All regions have, but ultimately the long - term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three are and say attacking us that we take the cherries, we have the offer only on the size, as it was voted with them.
They claim that we are expensive as the Czech railways, because we would know the prices of the Czech railways, were completed last week.
So we have no other than to defend us.

Vaccination against Pneumokokken free of charge and voluntary
Imfung against Pneumokokken from January the usual.
It is a first for the families for free and voluntary.
But now voices that would be the - vaccination more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against Pneumokokken culminate.
The Institute already set the maximum price of vaccines, which to pay for health insurance.
The experts are also on the vaccination procedure in the clear.
New vaccination
vaccines free of charge for August - children
From January can be vaccinated against Pneumokokken free of charge, on 2 August last year and later were born.
The condition that they have not received vaccine dose.
Anyone who has begun with the vaccination in last year or earlier, must also pay weiterewiederholungsimpfung itself.
The first dose of vaccine should be between 3 and 5 5th month of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of the families against Pneumokokken vaccinate their children.
The parents paid 1,600 kroner and more for a dose.
for the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses required.
as a whole, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccination doses 300,000 to 450,000 kroner per year.
They save but in the treatment, would need the children without vaccination.
Until now, the state for all land vaccination of children spent around 500,000 per year.
The duty - vaccination was introduced with the so - called janota package.
Pneumokokken Mittelohrentzndung, but also cause serious infections including Gehirnhautentzndungen and blood poisoning.
By Pneumokokkeninfektionen Pneumokokkeninfektionen die after investigation in hospitals per year up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years.
Outside of the Czech Republic was the duty - vaccination of children against Pneumokokken in some 40 countries.
will the be mandatory?
at the same time, said that this vaccine could be in the future.
From January to paid by the insurance and be voluntary.
that the - vaccination would be better, for example, the head of the citizens association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association already in the long term for the Pneumokokken vaccination.
The experts at the international conference, was involved in our group, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have succeeded, at least.
I believe that this is the way we must go now, led.
The health change but not the vaccination procedure against Pneumokokken.
At this moment, we are considering not at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors.
The chairman of the society of practical Kinderrzten, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then it could be on the reduction of vaccination number "in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccine has launched a voluntary," says allerdingst cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80 percent of parents to their infants against Pneumokokken next year.
The vaccination against Pneumokokken is also, that this the first to vaccination is paid for by the health insurance and not by the state.
The insurance should spend the money for prevention, so save save for further treatment, erkrt Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This is a concern of the practical doctors, the purchase of vaccines.
After the initial the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and doctors receive this in the same, as well as other by the state to them vaccines.
Some members feared that the insurance so "the money from the health insurance could lead".
that the doctors buy the vaccines themselves and will have to wait until the insurance companies pay for them.
According to the estimates, to invest the individual practitioners 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant amount of money.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
Still they and we
Can Islam French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
at a time when the Swiss voters voted for a ban on building minarets and the is widespread concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, a thorough and thoughtful report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the avowedly skularisiertesten societies of Europe and be integrated.
Some readers will this new book from admiration for the last work of the author: "why the French No scarves love" (original title: "do n't like why the French Headscarves") (2006) read, an elegant and densely argumentierenden study of a contentious issue, the country which divided about one and a half decades and are employed and whose effects still visible.
Bowens neustes book offers a more comprehensive and khneres spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he would like to know not only what the politicians and the media about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, are now the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic free".
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students about the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should be lectured young Muslims about evolution and rights of homosexuals?
can marry a Muslim woman a non - muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim, to use a zinsorientiertes banking system in order to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profanen affairs, he claims, the daily life, in contrast to the political drama, the media.
The author acknowledges a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a familiar name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a - born Arab - Muslim scholars and academics.
This new generation trying to open the debate about how it is possible one hand, a good Muslim and on the a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are wary of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists, Bowen, with their Salafi usually divided counterparts supporters of the puristischen Sunni Islam, with Saudi Arabia in today a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen is of the opinion that could be Muslim values and French secularism compatible.
But a convention requires a give and take on both sides.
It is the French political decision - makers (and the intellectual elite, so passionate the separation of church and state) really to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may be a rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, which in turn had to make their historic compromise with the secular republicanism.
He sees a "tightening of the of values" as a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? after reading this book, one is tempted to say 'yes, but not yet ".
The bleak outlook of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice, which you, is melting at an alarming rate and living with that can survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, Schifffahrts - and fishing interests have in the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and Illustrator, is in "on thin ice" (original title: "on thin ice"), a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bears.
Bewandert in the complex history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of arktiserforscher, which have proved themselves in the hunt for the polar bears.
Admiral Nelsons encounter with a polar bears as a brave 14 - year - old Fhnrich sea, only with the rifle butt Muskete fought, is certainly a myth, but others are true.
Young bears, which were caught when they caught behind the bodies of their mothers, were recently killed in zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears in a vision.
Even today Zooanlagen still typically a of the life of a wild Alttiers. The climate is rarely appropriate: the Eisbr in Singapore was quite green of the algae that grow in the hollow hair of his skin.

Ironically, in the waters of the north of this two hunting nations the longest remain.

Marines were among the 6,000, the Arlington wreaths laid down
The obergefreite de 'Angello Robinson went seven hours by bus to lay a wreath at the grave of a soldier, he had never met.
For him and the other marines, the journey from camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, the national cemetery in Arlington, to order to decorate graves, was the day a tribute to the men and women, in whose footsteps they are.
In a few months, from where we are, we could be brought back, Robinson said on the fallen soldiers.
If we do, I would hope that someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning, placed wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington -.
Morrill Worcester, holder of the trauerkranzherstellers worcester wreath company in Harrington, Maine, founded in 1992 this tradition, as he and some others decided to dekorieren, several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18 year old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip each year, in various cities along the way to organise events, the people in the military and are paid to victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non - profit organization, wreaths across America (wreaths across America), has extended the event to other states.
this year more than 16,000 volunteers placed wreaths on the graves at the Arlington Cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, on graves of the national cemetery Fayetteville in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York and at the memory for the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 for the second time for purchase and transport of wreaths.
Charleen hunt, 70, said from Westminster that she has made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldiers.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, said Hunt, this is their way to give something back to the victims.
She said that this is a small contribution, as we can support our soldiers.
It is as if the visit of a family tomb.
wrapped in warmer clothes were the volunteers across the vast lawn and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers were older graves from the first and second world war and the Vietnam war as an objective, since they are not as often as the newer graves, the organisers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples in the hand, while the fresh pine branches on the grey of grave stones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red ribbon, the upper part was on.
The section 60, which is in the vicinity and where veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations gifts 1,000 placed wreaths, this section to, but the gloomy mood of the current wars met this area.
Some wept openly, others prayed and families and friends to each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names in stone, while others to small black and white place cards that had been set for those in the wet mud, whose tombstones were not yet completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who before the grave of her son bitter tears was crying.
It is 8 hours of Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marineinfranterie - Corporal David Shane Spicer, in July in the fight.
No one should ever forget why we are free... that my son has paid for, she said.
"If I am no longer, I would like to see someone reminded him."
The US government by Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban government has a contractor to the US government, notebook - mobile phones and computers sold in the country, arrested, said representatives of the Foreign Ministry on Saturday.
The contractor, which until now has not been identified, working for development alternative, Inc., with headquarters in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients, such as USAID, the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Konsularbeamte the interests of the United States in Havana to try to gain access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not yet been published, although after Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitors for almost everything, on the charge of "risk" can be arrested.
all so - called counter - revolutionary activities, the easy protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
anti - government graffiti and statements are regarded as a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing community - community, led by the popular reporter Yoani Snchez, who often describes how she and her husband by government representatives and attacked.
Snchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractors will probably increase the tension between the communist government of Castro brother in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had a "slow" approach had sought to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new US policy stresses that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban government concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and create more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and are legal in Cuba, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of government employees $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only since this year ordinary citizens the purchase of a mobile phone, they will be used for the sending of text messages, as would cost a 15 - mintiges telephone conversation a daily wage.
The Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors and some government agencies, such as universities, accessible.
Cubans who want to connect, often the government must notify their names.
Too many websites is restricted access.
in Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens in Cuba are in prison, behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesman for the US interests representation in Havana.
Berbena said she could give no further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that is legal in any other free society - the of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently a harsh report on the freedom in Cuba, with the title "new Castro, Cuba", an allusion to the investiture of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants were very often within a day, convicted and imprisoned.
He said that would likely be any solution politically and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries for more dialogue move closer together.
Pakistani government officials plan to to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at five men from Northern Virginia to send to Afghanistan in order to kill US soldiers, and said that they hope this case could help to uncover a vast network of terrorist recruitment agencies, the Internet after radicalised young men.
Investigators said that they a opaque insurgents, known as Saifullah, had sought, the men had been invited to Pakistan after he had made, because one of them on the Internet video site YouTube favourable comments to terrorist attacks.
Saifullah after their arrival in Pakistan, the leaders of these men and tried to help them to reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who was briefed on the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not persuade the al-Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held on days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far removed from the inhospitable mountains in the north, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government officials, who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government officials said that the men were not discouraged and continue to the right to get in order to gain access to the Al Qaeda camps, when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of five men - which are in Pakistan and will be interviewed by the FBI - underlines the vital role of anwerber in the identification of future terrorists and possibly even more important, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US secret service a matter of the utmost urgency, human asset within Al Qaeda.
The Anwerber organisation act as guardians of the organization, those whose commitment to the holy war is not seriously enough and those that might be spies.
American would - be recruits a Qaeda a special examination, said analysts.
because of their potential access to US objectives and its propaganda value also as hugely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the analyst of the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that terrorist groups in recent years much more cautious about whom they allow access, because the US intelligence have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to anyone in these groups, what better way could go, as the recruitment model to follow which so many have followed?, Kohlmann said.
The model is based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators are calling in Copenhagen climate "action"
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded by the negotiators in Bella conference centre of the city khneres action on climate change.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while the police estimates of around 25,000.
The event passed off relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists small devices in the vicinity of some government buildings in the inner city zndete.
On a day when the by the UN climate talks little happened, thousands of activists with banners in English, "through the city, which there is no planet B" and one in Spanish, which declared "the Earth says" enough ".
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the Fotografin Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the country of their mother, her mind with the heart - breaking problems the country because of the already significant effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I have decided to participate in the large demonstration - to the floor and appeal to the world leaders, a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around the question.
The police kept the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Centre and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either mitfhrten or pocket knife.
According to Danish law, are banned these actions during demonstrations.
According to a viewer, who did not want to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, anonymous demonstrators in black clothes several explosive devices in the vicinity of the Copenhagen main channel, near where several ministries.
They threw it in the vicinity of the building, he said and added that it began as a, but then followed by "a few large explosions".
the inside of the Congress Centre the people on television screens to whole afternoon the demonstration.
But the protest has the awareness of the main officials, such as Su as China's chief climate negotiator, apparently not.
When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration would have a positive impact on the international considerations, he replied in English: "this is something of which I was not even aware."
He then in Mandarin and said: "because of the venue is great, I cannot hear what is happening out there."
He stated that from the perspective of the individual, whether the demonstration would help or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "we can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent racial divide
The certificates to mathematics performance last week was welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the District of Washington still far behind the schools in the country, the maximum benefits, the evidence show that the viert - and Achtklssler faster progress than cities in the last two years,, Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made.
But in the latest figures from the national assessment of educational progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is included, is the persistent performance gap between African American and white pupils, both at local and national level.
The average score of white Viertklssler from Washington D. C. rose by 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a scale of 500), its african - american peers, but only three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap rose in reality, between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the african - american achtklssler remained basically the same, he fell a statistically significant point of 245 to 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data, because the sample size was not big enough.
The picture is not encouraging over a six - year period.
The gap, the white and black Viertklssler separated in 2003, when the first NAEP was covered in this district, 60 skalenpunkte (262 to 202).
And although the item number the children of both groups, grown in that time, has now reduced the difference with 58 points.
Some education advocates of the district last week expressed its concern that the results of the school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were, for the most part of white pupils, who are already strong children.
This suggests that we have the overall assessment by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of the board of D.C. voice, a nonprofit group that for the educational equality in Washington D. C..
I do not for a span of two or three points and, said the democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, a daughter in the fourth class of Eaton primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said the message of the study is that the the city secondary schools need urgent attention.
of course, we would always see the positive signs, I respect.
What frightens me, however, is that we do not close to the time and energy that we use for our school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the current weak pupils.
This autumn, for example, some teachers will be trained, a new reading curriculum the wilson - reading system to use at pupils in the upper classes of elementary school and middle school, the basic skills of reading have not at the beginning of their school career and the significantly behind their mastered counterparts classmates.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum, from kindergarten to sixth class the games and real life experience, was under the former chief schools inspector Clifford Janey to Washington and this curriculum, some of the NAEP progress, which were reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to the best measures the pupils to benefit below the central level, said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and will continue the extra money and resources for the weak schools, which are necessary in order to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, the urban audit results.
The conventional remedy is, its resources and management reforms at the schools, which are in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could create political fallout, work against this important agenda item.
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors that they tried to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We must strengthen our schools in the districts, so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who is now school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements of closing the achievement gap is in Washington, the traditional public school year, which currently 180 days, to extend in order to compete with the charter schools.
We must increase the school year to nearly 200 days in order to have the power to change, said Janey, who came with his teachers' union last year to reach agreement on 185 days per year, which he called "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next Treaty.
Higher education for more people than a future
The coach reached the Gettysburg - college with a loud pipes.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, from and blinzelt a moment at the sight of the white pillars, brick Ziegelsteinfassaden and smaragdgrnen lawn.
Gracielas parents have the high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, had also Graciela, in silver Spring was recovered and now lives in Riverdale, never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and the other Achtklssler the group, the Gettysburg, where the teaching costs 38.690 dollars per year, was more a ehrfurchtsvollen visitor, than an enthusiastic future students.
"Yes, I will soon be here!" called Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the leaders announced that they had entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" said they thought, as the low professor - to - student ratio of the school.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7, visited the children on their three - day tour and now they have the intended message included: the question is not whether it's College.
The question is where.
on the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States hispanischer immigrants, the high school end or as a pregnant teenager, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands, which received the college education, is needed in the middle class.
In truth, one of five of these "second generation" of the college which is a remarkable achievement, because many of their parents, mostly from Mexico and Central America, in the United States, without the high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers, because it for a generation, which will play a huge role in the labor force in the country, show the way forward.
Those who study powerful children, say, they often have a natural affinity for the school and its inherent them to success.
Many of them also have parents who give their children high and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But advisory programmes also play a major role by Graciela and millions of children as they help to in college, especially if these efforts over a longer period of time.
If you look at low - income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them in the wegsuche through the system, will be a single measure at any time not solve the problem, said Patricia Gndara, researcher at the University of California at Davis, the who hispanoamerikanische students.
We have to, for these children a supporting network of pre - school up through the high school.

US firms were in some cases, because competitors, particularly the Chinese and other state - controlled energy company, have significantly lower labor costs and more risks, because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies, have to conclude the contracts with the ministry.
Major U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which with the Iraqi oil ministry close relations and in recent years with technical advice, are empty.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state - owned China National Petroleum Corporation has for more contracts than any other companies and with large packages of contracts for two major fields go home.
We all know, the spokesman for the lministeriums, Assam Jihad that China is on the way, one of the big of the world economy and to be a technology.
We are convinced that the Chinese company with its Mitbietern and will meet its commitments to Iraq.

US Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must reckon with additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, because he has not in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a 7 - day tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, are no good options, he said in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such a development.
"one of the things that on the soul, is, if we in the last six years have learned something from Iraq, the war own unvorhersagbarkeit."
The Obama administration prefers a sanctions package, aimed at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that could also some sanctions affect the average Iranians.
He said that a "package of positive and negative" is necessary "in order to convince the Iranian government that it is in reality, less protected with nuclear weapons," because "their people will suffer terribly" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesman for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American government, the European leaders in the warning that Iran must reckon with "credible" consequences, if he with its nuclear program to the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to be that the knowledge of nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said that he would resume the talks to curb its nuclear program and a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for much - needed would nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has pushed for this type of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to win time for negotiations.
Iran, but since that time to leave the negotiations on the interim agreement -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
Iran the international community in relation to some of the proposals, which they had already agreed in early October, simply, has, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, brought together in a way, as did in conjunction with important additional sanctions on Iran were never, Gates said.
President Obama has set as a deadline 31 dez. for Iran to respond to these proposals before he other options, including the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "crippling sanctions" will continue.
In a statement issued in New York has condemned the Iranian representative at the United Nations, which it on Thursday "gratuitous and unfounded allegations" of some members security council called on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are ready to continue, talks with the United States and five other world powers "in order to achieve an appropriate long - term solution".
Gates, who last Friday should return to Washington, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning, before it in the oil - rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and representatives Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular in relation to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to prevent delays the US plans to reduce the American troop strength by the end of August of at to 50,000.
Gates also sought to the Kurdish concern about the imminent withdrawal of troops. US Representative quoted Gates, Masood Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, said: "we will your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
A change of direction in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband surrounded by propaganda posters on grew felt that "mother earth is too tired to talk other children" and "a baby means more grave."
These lessons have learned that, as well as government officials in Shanghai, by the low birth rate and ageing population in this summer, suddenly began to change course and young couples, more than to have a child, her response was immediate and definitive: "in no case".
We already have all of our time and energy invested in a child.
For a second child is nothing left, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8 - month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one - child policy in China, the two generations of notoriously dicklichen, spoiled Einzelkindern, are affectionately called "little emperors", has produced, a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate is at 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 at the time, as this policy came into force, the UN
Department for population issues, while the number of the population of 60 years and older in 2020 from 16.7 percent of the population by the year 2050 to, 1% rise exponentially. This is well above the global average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is in rich coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai, stronger.
Last year, 60 years old children and elderly almost 22 percent of residents reported Shanghai, while the birth - of one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai city population and family planning Commission said that couples receive normal reproductive age babies, "in order to help to reduce the proportion of the ageing population and to alleviate the labour shortage in the future".
Shanghai will soon "as old -- but not so rich such as the industrialised countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual easing
Enshrined in the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one - child policy would be the most controversial, which was introduced by the ruling Communist Party until today.
Couples who are against this policy, must reckon with huge fines -- up on her annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese officials have attributed to this policy that the critical demands on the natural resources could be avoided, while human rights activists have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials pregnant women who have already had a child, forced to abzutreiben.
Many couples had have - selective abortions, which an unnatural high ratio of men to women.
in recent years, government representatives for population gradually their position on the one - child policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been einzelkinder -- and 2007 was the tone of many hard slogans.
Qiao Chun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government officials have recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, to allow couples to two children, which is one partner einzelkind.
Shanghai in July was the first Chinese city, which has launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters, belehrten, to have only a child, have been replaced almost overnight by directives, which describe in detail, who qualify for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city government has sent municipal employees and volunteers for family planning, to couples at home and information sheets under the doors.
They also asked, psychological and financial advice for the available, which have more than one child.
The response was not encouraging, said family planning officials.
Disappointing response
Although officials from a rural town in the external areas of Shanghai, said that a recovery in the applications from couples is to see after the launch of the campaign for a second child, the urban districts reported no change.
in the municipality huinan with a population of, as an example still only four or five requests per month.
disappointed Shanghai officials say that the expected number of births in the city for 2010 despite the campaign still around 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of family planning committee of the Shanghai municipal Caolu, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give her first best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juan Juan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and this is legally allowed.
But they have, how many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance from the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West assess the one - child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer, whose wife seven months pregnant with her first child.
Yes, it is robbing us the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples be psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, the personnel chief, said she would like to only a child, because she was also a Einzelkind. "we were the focus of the family and that everyone about us.
We are not accustomed to care for others and do not really want this. "
Chen Zijian, a 42 year - old, a translation company, said it plain.
For parents from the middle class with dual career, which the birth rate is falling, he said, it is to be successful and we must be selfish.
The age group of 20 to 39 - year - old grew so that their parents during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment to see and they want a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, is huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must abandon their social life for at least two years.
Then there is the question -- "we must rebuild his home" -- and the life planning -- "if the child is 9 months old, we already have a CV for the best nursery schools."
Most of his friends are ready, this is a time, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to has achieved a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want too many victims.
UN group plan to reduce emissions
The by wild posturing and mutual accusations was sponsored by the UN climate conference, which until now has set on Friday with the publication of a document, a priority for the next 40 years recording an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases, with the industrialized nations in the near future to shoulder the greatest burden.
The text, which is the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases could provide, has both the remaining obstacles, as well as the way forward.
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation, the time next week, more than 100 leaders from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was created by a specially created UN working group is silent on the amount of money, should give the rich countries to poor countries, so that they can meet the short - and long - term global warming.
He also offers a range of options for the key issues, including how industry and major emerging countries limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global rise in should be, the political decision - makers.
The process will be given a great flexibility, John Coequyt, a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, the six -, has drafted document a 180 - page negotiating text, in order to focus on what the leading climate change representatives of, Yvo de Boer, the UN described as "the big picture".
It shows the outline of a possible agreement, in which the industrial nations together their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent, compared with the levels of 1990, while major developing countries to reduce their emissions in the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 2050. 50 to 95 percent.
The talks on Friday, the European community has given a boost by their assurance, over the next three years, 3.6 billion per year in order to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from the masters of floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
The Friday expressed the same verbal fireworks, what the talks in the last week.
The U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern has rejected, binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, demand, if not are financed by the industrialized nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration a tougher line with China, as a representative of the Bush administration, not even two years ago.
The United States will sign an agreement, without major emerging countries stand up and take action, Stern, who also lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave its opinion an hour after the declaration of the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, meant that the leading US climate negotiator either "common sense" or "highly irresponsible" of him was that he said earlier this week that the United States would help China not help to tackle global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of the world major powers is at stake, both within the industrial nations, as well as between the industrialized nations and emerging countries fault lines.
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to save the planet, with China and the United States because of their respective commitments, while poorer countries argue that the two dozen influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers to fight about who should bear the costs of the Bremsung of greenhouse gas emissions, because even affected countries have begun to act more aggressive, the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions to account for their actions.
It is clear that this is a game, which will develop a new economic domination, Ulate, who as a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are most exposed to the effects of climate change, said that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members on a 24 page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur runge - metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states "political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now united and measures of the emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues before the arrival of the government leaders need to be resolved to reach an agreement.
Senior representatives, such as the Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister entstiegen their aircraft and breaks through the corridors of the Bella centres meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, claims to be negotiated during the next week.
The sheer scale of the Assembly -- 13,000 people, daily in the centre and, gitarrespielende activists hold late - night shows in which they are fun of the countries which they feel betrayed and sell, and draft Treaty passed from hand to hand rather than by e - mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just: almost all important ministers are here now and will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of the organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights.
Britain's first 225 km / h faster train defined the Monday feeling new
Monday morning at 5 p.m. 13 will penetrate a pipe the darkness, to announce a zugabfahrt, which represents a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first high - speed in the country in his lightning trip from Ashfort, Kent, to London St Pancras 225 km / h and 93 km in 38 minutes.
With Lord Adonis, the transport minister, will then lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin - commuter services from London.
He hopes that the new service Britain finally to an international rail network faster, more reliable trains and the major urban areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could be commuter towns, Arbeitsanfahrtszeiten would radically reduced and the change of plane and car to train the national carbon emissions and reduce congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main parties in this vision.
But the many billion British pounds, which are necessary for the construction of a new national network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage in the British high speed could still the brakes.
High speed two (hs2), a company based in January, the government should present a feasibility study, Lord Adonis, according to the Times report on 30 December.
This gives it a detailed route map of the next stage of the high speed rail network.
The new railway line, linking London with the West Midlands, will with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places where the effects on the environment are controversial.
The free site is the plan the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final stretch.
HS2 also three options for a larger, northwards high - speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a Y - frmige route, in which a single high - speed link in the West Midlands.
The route would share in or near Birmingham and a Abzweig would west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in the direction of North East after Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"it seems to be the most viable option," said a railway insider.
After the completion of the journey time between London and Edinburgh to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part of the route, would not be opened before 2025, would allow the travellers, the London - Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour to go.
The proposals would offer the opportunity, with a speed of 400 km / h to, which the British rail network the quickest of Europe.
The first route was planned that 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can travel.
Up to 18 trains per hour on the in london - birmingham operation.
This in turn would mean that would be a terminus in London could be necessary on the 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the space limitations in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be extended to include the high - speed network.
Rail experts say that only St pancras international or euston this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan in his opinion, should be continued, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken until after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network to be built in sections.
The trains, first from the high - speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would be the travel time between London and Scotland in about three hours.
This is a key sticking point, so that a switch from air to rail can be, a beacon for the rail revolution.

Equally, however, the 15 criminal court ordered a medical examination of the 87 - year - old Liliane beds, which be carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and Hauptaktionrin of l'oral has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially among the, during the investigation of the prosecutor of Nanterre's conditions.
On Friday appointed doctors are a report before 10 March 2010, in which you clearly indicate whether and at what times Liliane beds Court may have found in a state of weakness.
I think they will undergo these investigations.
I will speak with her, the lawyer of Mrs beds, me Georges kiejman, after the hearing.
What the lawyer of Franoise beds meyers, me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...). The report will show that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady, which must be protected, he reiterated.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane beds, a criminal complaint against franois - marie banier, photographer and Allroundknstler, and accused him, to have exploited the weakness of their mother for years to total grants totalling one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For its part, to have Liliane beds had always been refuted by the photographers, which it sees as a longtime friend.
Although the court the admissibility of Mrs Court - Meyers the action would have to, the Plaidoyers of lawyers on Friday led to a large family debacle.
So, the lawyer of Liliane beds on three of his Klientin their letters sent letters (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that the husband of Franoise court - Meyers.
According to her lawyer Liliane Court the following: "could you please explain to my daughter that I for years, or twice a day to Banier wrote.
Franoise I have since their marriage can more ".
The public prosecutor Office of Nanterre is once again of the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to respond, especially because has rejected a guardianship judge in recent days their request to launch a judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane beds "is fully capable of, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act on their behalf, "the representative of the prosecutor, Marie Christine Daubigney.
The court has now determined to deliver a verdict after the trial on the admissibility of Mme court Meyers has taken place.
Manager revolution or the end of the strategic early education?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the major French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence in vain...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to his staff, said the position of the company vis vis consumers from the marketing revolution: it is to join the staff "values" determines the best, as it was earlier on the consumer - products of the technicians in the station to impose.
By the customers in the heart of the company has the marketing revolution the strategies of the conquest of the markets in place... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors preferences of customers to impose regularly again!
A demobilisation of staff can lead to a fatal demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon, in particular the employees.
These demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of R Eund, what is even more importantly, to those of economic intelligence.
In fact urges the IU (intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "by all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward - looking vision"; it claims by the staff a deployment, which the instructions of the authoritarian management.
We therefore call for a revolution, which would be the staff in of the concerns of the company equal to the customers.
The very related benefits of internal polls
The internal polls, as the questionnaire, the Orange his wage recipients, this revolution in relation to the management practice?
I fear that, unfortunately, not.
- First, because I could see that the whole structure with a new situation after many domains, finally, to do... what it has always done.
Also because the authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power in proportion to the importance of his own failures.
And finally, because most leaders have a much simplified notion of human behavior.
emerged from the great engineering schools is their interpretation of psychology mechanistic.
They play by intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory, which recently by the US "neuroscience" reactivated and unknowingly far - reaching research institutes and through the media.
Thus, and it suggests that it is possible to "leverage" (sic) to the involvement of employees, a aktuellein Le Figaro. FR poll by ipsos executives in a position to a mechanistic control system, which is unsuitable for today's world.
The mobilisation factors identify and measure
Instead, a for the smooth functioning of the modern companies necessary occupational revolution the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It is, in any consideration or practice of management to integrate a fundamental minutes: for the wage earners is the commitment to the company will only be possible if it is clearly as a means to achieve a part of their dreams, their ambition and their projects.
Now take only the studies from the multifunctional analysis of this idea of the motivation of the staff.
These studies have shown that their companies on the basis of a set Doxa judge them by their perceived image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of these factors can the executives of the companies' social performance "," predict and anticipate and their human resource management back to the right place.
So they create a fertile ground for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the "just war" Obama praise from the right one
The American rights on Friday by Barack Obama on the eve speech in Oslo and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 the concept of "just war" has defended against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, the awarding of the prize to Obama had mocked on 9 October, applauded this time the speech by the President, the example of the former presidential candidate in the elections of 2008 Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin said, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today and added that they themselves the subject of a "necessary" war in recently published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last of which I think that the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We must stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, the has inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has worked on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of violence; a way to explain his Entscheidungvon nine days ago to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, took the view that the prsdent have in Oslo "very good job" done.
I found that the speech was really very good, frohlockte the former President of the House of Representatives, particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama's.
In some parts of habeich this speech perceived as historic, Ginrich said in the radio show "The take" been questioned.
The member of, by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said he was pleased to have seen a "president of the left", the members of the Nobel Committee noted that they were "not free and not a price for peace, if the use of force would not exist".
For Michael Gerson, a former scribe of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has "a very American speech".
In addition, that he is as "Kosmopolit", as he always does, "he said," as an American president, "as he pointed out that the Europeans" as in a security bubble, which they do not have and for their protection they do not much, "Gerson.
Among the few, not convinced rights called the former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a hawk in the Bush era, the speech on the the National Review Online website of as "boring, pompous and inspirationslos."
To the left of the President of the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich worried about how Barack Obama defended the recourse to the armed forces.
wrapped the war under the guise of the judiciary, the massacre of the innocents, quite simply, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, remains on the side of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still of the opinion that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama, called the speech itself for a speaker like him, who is known for his talent, "monumental".
The speech in Oslo "offers a plan for the management of international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama "the necessary discourse" and his speech as "bleak and exemplary" at the same time.

The signature of the TLF allows that the agreement for the first of this organisation affiliated companies, and then in the event of an extension by the Minister for the entire profession.
This will be the case "in a very short period of time",, Bussereau.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the process.
The federation FNTR denounced a "fraudulent trade", because the 100 million euro "were the sector to offset some of the carbon tax has already been promised".
The secretary of state for transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but to avoid disgruntling the bird - esser to the approaching Christmas days, laments the Unostra.
For the association Otre threatens the agreement "small and medium - sized companies in the sector over the next 12 months, a great grave."

Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the supporters of the project is purely and simply "the new heart of Europe".
Right. S21 is much more than the deeper of a railway station, more than a gigantic construction project, which the City of baden - wrttemberg capital for a decade in utter chaos.
Stuttgart 21 is from the spirit of the 1980's.
Head stations with tracks, right in the middle of the city, were at that time as transport technical fossils of the 19th century, the as a modern rail transport, as it took a lot of time, locomotives from behind.
, brief, drive - to go further.
and that is why the head should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a station, about half - way through the trans - European rail route between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - so the slogan of "heart of Europe".
S21 will now actually addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with the reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realised that it is in the hessischen and the Bavarian city almost impossible to implement the erlegen.
Head stations have no import and exit problem more, however, are modern trains with locomotives and tax cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 and the ice - new after Ulm is now being addressed.
Regional and local politicians have it.
The train power with, because the risks of the largest infrastructure - einzelprojekts the Republic of taxpayers and not the state company.
Stdtebaulich the project is still reasonably justified.
It creates new, which - according to the computer graphics of the planners - with a lot of green.
for the transport system is rail is harmful.
The transit station and the routes expansion are intended for the transport, which one - huge growth - 1980s.
at that time, there was not the competition from low - cost.
modern transport policy, but it must first be to strengthen the freight transport, because the transport by rail is much cleaner than by lorries on the roads.
But the new route because of intense climbs not for freight trains.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
Good six billion euros in schwbischen are buried.
That is the official number.
Experts believe that ten to 15 billion for realistic.
It is, in the next decade will the money to other hubs and engstellen in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the transport ministry.
One of the most important is the development of the 180 - route through the valley.
Since 1987, being built on the route in slow motion.
an urgently needed, right here on the tube.
But S21 will act as a brake.
The rheintalstrecke route is the bottle bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.

With the argument, Brender had lost the news of the ZDF in ratings, he rejected a another term of the highly regarded journalist.

Finally, even 35 staatsrechtler interfered in the debate, the chefs as unconstitutional.
Nothing came of it.
The person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, education and Romanistik.

Koch's adversary in the past board, the - pflzische Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week, the countries should the ZDF - state treaty change so that staff of the Intendanten cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
An excerpt of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of ZDF Beck, however.

Thanks to this Belegs journalistic independence was both Schchter without loss of face for the post of chief nominate and elect the board, without the suspicion, a into office.
In the party arithmetic Frey is already the left - wing liberals.

I am, Sllner, "anyone who is against attempts to intimidate the Securitate not enough."
The lyricist Werner sllner is Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize honours for Herta Mller and their unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule the literary scene and, in particular, the Community of the German authors a case from Romania shaken by, the abyss and the evil of a political system, which is based on monitoring and spying.
Werner Sllner is, so far, after bisherigem knowledge can say, not only the perpetrators, but also victims.
In his Securitate acts in Walter have played a role, said after the confession Sllners literary scholar Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of the Walter.
He had it in all for him at the time sensitive points "," Markel.
It is a moral need to make this point.
Sllners statement was in the form and unexpected, before this audience, is the commitment of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service, however.
Germany is a cosy reserve for Securitate -, Herta Mller had already written in July in the time after they had their own acts, 914 pages, read.
The people, we must presume, and in some case, what clear name behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and even Walter may also have.
Unlike the here now very verfahrenssicheren sighting of the Stasi files dealing with the legacy of the Securitate monitoring still very vague.
A systematic education is and has been hampered in recent years.
The Birthler with National Council for processing the Securitate files (CNSAS) was set up in 1999, the publication of the files since then has been, but rather slow.
Only since 2005, there is a law that regulates the management of the files.
The influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very high, came after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Mller an interview, in which a former Securitate, head of Temesvar dismissive about the prize.
They have a psychosis, finally, interrogated only once.
The infamy of power said quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly to the case Sllner, as so often in connection with sneak guilt, inevitable questions.
Why only now? who was hurt? the measured response of the Zuhrenden Sllners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter of knowledge rather than will be determined by apportioning blame and shame.
The Genese of Herta Mller, who has received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Sttigungsbeilage Champions League
It felt as if just a smart gekleideter Auendienstler of a very nice Christmas party, had distributed a sporting goods manufacturers goodies, as the new VfB - coach Christian Gross in the company of an orange plastic bag of Ausrsters a quarter of an hour after midnight in a herbeigerufene c - class.
The man with the enormous Glatze was because of him foreign city.
Otherwise, he would have been able to drive - alcohol was not in the game, and besoffen luck was the 55 - - as more.
This was a pleasant evening, but the work is continuing.
Or just right.
In the words of the first three days earlier: "We have reached the final", namely in the Champions League, thanks to the - success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: it is a brutally tough fight against the decline."
The "much more important task" on Sunday.
Then, is in Mainz to repeat the - class performance in the league - daily.
And the once again revealed weaknesses in the rapid three gates by Marica (5), Trsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Lots
The eighth final of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16 / 17 + 24 February / re 9 / 10 + 17 March) on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the fulminanten commencement of Babbel - successor was so.
not only the supposed saviours, of the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time self - confidence, given dedication and game.
I am on the players and told them that they should go their strengths, and have encouraged said to be brave souls plumber Gross in the simple sounding recipe for success, under Therapeut Babbel but had had any effect.
He has a certain magic, Babbel - Jens Lehmann, "if a new impetus, sometimes things happen in football, which would not have thought possible."
and Sami Khedira, after weeks of injury break thanks to its dynamic equal to the best players on the place, tried the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh air" and the operation of the new superiors to: "He is a man of action and discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel had it been lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet out of the woods, warns sports sport Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs but above all.
As Gross, players and managers, the victory against a weakened and completely swamped defense of the Romanian guests.
They have also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at: 4 the evil awakening, Khedira.
and sport Horst Heldt reminded that a season goal has been achieved, but other is still far off.
We are not yet on the mountain.
after celebrating was that Heldt on his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory since three months, was due to the events of the weekend, in the form of a television interviews before the game broadcast of gate - keepers Jens Lehmann fresh.
There are decisions that countered the other and not the Jens, Heldt the harsh criticism.
The had accused of the board leadership weakness and shown to change coach to pressure pubertierender fans have.
Also that his free day after games had been withdrawn, Lehmann Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy.
Lehmanns statements were "characterised by pure selfishness," keilte back and announced consequences for the final man.
They will probably no friends for life, the two forty.
But they were after all, with all other agree that would not have been without the preparatory work by the abgelste coach team teaching and vindictive, strong idea possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a big share of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann voices - and also the man with the plastic bag.

Case Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group chief Jrgen Trittin, Defense Minister Guttenberg because of false information to Kunduz affair as a liar.
The Social Democrats and Left demand information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - Following the recent findings on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition defence minister karl - theodor zu guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception.
The minister said the deadly bombing of two fuel lorry in September "knowingly the falsehood", said Green group leader Jrgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD - news programme "".
It is called the landlufig: he lied.
The order to kill was in disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report, the NATO, Mr Guttenberg had read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack not only a destruction of abducted vices, but also to kill two Taliban leaders.
In the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein requested US air - have been killed or injured, according to NATO report up to 142 people.
Green, the Social Democrats and Left on Saturday called German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy, and whether Chancellor, German army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jrgen Trittin and - Renate Knast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.

Dream worlds
Some people see in wachem state images and hear voices, see or hear others do not.
not only in mental health and drug binge blurs the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
As long as it is in their sleep, everything is in order.
If we are with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we must likes the wildest ideas and imagination.
Anyone who witnessed in the wachsein traumartige conditions, things that others do not see or hear, see and, in the modern Western world mostly as crazy or drug, at least as a sonderling.
But such images and voices arise not only in mental health or drug binge.
Blame our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or to write novels, sometimes to ensure that the boundaries between dream, madness and reality.
Traumartig modified wachbewusstseinszustnde can occur in many different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case of.
Even if may differ cause and effect, the visions of the Mystikerin Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of New Age - prophet Carlos Castaneda, schamanische Entrckungszustnde, psychosis and hallucinations but similar processes.
hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the neural messenger substances of the brain - especially dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline, Acetylcholin - is disrupted and the interaction of various parts of the brain.
Complex hallucinations and wahnhafte thoughts are very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The force has no power over him
The context of madness and dream, philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle concept hallucinations as a form of the dream in the state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, 1861 noted a "great similarity of misleading one with dream", Sigmund Freud the dream was "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, wahnbildungen, false perceptions of such a".
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. turned into a figure.
His body is two dimensional and quietschbunt.
The gravity has no power more over him, he is hanging in the bedroom ceiling.
He senses a kick.
Behind him vicious Teufelsgestalten with red, distorted fratzen, zhnefletschend.
They hunt him, him with serious, inflammatory boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain of the whole body.
Noisy, malicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer, the voices to attack and insult him.
Henning T. snaps two cable from the stereo, knotet a in a noose and consolidating them hole in the ceiling.
He is rising on a loudspeaker and tightening the noose around the neck.
one.
The noose itself.
This should be a lesson to you, the voices in trommelfellzerfetzendem chorus, "walk in the clinic and let you cure!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has six acute psychosis, the last 2 years ago, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive - paranoid psychosis, moreover, he is bi - low, he takes medication, against depression, mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
in the of I have seen worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The images are cruel reality
About one percent of the population at least once in a life with schizophrenia, in psychiatric hospitals is treated it as the second most common illness after the depression.
in an schizophrenic acute psychosis affected mostly can no longer distinguish between internal and external world, they are in a state of can lead to hallucinations, sizes, relationships or paranoia.
Particularly is the widespread voices -, the orders, or or dialogisieren.
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person is not important to separate what is trivial, the brain can no longer ausfiltern disturbing signals the awareness is awash with impressions.
As the dream also opens the psychosis the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies, the deeper awareness classes.
The reality of perception in the psychosis is subjektzentriert, says Professor Thomas Fox, of the clinic for general psychiatry in the Universittsklinikum Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic itself in the middle of it, everything has a importance to him.
at the same time he in a passive role, he will, like in the dream, overwhelmed by the events and they can make.
schizophrenic feel often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality reality is not possible, the images are cruel reality, wake up.
Once in life experienced a hallucinations to have
Unlike in the dream, says Fox, "but the sinnliche and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in the psychosis, basically."
The obsessive thoughts and hallucinations based in reality, the alienation of the Erlebens will take place in real terms.
Why exactly our brains antics, researchers still puzzle.
Exceptional conditions can lead in every person that he loses the reality - the term, says Fox.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only factors.
Researchers assume that affected minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronale maturation of the brain at an early stage of development, by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, for example, Fox.
But it remains a mystery, as the disruption of the neural system, is also not first over many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for psychosis, if the there is there.
Also halluzinogene drugs can trigger psychosis, as they are in the transmittersystem system.
If our brain hot runs
is the, Psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs in order to get rid of them, others give money for drugs in order to get, says the Lbecker psychology professor Erich castes.
whether images as pleasant or unpleasant, is often only a question of the position.
collects for ten years, reports of hallucinations and trugerscheinungen phenomena, last year, he has his results in the book "the unreal world in our head" evaluated.
hallucinations are among the typical effects of psychosis, but also of astonishing many other diseases.
These include mental disorders, such as Border or depression often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease and brain trauma.
Surprisingly, halluziniert under certain conditions, even the brain healthy people.
hallucinations, castes, from memory content, which would normally be withheld.
They arise when brain areas, in which sensory processing, are discouraged or too little; if our brains hot or even if stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state just as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also of deprivation, stress, mental pain or other emergency situations.
In recent studies, up to a third of the respondents, at least once in to have experienced a hallucinations.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in mecklenburg - Western Pomerania and visited the school.
A normal girl, really.
If not the images and voices.
In the break, it can happen that a schlaksiger boy with long, dark hair it.
If he replies, look the classmates it surprised - no one else sees or hears these boys.
They think the timid girl for a versponnene Tagtrumerin, but Sarah K. dreams, it knows it.
It is awake, they see and hear these boys, just as the girl in the bank to and see.
You can feel his presence even, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that they may be the boys.
Am I crazy?, asks them sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other images are not real, and disappear again.
At night, are the phenomena most frightening
The images are also a burden.
If you are sitting in the class, they can follow the teaching material sometimes, because the teachers in their eyes and ears just unveils a new classmates, while for all other - and visible on the of mathematical equations.
night are the phenomena at frightening.
If they are in their dark room to sleep, which is far too little and too late, they often not distinguish whether it is awake or or whether the pictures, you see the fratzen or the girl, arms and legs, with the bleeding wounds before their open or closed eyes.
Let me in, they to the characters.
parents and friends told them nothing, would you consider to be crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She has in the past year the baccalaureate and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since on the Internet contact with the psychologists caste, it knows that it is not crazy.
Cow is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially or isolated withdrawal, he has, in all probability after a while hallucinations, says castes.
I suspect that the brain is underemployed, and even for his entertainment.
Sarah K., a Einzelkind, as a little girl fear of other children, often played alone.
their hallucinations when they began with 13 learned that the man, is called Daddy, since they can think not their leiblicher father.
As visual and acoustic hallucinations the same brain areas are active, the real impressions and process, it is affected as Sarah K. difficult to distinguish, images and reality. "every experience," says caste, "will take place in the brain, the reality is there.
hallucinations are also images of the brain, that is why they so real. "
Also night dream images digesting caste as a form of hallucinations.
The hallucinations of healthy do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenic are mentally healthy in the situation to, their images as unreal.
Caste advises his patients, therefore, the hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucinations
In our very too much bewusstseinszentrierten world imaginary experience unfortunately, most pathologisiert, says Michael Schmidt - Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy of Florence Nightingale - hospital in Dsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also has positive, creative - - is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt - Degenhard has researched the so - called oneiroide experience form, a particular form of traumartig modified guard awareness.
Oneiroide are highly - complex, detailed Quasi dreams, the erlebende for real and he also cannot distinguish the in hindsight.
The oneiroide consciousness state in trauma or illness extreme situations, for example, in Polyradikulitis - patients, in full awareness of a motor paralysis.
by continuing total impotence, for example, if a person is threatened by loss of self - and world, he replaced the life - threatening reality through its own imaginary world, the reality is, says Schmidt - Degenhard.
A kind of border state between dream and hallucinations.
Since the deal with a situation in the reality is not possible, a world change taking place, the real situation but is in the imagination.
An intensive form of sense Foundation and, in an intolerable situation, which allows us to people own ability, not submerged in a loss of loss.
Everything is real, later in the memory
also the Zrcher art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his Oneiroid - experiences in his book "change change" as a bailout of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a heart valves operation, followed by a heart transplant for days on travel, while his body to the intensive care unit of doomed.
Claussen a appears in a created world, other times and places: he is seen as bettlgerigen, old man, on board a Zugsanatoriums, a robot on his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles, the drugs from blood.
by a Greeks on the motorcycle in his own country, surfing with his hospital bed in Firnschnee the Alps and a Korean Mafioso.
He is completely in the imagined, everything is real, later in the memory.
These internal travel for claussen differ fundamentally from any dream.
dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental travel even after years in minor details abundantly clear.
more and more even than really erlebtes.
The intensity of this Erlebens goes beyond the horizon of our other life experience, says the psychiatrist Schmidt - Degenhard hard.
Ultimately, show Oneiroide, psychoses, hallucinations and drugs binge, how fragile our internal copies of external reality in the guards.
Any change of Bewusstseinszustandes, say the psychologist caste, "can lead to a Verformung of what we call reality."
An experience which can also be enriching.

Burda
Children should take the publishing house with 27 years
The new publishing chief Kallen is an interim solution: in the long run will be Hubert Burda company in the hands of his two children, he said the mirror.
The holding company will in future to 100 percent of the family.
Hamburg - the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit with 27 years and have the firm will to enter the companies, said the 69 - Jhrige the mirror.
The details we have as a precautionary measure.
The question of whether they are active in the company, then.
The question of whether they are in a position to do so.
We cannot 7 500 staff his children, if they are not sufficient.
This brings the children and the company.
On Thursday burda had announced that he is from January by the January, and Paul - Bernhard Kallen appointed as his successor.
The 52 - year - old Kallen is a board member since 1999 in Burda.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury the responsibility for the company, and after the departure of Jrgen Todenhfer for direct marketing,, pressure and finances.
for the first time, is not a family member at the top of the Verlages.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also, "10 to 15 years to bridge," Burda.
The holding should continue to 100 percent of the family, said.
with regard to the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffler said burda that family businesses are not safe from the sinking: "it was always families who were infected by a capital, which have speculated completely and thought they could rise as the major player.
My strategy was never.
He had "never World Dreams," Burda.
I am not as the of this political przeptor country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to in the world league with 'time', these shops have become too great.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is limited, a device that can read his e - mails, without a possibility of being able to see certain annexes or surf the Internet.
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame as the magazine Time to one of the products of the year.
to see on the Strae is unlikely, but the idea is, nevertheless, especially for young people of interest.
In contrast to the Peek costs very little and has a very favourable flat rate, for example, only half of the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success that it has two new devices on the market: one, that is only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, quite unlike the Peek, in which it a six times higher price must pay.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same borders, as his American counterpart, has, however a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros per month, roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those with a Smartphone around the world, already know what it means to have to forgo all the data in order to be able to read his e - mails, once you cross the border or if you are desperately seeking a caf with WiFi (or a link with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly tempting and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already specific contracts and prices for abroad, but in my experience, you need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to read all the small print.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe remained almost always ignored.
Auerhalb's own country has always afraid to read his e - mails and rightly so.
That a small device as FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it has no WiFi / wlan) this kind of tariffs can offer, means that the telephone providers slowly but surely rethink and start to consider various ways, how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example, in its prices is the downloads of books and other questions on the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without snags.
It is a internetfhiges equipment and pay only once, at the time of purchase, and not every month.
and that is exactly what I expect of FonPeek one day, a buying opportunity with lifelong Internet access as it offers the Peek already in the United States.
and that is not because I want to buy it.
I read my e - mails with the telephone, thank you.
But I expect this, because I am of the opinion that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting, able to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish colour of Michelle
Yellow is without doubt the favourite colour of the American first lady.
the arrival of Barack Obama as President of the United States appeared in a dress and a coat of paint and has the same colour re - elected him in his, without doubt, to accompany second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has on two occasions very similar models, except that it was almost the same colour - a bright green yellow -, the clothes of three parts - dress, jacket and coat from the same substance, and it was something grofrmig gesticktes or a neck chain.
It even goes so far that it at first sight, that wanted to follow the first lady of the United States the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided wear the same dress to on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes but very much in the stoffart, from which they are made.
in Oslo at the inauguration, she wore a dress from head and one from gemusterten kid.
The accessories were different: the first time green shoes with high paragraphs and the second time a nhliches model, but goldfarben.
Also, the hair every time was different: the hair were on this occasion as hair wreath, with the previous open the hair.
75% of working mothers have because of their maternity problems in the work
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who wish to have children.
To this result is the study CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for women "fertility and career women in Spain."
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market because of their maternity.
The study is clear that there are broad differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether or not the women work and if so, what kind of work they perform.
Those of you who do of the House no other activity, only part - time work or have no fixed contract,, more be mothers and have more children.
In contrast, postpone the women with a solid job, particularly in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a solid job their first child on average only 3.7 years after the draw, a figure that increased to 4.1 years for women with permanent employment, which took longer to achieve this and her together, and have the first child until much later.
Auerdem also has the kind of work a great influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar in the contraceptive preparedness, "explains the CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor, at the age of the women in the marriage and the first child must be taken into account.
According to the survey is the age at the time of the marriage and the first child the higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference was also found in the women the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they are only the main education or a higher education, on average, each with 25,1 or 32.1 for the first time mother.
There are still, depending on their level of education, another difference between the women.
While the women with Hauptschlussabschluss before its first permanent employment and their first child, make it the women with a medium or high school exactly the other way around and find a permanent employment and marry later and then have their first child, Delgado.
Diane Kruger, it is also worth
its widely envied list of botschafterinnen l'oral Paris has recently added a new name: Diane Kruger.
From next year will be the German actress the image of various products of the brand and also the well - known slogan "because you are worth it".
The main performer from "Joyeux Nol, one of the most elegant actresses at international level, it will be another famous advertisement as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and a Spaniard Penlope Cruz.
She was the last to join this exclusive club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
among ambassador: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's men, the cosmetics company also only Anatomy ') and Matthew Fox (spectacle colleague of Evangeline in" lost ").
The award of the British fashion industry

The ex model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia may Jagger, was elected the best model this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presented in "poker the Asse" (Alfaguara, depictions of Fernando Vicente) to the dreiig X - ray images of writers, the him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He used a predictable and furchteinflendes genre (short biography, life and work), but is looking for a nhlichkeit the fervent heart of the creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent saves neither horrors still Erleuchtungen.
Except that this book is a kstlicher enjoy, it is also a moving call to read and and again.
Here are a few sequences from the book.

Cowardly aggression
My 70 - year - old mother was last week through our city in the town of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years alongside their and our dog herliefen, our dog is a Mischling, we have taken from the animal and just six kilos, and then out of the blue missed him two futritte and injured him so hard.
can is not in words, our outrage because it is incomprehensible to us, where the fun in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which, of course, to be on the leash.
in the attack, a woman who was walking comfortable, these people as a result of the incident, they wanted to chastise they as even feared for their own lives, because if a that attacked a dog, he will be the same, perhaps with a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman or probably even with each, the weaker than he is.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighbourhoods at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has geheult all day long.
of course, we have, in a nahgelegenen police department, however, we have serious doubts as to whether this will bring anything and in order to prevent any prejudice from the outset, we would just make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation about what has happened has led us to this incident.
We cannot understand what must be in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a defenceless animal fun, an animal that we love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for road safety (fesvial) a campaign to promote the use, especially among the younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative will draw attention to the importance of the helmet use, because it is ultimately the only protection element, the head injury or even death can prevent in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to the road safety, "far more than just the design and manufacture of products, and always with every day secure" and confirmed that they help with other actions educational and informative nature to come a step closer to this objective every day.
This new campaign to promote the use on the motorcycle, under the slogan 'to be or not to be' is, in a first phase posters of about 500 motorcycle workshops, so as to achieve the best possible spread.
Finally the, Michelin, stressed that the road safety "a constant concern" of the company, and it is precisely for the reason that they are obliged to manufacturers of tyres for two - rdige vehicles always see that one of its main objectives of the development of safer products.
The sale of small is rising again something
After almost two years of starting the car market for small trucks finally some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles, were in November in Spain mean an increase of 12.6% in the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase at after 22 consecutive months with decline, according to the manufacturers' association Anfac and the car dealers' association Ganvam presented figures.
These good figures are to enjoy, but currently only with great caution, as the reference data used comparison in November 2008, which was a particularly bad Verkausjahr with a drop of 60% on the previous year.
However, we bear in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the overall of these 11 months still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95.853 vehicles sold, in this figure but all vehicles, from which the small market is contain: descendants of passenger cars, pick - ups, vans, small vans and lighter vans / chassis.
Furthermore, are still the same storm clouds in the sky, the demand the most, because even if some of the vehicles will be purchased by individuals, the Groteil the sales to small and medium - sized enterprises, which almost 100% of all cases the purchase with a third party financing.
So we have to these restrictions, which are the result of the tap of credit institutions, with einschlieen other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this situation and, unlike the cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the plan 2000e little.
This plan is not only for individuals, the self - employed and small businesses have a right to expect that a vans up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 Ausstoss, must not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, want to buy, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday had ganvam reminded that it is necessary on the part of the state, including a special attention to these small vices and, of course, also on the industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The car dealers association predicts for the year 2010 a similar, just as the last, for which it with a sales (in passenger cars and SUVs) by 19%.
The support for bremsmanvern in critical situations is now duty
as the case the Antiblockierbremssystem ABS and how it is now happening with the stability control ESP, must aid systems on the brakes in emergency a duty in the European cars.
In fact, they are already duty on all newly registered passenger cars and light trucks, for the remaining vehicles was a waiting period by the end of February 2011.
The Manahme adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these can also braking systems because of their operation to prevent many front - collisions.
The task of the notbremsassistenten is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical Bremsmanvers, which recognises the system on the basis of the bremsstrke carried on the pedal to.
However, this system pressure is not until the end.
According to one of the components manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles commissioned study, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the Zusammenstoss no longer to on the brake pedal and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The Bremshilfe with maximum force in the braking system and reduce the Bremszeit and therefore also the Bremsabstand, a car in the bremsvorgang process.
According to a study by the EU could each year up to 1,100 fatal accidents, which to damage, be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of notbremsassistenten.
It would be even fewer accidents - it is estimated that could be prevented every fourth accident involving personal injury - as the so - called intelligent emergency systems are popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that (on radar or a camera) obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time, a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver then responded, helps him the system, to increase the pressure on the brake pedal, if it would be necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the Zusammenstoss is inevitable, the bremsassistent the maximum pressure on the brakes, in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postponing the plan for Opel until January
While the workforce of the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, have been informed that will launch the production of the new Meriva in the first week of April, probably on 8, according to Mr Ortega, the American car manufacturers to indicate that he needs more time to the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, ensure that the affected side their assent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, the first the workers and then the governments of the countries in which it works, will be presented by until the beginning of 2010.
Dementgegen from GM that it will in the next few days will take a decision on the sale of Saab.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car Bauer, so that is a decision as soon as possible.
GM is to, with some potential new buyers in contact.
One of these buyers could be Geely, which also would like to buy Volvo, however, the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper - sports, which the Russian group Converg backing, ever.
If it should come to an agreement with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese Baic.
The decision to schlieen Saab at the end of the year, if it has not sold by sold, will also continue.
the helm of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
for the development of their latest and very expensive jewel engineers used the Boxster S as a base and made it really, to make it easier to 80 kilos, and he is now only 1.275 kilo on.
order to create something they refrained from first to the automatic aufklappbare roof, has been replaced by a Zeltleinwanddach with manuellem accord, so that alone has saved 21 kg; thanks to the used in this model, as the gt3 "disappearance" further 15; by the removal of the air conditioning again in 13; it was also the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, that were saved another 7 kilo; saved through the installation of sporting Bacquet - seats again 12 and with the light 19 - customs wheels again five.
Then we had achieved through the audio system CDR - six kilos less and again 30 through the exchange of trgriffe by griffe from substance the lack of kilo.
Although he also with the doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK is available, the test ride in a car with 6 - hand wheels, mainly carried out on the smaller landstraen of California, on mountain routes, which were really very kurvig.
during his behaviour can give only the note perfectly.
The reduction of its weight, but has not meant that he would no longer so sure on the Strae.
Rather, the opposite is the case: for long, we have no such a small and easy model test, which but also a sense of groer security in the curves, even at high speed.
It is a small athlete, able to make his muscles in a low gear in the time time warm until we give him the orders to rasen, to slow down, to recover and then again get everything from his engine to...
He makes everything he says. The car makes everything we him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its management, which is just as communicative and precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 Boxers with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and we can raise it with the 'sport' option and by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which was already the Panamera used for the first time.
The acceleration is unimaginable brutal, whether from the foot or when renewed acceleration.
The Federungen are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the Landstraen on which we went with the Boxster Spyder, was damaged, but the car meisterte the potholes.
The electronic assistants had to do on the whole route almost nothing; and that, although we in some of these curves ice at dawn and Rollsplitt this morning.
In summary, we can say that it is an ultra - car, a car, with an indescribable fahrspass, as it rather rare and it is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster SS.
The car will come on the market in February 2010 and 70.831 euro.

Eidson and Pnini contributed significantly to the that the "yellow" umdrehten (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but anything other than dead, had to prepare a few gambits with accuracy, in order to get air and one of them suddenly the gun of Mirza Teletovic, with three almost three times and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that on the ads again einberuhigender gap of (54), the hosts at the end of the third quarter with (67) could make.
The Alavesen in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60 to 75) already announced that they would allow them the victory to which they had earned in the first dreiig minutes, away again.
Nevertheless, resigned Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team and tried to give their team by three points from the line (77).
Nevertheless, and the cluster because Fouls the place, not on the team of Ivanovic, defended well and although the Israelis in the last minute (was - 85), the game had already a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season.

Thank you!
After the glowing days since last spring, in which was the inflation of assets the prevailing mood in the markets, is the uncertainty in the markets, which is surprising in any case, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the broker decisions on an inherently uncertain future.
The Manahme used to stabilize the markets, it was with the direct purchase of assets to pay the debt and indirectly the liquidity free hand in interest rates, the move to zero, so that the banks buy assets to Abrechnen in this way.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets as well as ended and without their heterodox policy to liquidity in question, start to throw a spanner in the works, as the BCE nc already with its annual auction, which takes place next week.
That is why investors have doubts about the ability of the world economy, the economic recovery without these heterodox Manahmen and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The flchtigkeiten the stock markets and the differences in corporate bonuses rise again, even if they are still a long way from the paranormalen - normal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states have been forced to nationalize the private risks and the national debt rise again.
It is now back on quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge of investors, which in turn to an increase of the differences of countries in the euro zone in regard to Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards on the assessment of Spain.
a degree of uncertainty on the other hand, does not harm the defenders of the moral hazard to silence the had tried again, with the leaders of the world economic policy an awareness, for what they had caused to produce, since the devastating effects, which the restriction of credit to the loss of jobs, had slowed down, when they should have actually a new day thanks to action.
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai, a tribal war between the emiren to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was also previously earlier.
A government which the public debt, elections and a new government, which on the same side.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Scrates in Portugal after Duro Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year from the non - of its external payments and therefore a euro member country, no longer meet its obligations.
It is logical that Ecofin forced the Greek government has to be transparent and its citizens in need of auergewhnlicchen Manahmen with the, in order to maintain the stability of the state money.
Yes, we are as expected from an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excesses to large amounts, would now lie within the expected.
in the case of Spain, we need not worry, as long as the differences of public debt with the same speed as the European corporate bonuses.
However, should the European differences and increase the Spanish, dannn would be a special Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the early indicators of a Groteil of market research institutes to correct their scenarios for the recovery and their scenario for 2011 upwards, the OCDE and the European Commission, which again with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy come along all the despite warnings a long life.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stock, although at the moment, "caution when driving".
Associated industries
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Snchez Galn, came as first yesterday before the subcommittee of the House, where in these days the strategy in relation to the energy supply of Spain in the next two decades.
After his appearance, the chairman of gas natural - fenosa, rafael villaseca followed Galn the press a few key points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind versschlossenen doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain 50 billion by 2020 Euround further 60 billion from that date until 2030, under the promotion that the current nuclear power stations continue to remain in operation.
Should this not be the case, the investment needed not to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that it should not invest more in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international groupings.
the question will change from 2020, and we should increase the performance.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to capture the carbon dioxide and, of course, especially on renewable energy.
In this case, he estimated that 18,000 MW more, under the will of course by other "Sttzenergien."
Galn, is of the opinion that the Gesetentwurf for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, in line with what has called for his company, wanted to say in any case against this law, how to create incentives for the national coal consumption, what exactly the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term is clearly in this direction, despite some" individual "Manahmen, as the chairman of Iberdrola.
it as it may, Galn believes that the decisions on the investment, even if these are, in the long term, because it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created, in order to tackle them.

The Australian market for infrastructure promises huge construction and privatisations, has a hurdle to overcome, however, because you only through the purchase of a local Bauunternehmens access.
A strategy of the companies high deep or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian credentials, followed, and by the Spanish Baugiganten still needs to be pursued.
Even ACS has on this market only through his participation of 30% of in high - low, owner of the aforementioned Leighton, gained access.
Million in assets
Acciona is on this geographical area of the highest importance for the industry in which it already because of his work as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry is known.
Among other assets has already its grten windmills Park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies, which was entrusted with the to build desalination plant of Adelaide with a budget of 700 million and manage.
His intention now is to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies, in order to gain access to the arms of construction and infrastructure.
The underground toll route by the Office for infrastructure of the city of Brisbane and northern link (North nordzubringer) heien has to, the purpose, the Western motorway in Toowong with the umgehungstrae in kelvin grove (see map) to a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels. It is the grte Manahme to reduce congestion on the straen of Brisbane.
The government spent roadmap provides for the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll already route for traffic in recent months to open by 2014, assumption is that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was drafted in 2005.
He has two fahrspuren in every direction, an electronic toll system and a complex entlftungssystem.
The government of country involved with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) in financing.
for high Brisbane is a big business.
Australia - deep, yesterday a contract with the government of $154 million, always significant contracts.
