The shortage of snow in mountain hoteliers 
The deserted do not pose a problem for operators of ski. 
The lack of snow deters people to book their stays in skiing in hotels and pensions. 
Therefore, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and the New Year. 
We have a lot of visits on our site. 
Internet users travel offers, asking prices but dare not commit to set aside for the moment. 
And if they call, they ask immediately whether there will be snow or mud at Christmas, "said Martin Jandura, operator of the portal of information spindl. Info. 
If one wants to spend the New Year of his dreams to Špindlerův Mlýn, better too hesitate to reserve. 
Prioritising economies and that the quality of accommodation is then, then we can try to wait a few more days. 
The hotel of Špindler proposes for the moment that stays of one week to the New Year. 
I think they will try one more time of the place, but they also cèderont and accept shorter periods. 
And then the number of rooms free will rapidly diminish, "said Jandura. 
The agency of tourism Ingtours of Vrchlabí also proposes still beds of free for all periods of winter. 
The week of Christmas interests us most at the moment, it is not completely sold. 
There are still free, say, half of the chambers in our offer. 
That is why we have already prepared a few stays Christmas last-minute cheaper, "said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert. 
The agency of tourism Vrchlabí can also propose the New Year to Krkonoše, but there are fewer free seats. 
The fourteen days of February are equally well, stays winter remaining sell moderately. 
This year, the interest for winter has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow to Krkonoše. 
People expect it to fall. 
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountains. 
If the overlap during the week, Christmas also will be complete, "think Schiefert. 
In contrast, the occupation of the hotel Horizont to Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year. 
It was an improvement of about five percent. 
We have few places for the New Year as for Christmas. 
There is a great interest during the holidays of Polish January and February sells well also, "said Karel Rada, director of the best hotel of Pec. 
The hotel Omnia near the central park of Jánské Lázně is also full of eighty percent during the period of the New Year. 
On the contrary, half of the beds are empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel of Jánské Lázně. 
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already sixty percent of occupation. 
February is a little more low at the moment, but as soon as the snow will fall, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše builds certainly still indicated the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch. 
The hotel of Krkonoše should not expect more snow. 
On Thursday it will more fees and if there is precipitation, they should be neigeuses mountain. 
But the time should warm up, informs Jiří Jakubský of the station Hradec Institute stations Czech. 
United States: Répétition is the mother of wisdom 
It is comical even, the painstaking effort with which Barack Obama, President to the reputation of wise, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, that he considered himself as simple. 
When he eventually leave sweat its doctrine so ardently expected, it turned out that he had been replicated carbon paper since the Iraqi scenario of Bush three years ago. 
Not content to use in the text "as in Iraq," what is more, it did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's speech in January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new way forward" 
At the same time, he has personally criticized the idea of Bush to send reinforcements in an Iraq him by civil war as "irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its catastrophic consequences." 
The following month, however, have shown that the strategy of Bush, who came out of the recommendations of commanders of campaigns, was the only possible and likely to success that newspapers currently do not speak of Iraq. 
This has not enhanced the reputation of Bush, having said that, objectively speaking, it was left to his successor a final situation much more favourable than we could have hoped. 
Barack Obama hope that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen 
These are the commanders of campaigns that have requested an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the operation in Afghanistan, General Stanley McCristal, which has severely criticised the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination. 
It asked 40 000 men in order to make the situation more favourable. 
The President has dithered for three months but in the absence of a better option, at least it has cheated the general of 10 000 soldiers. 
He has managed to root out the promise of 5 000 extra on the part of Europe, even if it were on 10 000. 
The most problems throughout the strategy Obama appears to be its intention to withdraw the armies of Afghanistan by 18 months and to complete this process within three years. The doctrine of Obama brings more questions than it provides answers. 
Many doubts about the fact that an increase of half will bring the same fruit that progress in Iraq. 
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organised and its leaders to honour the agreements. 
The Afghan situation stands by the exact opposite - we cannot rely on person and no treaty is respected. 
In these conditions, difficult to prepare for Afghan security forces, accustomed to change leader from day to day depending on what suits them. 
The political institutions, although based officially dressing behind which will proliferate the patriarchal ethnic relations. 
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity about the reports, which are still complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences. 
Even the foundation of a "quick to act," which is the aim of the operation, does not seem to be very real. 
The time horizon of the strategy Obama makes perplexed by his determination. 
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has worsened and she is currently on the brink of chaos. 
Only a heart purely romantic and out of the reality can be persuaded that the toy soldiers sent in the tumult of the war for their "swift return to the house" will bring a real miracle. 
From a political point of view, set a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible because the Taliban will regard as the indirect admission of defeat. 
The last NATO summit has shown that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan the negative. 
European politicians know or do not want to explain to their constituents what security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush. 
Another factor capable of radically alter the situation is the development of events related to Iran. 
If the situation continues to deteriorate and that the sanctions have not effects on the Iranian, the American will face the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force. 
It will respond by example when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. 
Each solution of this type will, however, a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation. 
The only stopgap for Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for that it is working on a new strategy, in case it would be revealed to be a flop. 
The leaders of the bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive bonuses in cash 
Employees senior leaders of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will receive this year of cash bonuses. 
The company announced in response to strong criticism of its pay practices. 
The Group of 30 key leaders will receive actions instead of money, they will not sell within five years. 
The actions can be withdrawn to leaders in cases where they would take too many risks. 
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is to lead the effort to link the pay with long-term performance on Wall Street. 
I assume that Wall Street is well aware of the global sense that, "said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of society's takeover 
The concern is in the details, he added. 
The bank Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after set aside almost $17 billion in premiums on the first three quarters of this year. 
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $20 billion in spite of the announcement today, according to the Reuters news agency. 
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the huge bonuses in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries. 
Britain announced Wednesday that it will affect a single fee fifty percent bankers' bonuses in excess of £25.000. 
France is preparing similar measures. 
This year women received the Nobel Prize in all areas apart from the physical 
Five women, a record number, which have received today in Stockholm at the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prize in the technical disciplines and literature. 
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller. 
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received with their fellow countryman Jack Szostak the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes. 
The price of chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Hada Jonath with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of the ribosome 
The last winner was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics, the American Elinor Ostrom's work with his fellow countryman Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance. 
The only technical discipline which has not been a winner this year has been the physical. 
The prize was awarded today scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibres and George Smith avecWillard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently at the forefront of all digital cameras, fax or glasses astronomical. 
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and certificate of acquisition of the reward. 
More than ten million Swedish kronor in each category. (approximately 1,1 million) 
If one of them had several winners, they will share the reward them.

The Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus has invited the Chateau 
President Václav Klaus will Friday morning the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which pondère his stay in government because of its disagreement with the state budget for next year as it was passed by the House of Deputies 
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota the cabinet will be on the agenda for their meeting Friday. 
Klaus also criticizes the budget. 
According to him, the deficit is too important, which is widening the crisis of public finances. 
It is the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat who advised of the meeting. 
Janota then discuss its function on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer. 
According to the legislation on the budget which will be submitted to the signing of Klaus is a deficit of 163 billion kronor that the Czech Republic should manage. 
Nevertheless, the House of Representatives has approved Wednesday the proposals of the left on money transfers and increased the pay of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers. 
The government blamed the proposals of social democrats the fact that they would increase indirectly the budget deficit. 
For this reason, a violent disagreement is born between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and right on the other hand, disagreement which calls into question the future of Fischer's office who had been trained by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party. 
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by the Members, deletes the package of savings spent by the government of Fischer and according to stem the debt of the state. 
Klaus, who may ratify the law on the state budget but that nothing, said today during a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, that the policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the irréfrénable "weakness" of public finances. 
Now, according to him, there is no solution. 
Only a strong government could contribute to an improvement, if he could rely on a consensus of political parties, according to the president. 
The president of the ODS Mirek Topolánek has indicated that the budget is staggering and that the government should call into question its existence. 
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas told the ČTK that the idea of a cabinet administrative supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Greens is patently more. 
In its response, the Prime Minister Fischer described such words of verdicts "drastic verdicts. 
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit for this year by the former government of Topolánek is staggering and that it will exceed 200 billion kronor. 
On Wednesday, the ČSSD has described the ratification of the State budget for the next year. 
The People's Party was also satisfied. 
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new film Clint Eastwood 
Despite criticism of the fact that the central roles played by American actors, South Africans say that the new film of Hollywood Invictus - Invaincu will in the world a lot about the country, its fighting and its victories. 
History speaks of sport, of relations between races and Nelson Mandela. 
Morgan Freeman, American actor rewarded the Oscars, embodies the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and first black president. 
Freeman said, that this is a Mandela aged ninety-one years who asked him to embody in the film. 
Matt Damon plays another important role. 
I told him: "If I must embody, I should be able to see you personally. 
The actor aged police-custody years which has been rewarded for a price for his role in the drama Milion Dollar Baby of Clint Eastwood located in the middle of boxing has, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery become itself slave, an U.S. president shadow, or even God in the film Evan Almighty but never a yet living and also important for so many people that is Mandela. 
The ex-homme State South African was imprisoned 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa. 
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years. 
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. 
Invictus is a Latin word meaning unbeaten and it is the title of a poem in the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875. 
The challenge was to speak with him. 
The film tells the true story of the efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the team of South African rugby François to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country resteencore and always divided racialement and economically after apartheid. 
It is sure to unite his people by sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the "outsiders" in the world. 
The South African team will progress in World Cup in 1995. 
Freeman has worked a few years to bring the history of Mandela on big screen. 
I had no other purpose if not play this role to the of the reality, said Freeman. 
The biggest challenge for me it was of course to talk like him 
The actor said that if he and the politician international were in the same region, it would have tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech. 
The most important thing for him was to shake hands. 
I realized that when I give you my hand, I under-expended of your energy, it is transmitted and I had the impression of how you feel, "he said. 
It is important for me to try to become another person. 
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players. 
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for a role in the middle of the rugby. 
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise. 
I remember when I come to the door of the house, he opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I air much greater in the film ". 
Despite the differences between the actors and models, Invictus under the guidance of director Eastwood received positive opinions and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars. 
The criticism of films Todd McCarthy newspaper Daily Variety summed up its assessment in these words: "It is a very good story, a film very well done." 
In the evaluations of films on the site rottentomatoes. Com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive assessments. 
The mystery of the aura in Norway is resolved: the Russian testing a rocket 
There has been a strange phenomenon of unknown origin above Norway. 
The Russian defence ministry has recognized that yesterday tested a rocket intercontinental ballistic missile near borders Norwegian. 
The launch has still been a failure and the missile "Bulava" which was originally scheduled to be the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. 
His presence frequentlyrepeated during tests of the rocket has not had the desired effect on the success of flights. 
Most of the time, Bulava did not surge, or it was damaged during flight. 
Russian newspapers talk of "Bulava" as "missile which do not steal" 
A missile which do not steal but who is conspicuous 
This 13th test took place at the beginning. 
It is only at the end of the flight that there was further damage to the equipment. 
It is clearly the driving force behind the third floor of the rocket that exploded. 
This time, "Bulava" is soaring nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea. 
This type of missile can be precisely detonated a boat in movement and submerged 
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object precisely the was by a "Bulava" flawed. 
Moreover, the Norwegian did not doubt for a moment that it is a Russian rocket. 
The generals argue that this time, we cannot talk of failure. 
The first two floors of the rocket resisted and damage has affected than the third. 
In previous cases, the engines have experienced on the first floor. 
Although none of the test launches happened smoothly, the leadership of the Department of Defense considers that only six out of thirteen have been failures. 
This success rate of almost fifty percent fills the general optimism and they say that one day "Bulava" fly without problems and that it will even ten nuclei nuclear hypersoniques a total weight of 1,15 tonnes. 
The legendary Fetissov 51 years signed an one-year contract with the CSKA Moscow 
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov occur again in a professional match in 51 years. 
The former world champion, Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will assist his team of CSKA Moscow in need and will make its entry probablementdéjà at the match Friday against Petrograd. 
Fetissov, who ended his career to forty years in 1998, is currently the President of the CSKA. 
After the injury of Denis Kuliash we urgently need another defender. 
Fetissov is has regularly and agrees to help the team. 
We still need to work out a few details on the form, "says the jobcoach club Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP. 
It was not clear whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will only one match. 
I think that Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mental of other players, "said Nyemtchinov. 
According to AP, in the case of his return on the ice, Fetissov becomes the hockey player professional Russian the older. 
In NHL, the legendary attacking Gordie Howe has played a season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 aid.

Hyundai has listened to the trade unions and cancels all overtime 
The leadership of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice has agreed with unions to cancel all overtime. 
It is precisely because of frequent overtime that unions have declared a state of emergency strike on Monday. 
The spokesman Petr Vaněk plant Hyundai has confirmed. 
Management, however, still reach an agreement with the unions on a Saturday worked this year. 
We cannot renounce our plan of production, it is essential that's why overtime volunteers have been proposed Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, said Vaněk. 
The site sedmička. Cz indicated that the company has proposed a bonus CZK 400 employees who would be part of the team on Saturday. 
It will be awarded the ex-post evaluation for the day worked on 28 November. 
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime. 
Either they receive the supplement for hours, or they can pose a leave of replacement on 28 December and extend their Christmas aindiqué Vaněk. 
In addition to that all employees present Saturday will receive compensation for the costs of transport and for their lunch. 
Given that the extra hours were the most urgent and the warmer in the comments and the demands of the trade unions and employees who have ceased spontaneously production last week, management has taken the decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, "said Vaněk. 
Until last week, the employees of the car factory were forced to work almost daily two hours in more of their eight hours. 
The unions plan to cancel the state of strike after signing of the agreement. 
Following the negotiation between the leadership of the car factory and trade unions must take place Friday afternoon. 
The union leader Petr Kuchař said Wednesday that they were ready to stop the state to strike in the event of agreement on their demands and signing of a joint document. 
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously on strike because of incessant overtime. 
They were protesting against the poor pay and conditions of so-called bizutages. 
Management has defended with the fact that the employees had to work as a supplement to meet the imperatives of production of cars. 
Since the announcement of the strike on Monday, the trade unions have also called for employees who have ceased production are not subject to any sanction. 
The unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime. 
In addition, they want this year honouraria of SEK 5 000 (€209). 
The car factory Hyundai of Nošovice currently employs 2 000 people. 
She started the series production last year in November. 
She has produced about 80.000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200.000 cars per year. 
Czech discovery: a substance that works on the HIV virus "hard-working people" also 
A team of scientists Czech and German test new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body. 
The main advantage of improved the substance is that it is also on the virus which have already developed an immunity to medicines. 
This is, in some cases, the upper hand on the fact that the combination is not as hard on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available. 
It is not possible to cure AIDS. 
It nevertheless can radically prolong the life of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of HIV in the body. 
Their consumption, however, there is a series of side effects. 
More repression of this increase is the development of so-called resistant viruses on which drugs have more effect. 
The work of the experts of three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to cope with the resistance of the virus. 
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus. 
The metalocarboranes are a collection of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt. 
This combination is blocking the development of the virus in a different way of all drugs used to date and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance. 
The work of researchers leads them to discover new substances "improved ", on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their links on the protein from the virus. 
The metalocarboranes have a single three-dimensional structure: two cages to multiple walls are trained by the atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon and linked by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt. 
A virus traitor and resilient. 
The protéase HIV is a protein from the HIV virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus. 
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the protéase HIV there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus. 
If we stop the protéase HIV, it will stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, school-enrolment researchers in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. 
In their work published in the scientific journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short link, which is then systematically amended. 
A little weaker but more reliable. 
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the protéases HIV has been tested in test tubes and its variants resistant, obtained from patients infected with HIV. 
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on medicines clinical, however it is not diminishing on versions resistant against which the current medicines are often ineffective. 
The metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are interesting combinations to examine more to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the laboratory of structural biology from the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics Institute of the Academy of Sciences. 
Dispute surrounding the budget. The ODS is attacking Fischer, who denies 
The chairman of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), Mirek Topolánek has described as "amazing" ratified the budget for the following year and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should threaten its existence. 
The Prime Minister described the ODS of drastic verdict. 
He says take time to analyse. 
The spokesman of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the idea of a cabinet administrative supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party working more. 
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether ilprend to the Chamber of Deputies on the minority who cares to combat the growing deficit, or if it is to remain in office with the assistance of the Left. 
Nečas has warned that the positions of the ODS and social democrats in relation to the problems of public deficits are diametrically opposed. 
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, with the amendments to the tune of 12 billion kronor included by the left. 
The House has increased the money for salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers. 
The grievance government towards the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they were increasing indirectly the budget deficit. 
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion kronor. 
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, obeying the desire of the government that a revised budget is a variant less bad than a budget. 
Disappointment and uselessness 
The Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of uselessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will consider the current situation. 
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in case of ratification of the proposed changes, the situation might be different. 
According to the Czech Television, Janota took meeting on Monday with Prime Minister after its passage through government: 
He said at the same time that he wondered if he would remain in office. 
His disappointment about the budget negotiations is the reason. 
If Fischer decides to continue to fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, which have imposed changes to the budget, have their place in the government. 
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will step down if the House ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit such as those affecting the health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the law on services. 
Mr Topolánek: ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question. 
This is the case of the head of the government Fischer and the government. 
The ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing of harmful, said in a statement from the United States. 
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some departments profess TOP 09, who voted against the budget. 
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to give his resignation to fight against the amount of public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority which is currently in the House." 
That said, it should not be expected to support and tolerance of Democrats. 
I have not thought about it and that it will be on the agenda and I will dedicate, said since the House to journalists, the Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected government by Democrats. 
The Prime Minister Fischer has evaporated in the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels. 
The ODS has backtracked at the request of the Prime Minister. 
Nečas stressed at the same time that the ODS would probably have voted on Wednesday against the amended budget if he had not specifically asked Members Democrats to allow the vote on the budget. 
We do not have the feeling of being orphans, there is no small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not been accusations from the President of the Party in the House or in the country in negotiating the budget. 
I have not noticed that my vote would have been lacking. 
I already knew when I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the coming months would be a bolchévisation of the House and destruction of all that was positive, reacted Topolánek in person. 
According to the rescheduling of the ČD there will be fewer trains for the same charges. 
The Czech Railways will prohibit or limit from 13 December some express trains or regional less responsible and will instead some others. 
The full recovery of transport will fall on the day of entry into force of the new schedules of two percent compared to today. 
Most of the charges will not change, including tariffs and fare. 
For example, the inhabitants of the region in Ostrava who will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a rowing pendolino. 
On the contrary, will serve Bratislava. 
There will also be less fast trains on line Prague - Písek - 'České Budějovice, the hotline Prague - Letohrad will be drastically reduced. 
At regional level, the biggest decline in transport in the region of Hradec Králové of eight percent in total, Prague and its surroundings can celebrate an increase. 
Two night trains on line Prague - Tábor - 'České Budějovice are also cancelled and movement of some express trains on the line Prague - Písek -' České Budějovice will amount to only a few days in the week. 
Among the biggest changes, we can see the introduction of a new direct line of Milovice in Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change to Lysá nad Labem. 
This is the fifteenth line of suburban Esko, openness is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice. 
The lines distant towards the capital will have their final destination at the main railway station in Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží). 
The ČD will introduce more lines HC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk / Jeseník will leave by intervals of two hours. 
Travellers can no longer take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December. 
The bill this year for the regional railways: 200 million kroner. 
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Department of Transport and will pay the Railways next year in all four billion kronor to address the losses visible, the same amount as this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions who pay for their by a total of eight billion next year, as the state will participate to the tune of almost three billion. 
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive. 
The railways have newly signed a contract for ten years, until now the duration was always a year. 
The Railways like the system, which also explains that they have not used a price increase of the vast majority of tickets. 
The changes will affect only tickets a day ČD Net and tickets Internet reduced-price eLiška. 
For travellers without card reduction, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 krónur. 
The price of eLiška will depend on the miles, whereas previously it was valid between cities in a region of choice and was a single tariff of 160 kroner. 
The Filipino rebels are still more than 50 people, children have been released 
The rebels have kidnapped 75 people south of the Philippines, including a few primary school students and their teachers. 
The agency AFP who informed, but who spoke to the origin of 65 hostages. 
The 17 children have been released after eight hours, as well as a primary school teachers. 
The hostage-taking was held in the province of Agusan del Sur. 
Reported that about 19 rebels have used the hostages as human shields during a flight to the police. 
The local negotiators are trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages. 
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (PPC). 
According to the AFP agency, the police initially pursued the kidnappers following violence caused a settling of scores between two clans family. 
Martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao south of the Philippines because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed. 
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November linked to the administration of the governor there avait30 journalists. 
The governor of the province of southern Philippines has been arrested in the wake of suspected involvement in the massacre, and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential of Ampatuan.

It was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. 
The film contains high expectations as it is presented at a time when the South Africa is in full preparations for the World Cup, and because the media are woven by disturbing news about the increase of conflict and racial discrimination of the inhabitants of the black majority. 
According to the AP, the reaction to the new film are for the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations in the lead roles where "pavanent" Hollywood stars. 
Morgan Freeman is nevertheless, taking its own terms, proud of the film. 
I dreamt of this role for many years and I am well prepared. 
I also LUKIANTSEV personally met Nelson Mandela to power - as they say - of its energy back, he said at the first official film in Los Angeles. 
I think that is a good thing if we had the opportunity to remember via the film's personality and message of Mandela. 
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but this concerns everyone, he added.

The film based on the history of the British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the room who gave his creation to the people depicted the South African defender of human rights during his tenure at the presidency. 
Morgan Freeman tries to during the film to pick up two racial groups of a population long divided and even that Nelson Mandela in 1995 it between dressed swimwear national team of South Africa on the lawn of the World Cup, that South Africa had won. 
For being on the pitch, is regarded in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been widely cheered fourteen years ago mainly public white and has been recognized by the white populations. 
Let us hope that the football championship will manage to unite people again in one nation, "said the player rugby Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only" black "of the national team. 
It remains to be seen whether the South Africa tense situation will improve. 
The South African whites are however sceptical as recently entrusted in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, rugby fan who has fled to Britain.

Jančura will sue for defamation against three prefects of ČSSD 
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will file today complaint for libel against three prefects social democrats. 
And specifically against Michal Good Soldier Švejk region of South Moravia, against Radko Martínka of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík. 
Jančura has indicated in Dvacet minut of Radiožurnál. 
The complaint is linked to the attempt to society to use of regional railways in some regions. 
All regions have signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways. 
All three have attacked and say that the thin lips, while there has only made an offer for what they wanted to themselves. 
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the price of Czech Railways signed last week. 
Therefore we have to defend ourselves. 
It is in exchange calumnies on society Student Agency, said Jančura in Radiožurnál. 
Similarly, there was some evidence that no region has proceeded in line with European law. 
We are preparing a complaint to the European Commission. 
Good Soldier Švejk considers that the complaint of Mr Jančura represents the result of a media spectacle of free publicity for his company and his person. 
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and call on other prefects to do the same. 
I assume that this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Jančura who manipulates public opinion and using false and misleading arguments about The regional rail transport, "says novel ‘ The Good Soldier Švejk 
Jančura has already informed last week that it will invest a few million kroner in an advertisement which will include the unfavourable regions. 
He said to Radiožurnál that it halt the campaign after Christmas and that he intends to resume after the New Year. 
He said that the campaign will target corruption in the broad sense. 
Jančura began his campaign after the regions have agreed to entrust the Czech Railways exploitation of rail links to an order of about 150 billion krónur, without bidding. 
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice. 
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to Jančura threats of a Member of the ČSSD. 
The only threat was that if we do not stop, we could lose our licences bus. 
It is presented as a member of the ČSSD, I do not know who he is but I will not say his name, said Jančura today to Radiožurnál. 
Vaccination against the pneumocoques will be free and voluntary 
Vaccination against the increasing reversing the old habits as early as January. 
It will be the first to be free and voluntary for families. 
Some already, saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective. 
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against the pneumocoques culminent. 
The institute defines pharmaceutical already vaccines maximum prices that will pay for the health insurance. 
Specialists are also clear in the process of vaccination. 
A new vaccination. 
Free vaccines for children of August. 
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated against the increasing. 
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated. 
If we began vaccination last year or earlier, we will have to pay yourself vaccinations. 
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the 3th and the 5th month of the child. 
Last year a quarter of families has voluntarily vaccinated their children against the pneumocoques. 
Yet parents pay SEK 1600 or more for a dose. 
The vaccination of younger requires four doses. 
Experts estimate that each year the health insurance spend 300 to 450 000 krónur in doses of vaccine. 
They save on medical care that children would require. 
So far the state spent approximately SEK 500 000 per year for the vaccination of children. 
Vaccination repaid was introduced with the "package Janota ". 
The pneumocoques are the cause inflammation of the ear average but also serious infections including inflammation of put and blood poisoning. 
According to surveys in hospitals, there are up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by infections of pneumocoques. 
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced vaccination repaid. 
The vaccination is mandatory? 
There is advice on a possible obligation of vaccination in the future. 
From January, it must be covered by insurance and optional. 
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive. 
Its association promotes long since vaccination against the pneumocoques. 
At an international conference to which our association has participated, specialists were not really happy with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination. 
This is not ideal. 
On the other hand, we are pleased to have been able to impose at least this. 
I think it is a direction that we now need to follow Kalovský said. 
But the Department of Health does not change the process of vaccination against the pneumocoques. 
It is not for the moment, "said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň. 
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors. 
Hana Cabrnochová, chairman of the Society of specialised paediatricians, recognises that vaccination based on the volontariata its flaws. 
If all the children were vaccinated, it could consider a reduction of renewals vaccinations "In the situation where the vaccine is such a sum I understand the decision making voluntary vaccination 'said however Cabrnochová. 
Experts predict that next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their babies. 
Vaccination against the pneumocoques marks a break from the fact that this is the first vaccination of children which is financed by the insurance and not the state. 
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should free up funds for prevention, they économiseraient on possible future medical care. 
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves 
This is linked to the concerns of pediatricians practitioners, the purchase of vaccines. 
The original intention was to buy vaccines by insurers, doctors receiving in the same way as other products of vaccine provided by the state. 
Some Members feared that this would allow insurance "deduct the amount of health insurance." 
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for the insurance. 
According to estimates, pediatricians individually will invest nearly 40 000 kroner per month in vaccines, which is a substantial sum. 
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová. 
Always them and us 
Islam can be French? 
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state. 
Roger Bootle, Deloitte 
Some readers will be lured by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French do not like the headscarf" (2006), an elegant study and well documented on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for years and whose effects are still being felt today. 
The last book by Mr Bowen presents a fabric much broader and more ambitious. 
Good anthropologist, it does not want to know what the politicians and the media is saying on Islam in France, but what is happening in the country. 
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes which provide now in France this queM. Bozen calls "Muslim" spaces for 5 m- 6 m Muslims. 
He knows very well listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on issues that concern them most. 
A Muslim must marry in a mosque or at the town hall (or both)? 
The evolution and the rights of homosexuals should be taught to young Muslims? 
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim? 
A Muslim can use a banking system based on the interests to obtain a loan? 
These are the practical problems, "he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas concern the media. 
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, a Muslim Arab born in Switzerland. 
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society. 
They do not push the debate until the end. 
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam. 
Intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers of Sunni Islam purist associated with Saudi Arabia which nowadays, are a small part of Muslims in Europe. 
M Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and secularism of French could be compatible. 
But a compromise can be reached with the efforts of each camp. 
He wondered how the French politicians (and the intellectual elite guardian if virulent of secularism) are really committed to pluralism. 
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared with Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make compromises with secular republicanism. 
Rather than a growing pragmatism, he detects a "narrowness of key values ". 
Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet." 
The sight of deepest world 
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet. 
The ice is melting at an alarming rate, with a life that cannot survive elsewhere. 
Oil, gas, and fisheries are in new waters open, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake. 
In "On a thin layer of ice," Richard Ellis, writer and illustrateur, painted a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear. 
On the history and complicated political of the whaling, it describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were their evidence they pushed the polar bear. 
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous aspiring of 14 years who had to fight only the tip of its musket-shape, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true. 
Young cub, captured when they nageaient alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses. 
At the beginning of the twentieth century, a famous brought together 75 bears at the same time. 
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally a millionth of the surface necessary for an adult in liberté. Climate is rarely mentioned: a polar bears living in Singapore has become Paper because of algae which drove in his thick fur.

Mr Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and is often on the threat posed by hunters on the survival of the species. 
Although banned in Norway, in America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where hunters helicopter and Indians Inuits in motoski use fusilsd' assault powerful to hunt their game. 
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two nations of hunting that ice will remain the longest. 
In his new book, "After the ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of new Scientist, offers a clear summary and frightening of science of the Arctic and a fascinating overview of what may be the future there. 
Not that scientists have all the answers. 
Neither the atmosphéristes nor the océanographes cannot accurately describe the speed of change. 
This is not for lack of trying. 
Late nineteenth and early twentieth, travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen gave the initial information on the melting of the ice sheet. 
The submarines in the Cold War were then mapped the changes of relief sous-celle-ci. 
The satellite surveillance and the probes placed on the icebergs are a great help, but most of the work is done by men hardened, camping in the cold. 
Mr Anderson looking at the world extraordinary and tiny system dependent on the Arctic ice, formed by the nets of brackish water audience--and in freezing. 
But of the bear to microscopic marvels contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the ice, between 2013 and 2050. 
"in a few months, this may be our turn" 
The Marines, among the 6 000 people who have tabled wreaths on the graves to Arlington 
The first class De' Angello Robinson, 19, has made a trip of seven hours by bus to lay a wreath on the grave of a soldier that he had never met. 
For him and for the other Marines who made the trip to Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, in North Carolina in Cimetière Arlington National Cemetery for decorating graves, this day was devoted to pay tribute to the men and women who, one day, were in their place. 
In a few months, we will be sent, we may be in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers. 
If this were to happen, I would like someone to do the same thing for me, that is why I'm just trying to show respect. 
It was one of 6 000 volunteers to be gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans, in different sections of the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony. 
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company to Harrington, in Maine, launched the commemoration and others have decided to decorate hundreds of graves in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony. 
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen, each year the journey, stop in different cities on their way, to organize celebrations in honour of the military and the victims of terrorism. 
The Worcester also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America (Water-quality Nkr235 Across America), which aims to promote the event in all other states. 
This year, the volunteers have placed more than 16 000 wreaths on the graves of the cemetery of Arlington, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville National cemetery enArkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial to the victims of United Airlines flight 93 to Shanksville, Pennsylvania. 
For the second consecutive year, Walmart Foundation has given more than $150 000 to buy and carry the crowns. 
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said that she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a military career. 
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, it was a way to thank those who had sacrificed. 
It is a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, "she said. 
It is like going to a family tomb. 
Emmitouflée in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the lawn and the extensive hills of the cemetery. 
The volunteers chose graves old, dating back to the First and Second World War, as well as the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited that new graves, organizers said. 
The mood was cause for optimism, while children played and couples were held by the hand, bringing the crowns of pine costs on the graves grey. 
Every krona round had a dark green colour, with a little bow tie on the top. 
Nearby, was silent on the Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried. 
The United Service Organizations gave 1 000 krónur to decorate the section but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled the area. 
Individuals grieved without hiding, other priaient and families and friends in the cold air. 
Some read aloud the names engraved in stone while others looked to see small information cards black and white, sank in the wetland for those whose tomb had not yet been completed. 
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears, on the grave of her son. 
It is part of Zanesfield, in Ohio and had led eight hours to visit the grave of Marine sgt. GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July. 
No one should never forget thanks to what we are free … my son has paid for it, "she said. 
"long after I have disappeared, I want someone to remember him." 
An U.S. citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities 
The Cuban government has arrested an U.S. citizen given mobile phones and laptops in the country, said the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
The citizen, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda. 
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank. 
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana trying to access the inmate who was arrested on 5 December. 
The precise charges have not been made public, although under the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous ". 
All the revolutionary activities, including protests moderate and written criticism, the risk of arrest. 
The graffiti anti-gouvernementaux and speeches are regarded as serious crimes. 
Cuba has a community of walkout increasing, led by Yoani Sánchez, commentatrice People who writes often about how are husband and are followed and harassed by agents of the government. 
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but authorisations have always been denied. 
The detention of an U.S. citizen may increase tensions between the Communist government of brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration which pursues a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island. 
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times, on Friday night. 
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government by concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and to create more space for the opposition, so that the U.S. can reciprocate. 
Mobile phones and laptops are permitted to Cuba, although consumer goods and desired in a country or the average salary of an official is $15 per month. 
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are used primarily for text messages or for a 15 -minute conversation which corresponds to a day of pay. 
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited. 
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities. 
Cubans who want to connect often must communicate their name to the government. 
Access to many websites is restricted. 
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare. 
Most of the few U.S. prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, "says Gloria Berbena, press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. 
Berbena said she could not provide more information on the arrest. 
The arrest and detention are a big mistake. 
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed - providing free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, "said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas program of the group Human Rights Watch, which has recently published a report harsh on freedoms in Cuba, called" New Castro, even Cuba ", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his older brother. 
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, put on trial and imprisoned on the same day. 
He said that any solution would probably be policy and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the US, when the two countries are beginning to get a better dialogue. 
The Pakistani authorities deny a conspiracy to send men in Afghanistan 
Saturday, the Pakistani authorities have identified an organisation supposed to prepare a plot to send five men of Northern Virginia in Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that it would dismantle a significant network of recruiters of terrorists who move freely through the Internet in search of young men radicalized. 
Investigators said they were a personality insurgente hidden, known as the Saifullah who invited these men in Pakistan after having discovered when one of them has commented approving the waves terrorists on the site of YouTube video on the Internet. 
Arrived in Pakistan, these men have been guided by Saifullah who tried to reach the remote region of the tribal belt of Pakistan, home al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps. 
But a representative of the Pakistani secret services, who was informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had not managed to convince commanders al-Qaeda that these men were not involved in the plot of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network. 
They have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the mountains banned north-east become a haven of terrorism. 
They were seen as agents infiltrated. 
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case. 
The authorities said that the men were determined and that they are still trying to obtain the necessary licences for entry into the camps al-Qaeda when they were arrested by Pakistani law. 
The case of these five men - who remain in Pakistan and who are interviewed by the FBI - insist on the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in the determination of the people who trust. 
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the U.S. secret services have priority to infiltrate of men in the al-Qaeda network. 
The organization's recruiters play the role of gardes-barrières, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who can prove to be spies. 
According to analysts, the American potential recruits are studied closely by al-Qaeda. 
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and of their value propagandaire. 
However Feigenbaum Kohlmann, an expert of the Foundation NEFA based in the US, said that terrorist groups must also do more and more attention, in recent years in the choice of the people they accept because the U.S. secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods. 
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow its model of recruitment that so many other people have already taken? Said Kohlmann. 
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet. 
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen for "action" for the climate 
Tens of thousands of Protestants marched in the streets here Saturday, calling for more extensive action on the part of the negotiators working in the palace of congress Bella Convention Center of the city. 
The number of protesters was estimated at 100 000 people, but 25 000 according to estimates by the police. 
This event proceeded relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists has lit a few explosives near a cluster of government buildings in downtown city. 
On a day when little has happened during the discussions on the climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists marched through the city, deploying placards in English saying 'There is no planet B "and one in Spanish, saying" the Earth said that she has enough ". 
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including the top model and photographer Danish, Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the country home of his mother, Peru, opened our eyes on the difficult problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change already occurring. " 
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march - of spreading the word and to launch an appeal to the leaders of the world to take the right decisions, ambitious and committed, "she said. 
This is not an easy task, but it must be carried out, it is no longer possible to avoid it. 
The police prevented the protesters to come too close to the centre Bella and said that it had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they wore a mask or that they were in possession of knives. 
The police prevented the protesters to come too close to the centre Bella and said that it had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they wore a mask or that they were in possession of knives. 
According to a bystander who asked to remain anonymous because of its involvement in discussions on the climate, the activists who were wearing masks and black clothing, sparked several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is surrounded by a few departments. 
They now almost buildings, he said, adding that they were first rocket, followed by "a few big explosions ". 
Within the Palace of Congress, people gathered around television screens to follow the march, throughout the afternoon. 
But it seems that the demonstrators have failed to awaken the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, China representative for the climate. 
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied In English "In fact, this is something that I did not realise. 
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "The event is important, I cannot hear what is happening outside." 
He observed that the march could be harmful or helpful perspective. 
It shows the interest of the public and of different sectors on the subject of climate change, "he said. 
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or destroying the freedom of others." 
The results of the tests reveal persistent differences between the races 
The federal report last week on the results in mathematics has made a good news for public schools in Washington d. c. 
Although the District is still far behind the facilities, the report shows that the Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1 - cm2) are much more in the last two years in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York. 
But the latest figures from the national assessment of Educational progress (national assessment of the progress of education) is the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and white, both local and national. 
The scores of white children of Grade 4 (cm1) to washingtond. C. have increased over the last two years, from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their classmates Afro-américaines grew by only three points, from 209 to 212. 
The gap of success has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points. 
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4 th) remains generally constant, falling just one point, from 245 to 244. 
The result means of whites has not been included in the results of the tests because the sample was not important enough. 
The overview over a period of six years is not more encouraging. 
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in class of Grade 4 (cm1), when the first report of the NAEP District was published, was 60 points (262 to 202). 
Although the results achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference is only reduced to 58 points. 
Last week, some defenders in the District have expressed concern that rising celebrated by the Director of group of educational institutions Michelle a. Rhee and Mayor, Adrian Mr Fenty (Democratic) were powered by white students who were already good elements. 
This would mean that we have high aggregate in recital at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of d. c. Voice, a nonprofit group that promotes equality in education in the District. 
I do not immediately of joy for one or two points earned, said Kwame r. Brown (related democrat), Member of the Council of d. c. and whose daughter is in Grade 4, Eaton elementary (elementary school). 
Often critical of the management style of Rhee, Brown said that the message of the results of tests is that the middle schools (colleges) of the city desperately need attention. 
Really, you always see the positive signs and I respect that. 
But the fear is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges). 
Rhee said that the District should continue to find better ways to respond to the needs of students in difficulty. 
This autumn, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson reading System, schoolchildren classes to end the cycle elementary and beginning of college which did not include the foundations of the reading earlier in their qualifications and which are lagging behind their peers. 
Every day, the programme of mathematics, for the classes of Kindergarten (mother) to Grade 6 (6 th) focuses on the games and the experiences of real life, as they have been put in place in the District by former responsible Clifford Janey, which must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week. 
I simply believe that we must continue to work to provide better interventions to these students from the class, said Rhee. 
Others believe that the results of the NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less good results in order to reduce the gap. 
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of education at the University of California Berkeley who studied the results of tests of cities. 
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington. 
Also this targeting can have political repercussions this important program. 
But the problem, of course, is that as the other Superintendant schools, she is trying to use the middle class whites and blacks. 
We focus for the development of a system of good schools. 
We must strengthen our schools districts so that all families, regardless of where they come from, should be confident that their children can obtain an excellent public education. 
Janey, now Superintendant schools of Newark, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap of success étaitla duration of traditional public school, today to 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with the Charter schools. 
It takes about 200 days to change, said Janey, which came to an agreement with the union of school last year for 185 days, which it considers a "starting point" for even an increase in the next contract.

Super This is where I shall study! has exclaimed Graciela who wish to study medicine, while the guide the ran towards the entrance of science. 
Youpi, really? "she says food for thought, when he made it the low ratio law professor - student. 
The university of Pennsylvania was the seventh that were visiting children during their journey of discovery of three days and now they had completely integrated the message: the question is not whether you are going to university: 
The question is where. 
Although this question is still largely for the large number of American children born to parents Hispanic immigrants who have left the high school where have become parents to adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to university education to enter the middle class. 
In fact, "a Hispanic to the" second generation "on cinqpoursuit attended grammar school - a notable considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, entered the U.S. without having completed high school. 
Their success is important, say researchers, they pave the way for future generations who will play an important role in the country. 
Researchers who study fighters claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed. 
There are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find the means to compensate for their lack of familiarity with the American schools. 
The mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children as she arrived to university - in particular, if its efforts are regular and long-term. 
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, does not help, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who has studied Latin American students. 
We must think to offer a network of support for these children, in kindergarten through high school. 
The federal program that has funded the visit of universities of Graciela is a good example. 
Known as the IRG up (prépares you), it provides more than $300 million per year to systems of local schools to organize the programs at the university who begin when students from low-income families are in middle practical (College) and continue until the end of years of school. 
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent going to university, according to the United States Department of Education. 
The Iraqi oil ministry agreements with 10 foreign oil companies 
Despite the concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auction that ended Saturday. 
The 10 agreements reached by the Ministry of Iraqi oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are poised to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil industry from Iraq, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions. 
American companies are reparties with participation in only two of 10 fields auctioned. 
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday. 
The only one who had an auction has lost. 
Two U.S. companies have obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June. 
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts. 
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, are of Asian and European companies who are leading the way, "said Ruba Husari, editor of the forum Iraq Oil forum, a site of information on the Internet. 
It will take a lot of time before another offer is made in Iraq. 
The concerns about security, corroborated by massive coordinated bombardments, Tuesday, and political instability, while the U.S. military troops withdraw have slowed down the American oil companies, preventing them from entering with greater force in Iraq, which has the third largest reserves of crude oil in the world, say analysts. 
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged by their rivals, in particular the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they had not accountable to shareholders. 
Exxon-mobil and Occidental Petroleum inc. have been the only American companies to obtain contracts with the department. 
American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who had strong ties with the Ministry of Iraqi oil and have brought their technical advice, are reparties empty-handed. 
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend. 
The Chinese National Petroleum corp., owned by the state, has more enchéri on contracts that other companies and is left with significant holdings in contracts for two main fields. 
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, "said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Department of oil. 
We are confident that Chinese society will be on an equal footing with its competitors and realise its commitments in Iraq. 
The pré-sélectionnées corporations to submit auctions have made offers which were then compared to the tariff per barrel that the department agrees to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field. 
One of the main organisers al-Qaeda would have been killed in Pakistan 
It seems that an American missile, having struck along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organisers of al-Qaeda, this week, said Friday of the U.S. authorities of espionage. 
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this autumn. 
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car, on Tuesday, near the town of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region. 
Local authorities have said that the missiles had been fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA, in the tribal border of Pakistan. 
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was struck, said a member of the secret services Pakistani civilians, speaking by telephone from Miran Shah. 
The authorities have said that the local militant suspects fled into place and quickly confiscated what was left of "totally torn-apart body ". 
It was completely impossible to local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two representatives counter-terrorism American gave evidence that unspecified Somali was among the dead. 
Somali was described as one of the organizers Officers al-Qaeda military led the terrorist group's operations outside of the jirga region. 
His role was to organize conspiracies in the world, "said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the air strikes inside Pakistani territory. 
Given its central role, this was probably the conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe. 
It followed the strategic leaders of al-Qaeda and has translated into action plans for further terrorist attacks. 
A second representative of the American authority said that Somali had progressed rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaida' and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region. 
It is perhaps not known to the general public, but this does not diminish the threat it poses for us and our allies, "said the second official. 
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important al-Qaeda or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators. 
The pace of attacks carried out by unmanned CIA has decreased since the summer, approximately six operations by two months, according to the figures put forward by the Long War Journal, a Web site tempered by a moderate group. 
This decline is perhaps due to improved tactics of terrorist groups who have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while killing also ruthlessly the suspected informants, says the site. 
The U.N. special envoy in Kabul withdraws 
The U.N. special envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of corruption spread during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations. 
The departure of Eide comes at a time when the Obama administration has decided to send 30 000 additional troops in Afghanistan. 
The U.N. envoy has said that he supported this increase, but he expressed his concern about the U.S. timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and the other governments of NATO to withdraw their forces. 
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, to send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul. 
Our commitment must be long-term. 
The Norwegian diplomat has also urged the U.S. and other military powers to increase the number of international staff helping the political transition in Afghanistan. 
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said. 
Eide said he did not resign but that it would respect the commitment he had made to his family, in March, to spend two years in Kabul. 
He said that he wanted to prevent the United Nations. 
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement. 
I simply said that it was better to start tracing my replacement, Eide said. 
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the start of my predecessor and my arrival. 
According to the representatives of the United Nations, Ban has already begun to look for a replacement. 
The representatives argue that the name of Staffan di Mistura was quoted; it is a citizen Italo-Suisse which recently chaired an United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously headed the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations. 
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy, Peter w. Galbraith, accused, in September, President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and to conceal evidence of massive electoral fraud. 
Eide denied the allegations but he said that the accusations of Galbraith - who has been thanked - "have damaged the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism as regards the international observation of éléctions ". 
Eide said that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of American forces in Afghanistan. 
He also urged Officers of the United Nations to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that it is assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence about how their money is spent. 
Eide has expressed his frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy regulations of hiring the United Nations impeded its opportunities to bring new talent. 
The rules of the United Nations are such that I could not recruit only one person since May, he said. 
It is appalling and it cannot continue. 
Gates: The Iran must undergo additional sanctions 
The Secretary of Defense Robert m. Gates said Friday that world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions. 
Gates, speaking before a forum of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a visit to a week in the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has dédramatisé the possibility of military action against the Islamic republic. 
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such an outcome. 
One of the things that strikes me the most is that if I have learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictable inherent in the war. 
The Obama administration considers a range of sanctions targeting the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has said that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians to the streets. 
He said that a "package of incentives and punishments" might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact less good security with nuclear weapons "because" its people would suffer greatly 'of these sanctions. 
On Friday, in a statement from the spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined the European leaders in warning that Iran will face consequences "probable" if it does not reduce its nuclear programme in full compliance with the U.N. Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Energy Agency (IAEA). 
Iran continues to say that he wants to develop its nuclear experience only in a peaceful purpose. 
In the talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would take the dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agree to give up a substantial part of its storage of enriched uranium, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor. 
The administration has prompted such an agreement, way to develop a confidence on both sides and to win time for negotiations. 
Since then, Iran appears to be attempts - in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not with the United States. 
Frankly, in my view, the inflexibility of Iran to the proposals of the international community for which they had in fact given their agreement at the beginning of October, prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join on what they had not considered, in terms of important additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said. 
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before he turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called 'sanctions'. 
In a statement Thursday in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations has denounced what it calls "baseless allegations" of some members of the Security Council on nuclear activities of Iran and said that it was agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to obtain a satisfactory solution in the long term ". 
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington late on Friday, met in the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the oil rich region of Kurdish to derencontrer Display troops to Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil. 
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly concerning the borders, property rights and the sharing of revenues. 
Gates has urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid delays of U.S. plans to reduce the number of American troops, from 115 000 to 50 000 before the end of August. 
Gates also wants to calm the anxiety of Kurds concerning the withdrawal outstanding. The U.S. authorities have quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the regional government of Kurdistan: "We safeguard your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within an unified Iraq ". 
We will not abandon you. " 
In China ageing, a change of direction 
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda poster the lecturing, "the mother earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "a baby, this is a more ". 
They have learned the lesson that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the rate of birth of their city and the ageing of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their response has been instantaneous and firm: never. 
We have already given all our time and energy to one child. 
There is no second, said Wang, 31 years, Director of human resources and who has a son of 8 months. 
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of children with unique notoriously good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed the "little emperors ", a population crisis threatens the country. 
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1,8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented. 
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over, off 16,7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31,1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the global average of about 20 percent. 
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a population highly educated, such as Shanghai. 
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple. 
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of the Population Municipale Shanghai and the Planning Familial) said that the fertile couples to have babies in order "to help reduce the proportion of the ageing Population and prevent a lack of manpower in the future." 
Shanghai is on the verge of becoming "too old - but not as rich, however, that the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said. 
A gradual easing 
In the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is to this day, without doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the Communist government. 
Couples who transgress this policy might have to pay huge fines - up to three times their annual income - and of discrimination in the workplace. 
The Chinese authorities have attributed to police the duty to help the country to avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while lawyers of human rights have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy. 
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced pregnant women a second child to have an abortion. 
In addition, many couples have used the selective abortions leading to a ratio boys - girls abnormally high. 
In recent years, the authorities of the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy. 
In 2004, they have given more exceptions to the rule - including for residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which the man and woman are already children unique - and in 2007, they have softened much of their slogans hard. 
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research (Research Institute on the Population), at the University of Beijing, said that the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child. 
In July, Shanghai has become the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births. 
In no time, the posters urging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of regulations retailer who has the right to have a second child and how to make the request for authorisation. 
The government of the city has sent the family planning and volunteers to meet couples, to their homes, and prospectus under their door. 
He has also promised to provide financial and psychological advice to those who would like to have more than one child. 
According to the family planning, the answer has been disappointing. 
Disappointing response 
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples wishing to a second child after the launch of the campaign, the district more urban reported that there was no change. 
The common Huinan, with a population of 115 000, for example, is always that four to five requests per month. 
Those responsible for Shanghai, disappointed, said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be about 165 000 - slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008. 
Feng Juying, Officer of the committee of family planning in the municipality of Caolu Shanghai, said that the financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children. 
They want to cater to their first child, she said. 
Yang Jiawei, 27 years and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years, said they adoreraient having two children and that they are legally allowed. 
But like many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life assurance given by the government. 
Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible. 
The Western mistakenly see that the one-child policy is a problem of rights, "said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child. 
It is true, we are stealing the chance to have more than one child. 
But the problem is not only the law. 
It is money. 
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation. 
Wang, Officer of human resources, said she wanted a single child because it was an itself. "we were the centre of the family and used that everyone cares." 
We have not in the habit of taking care of someone else and we really do not want to take care of others. " 
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a society of translation says more bluntly. 
For working couples to two, middle class, which restrict the birth rate, he says, we must be selfish pourbien succeed. 
The people of 20 or 30 years have grown up seeing their parents fight in the early days of China capitalist and do not want to have themselves this way of life, "he says. 
Even one child asks a lot of time of his parents, he said. 
A mother must abandon at least two years of his life. 
And then there are the problems of space - "there you must change your apartment" - and planning - "When your child has only 9 months, you need to write his CV for a place in the best mother." 
Most of his friends are ready to this experience once, said Chen, but not two. 
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, "he says. 
We do not want to make too many sacrifices. 
The Group of the United Nations has projects plans for reducing emissions 
The climate conference, sponsored by the United nations - characterised by OPTEMPO disrupted and mutual recriminations - is back in the spotlight Friday, due to the publication of a document outlining the ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with the industrialised nations supporting most of the burden in the coming years. 
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, has highlighted the remaining obstacles, as much as he has informed the path to take. 
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that are short of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving next week in Copenhagen. 
Compiled by a special working group of the United Nations, the text does not say how many rich countries would give to the poor to cope with global warming, and long-term. 
And it offers a wide range of options for the key issues, including how the developed economies and the emerging economies new could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature that those responsible would be prepared to tolerate. 
It gives a great deal of flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, Representative àWashington Sierra Club. 
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has written six pages of the document, has studied a text of negotiations of 180 pages to focus on what has described the Secretary-General executive on climate change, Yvo de Boer, as the "full picture ". 
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations collectively reduce their emissions in 2020, from 25 to 45 percent from 1990 levels, while the main developing countries, during the same period, would reduce emissions by 15 to 30 percent. 
Together, the countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent for 2050. 
The European Union has also relaunched the negotiations, on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change - to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation. 
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercation occurred, who have dominated the negotiations since last week. 
Todd Stern, Representative of the United States to the negotiating climate has rejected any discussion obliging the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialised countries, compared with the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed countries. 
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming harder to China that the Bush administration has been, two years ago. 
The U.S. will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of the major developing countries, said Stern who also regretted that the text does not enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers. 
Stern has made his comments one hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, He Yafei has said that the chief U.S. negotiator, is a lack of "common sense ", was" extremely irresponsible "for having said earlier in the week that the U.S. would help not financially China to combat global warming. 
With economic future of the world's major powers at stake, defects are both within and between the industrial world and the emerging economies. 
The current battle is more to the rescue of individual economies that the rescue of the planet, with China and the U.S. destroyed on their respective obligations while poorer nations insist on the fact that the two dozen countries most influential ignore imperatives scientists to act more boldly. 
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in their attempt to make the big emitters accountable for their actions. 
It really is a game in which has developed a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, which is also advising on the climate for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International. 
Some of these countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants said that the negotiations will lead to a minimum, a political agreement. 
The Alliance of Home Member Insulaires which brings together 43 members, has drafted a proposal of 24 pages of treaty, early Friday morning. 
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the climate unit of the European Commission, said that the action of the small island states has "put political pressure on the political process complete ", in part by what they are now unified and ask the emerging economies such as China and India, to act. 
The debates have become a matter of urgency, while delegates were centred on the fact that they should solve most problems pending before the heads of government come to an agreement. 
The high-level officials such as the Minister of the Environment, Jairam Ramesh Indian and Chinese Vice-ministre venting their plane and rushed into the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings behind closed doors and conferences of information, in order to make claims that will be discussed during the following week. 
The real image of the rally - in which 13 000 people enter and leave the conference every day - activists guitar players are performances night mocking of countries that they will betray and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by emails - is a real challenge. 
The intensity is growing: almost all the ministers are here and not later than on Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen. 
We are entering the big boys, "said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the global policy of Conservation International. 
Lorries arrive. 
In Britain, the first train to 225 km/h will redefine the syndrome Monday 
5 p. m., Monday morning, a whistle will come the night to announce the departure of a train that will mark a revolution in transport in Britain. 
The first high-speed commuter train the country will reach 225 km / h, whereas it filera of Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes. 
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes aboard the first commuter train Javelin outside London. 
He hoped that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast trains and reliable and will link large conurbations Midlands, North and of Scotland in London. 
The small holes will become lost cities of booming suburb, interscan business travel will be much less long and the passage of the plane and the car at the train will reduce emissions of carbon while reducing congestion on the roads. 
In theory, the three main political parties adhering to this project. 
But the ten billion needed to build a new rail network, the battle of planning inevitable and fears of dangers to the environment may curb high-speed lines. 
According to the Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to achieve for the government a feasibility report, will make his document to Lord Adonis on 30 December. 
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage for the high-speed network. 
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn up within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial. 
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres of the final. 
It is also expected that HS2 has three options for a high-speed network more, to the north. 
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring. 
The options are highlighted in a configuration in Y for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands. 
The line will separate into two at or near Birmingham, with a branch from west of Pennines àManchester and Scotland and another to the north-east, Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne. 
A single line through Scotland. 
"it seems that this will be the best option of performance 'said a professional rail. 
When this is over, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes. 
The first part, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a trip to a hour. 
The proposals will allow the train travelling at 400 km / h, making the British network the fastest in the world. 
The initial route is designed to allow trains to 400 m long and can carry 1100 people. 
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a line from London to Birmingham. 
A terminal capacity of 20000 passengers per hour would be necessary. 
In data the constraints of space, it is anticipated that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network. 
The rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility. 
Lord Adonis announce whether or not he feels that the project must be put in place, but public consultations longer and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election. 
Even if it launches the machine, the network will be built by. 
The trains will be forced to drive out of high-speed lines on the existing track north of Birmingham, maintaining journey times between London and Scotland more than three hours. 
This seems to be the best to ensure a way of trains, a reference point for the revolution. 
We taxpayers pay back the loan of GBP 75.000 for the orangerie of Tory 
Alan Duncan, senior Tory member of parliament, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to repay the cost of an orangerie he has built house in his constituency. 
The party that has been demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were "met ", has increased its loan of GBP 75.000 to build an extension in oak at its second homes, in Rutland. 
He had been allowed to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer. 
The authorities have received complaints at the time and have not been asked by Sir Thomas Legg, who is on a control of expenditure States. Last night, Mr Duncan said that the complaints could be "clearer or more simple." 
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, is the owner of a two-tier house in a village in his constituency in Rutland - Melton. 
The surrounding houses have been sold for nearly £ million. 
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and dining room, but the office of salary asserts that Mr Duncan needed more space. 
Last year, he added a véranda at home, describing in its plans as an orangeraie. 
Neighbours have described it as a "véranda for pleasure ". 
It has not been asked Mr Duncan to give an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee of Privileges and standards of the Commons, on its loan provisions. 
The Committee has cleared last month of any accusation of non-compliance with the rules, after an investigation into his expenses. 
In 2004, Mr Duncan has changed the legal certainty of borrowing of GBP 271.406 of his property from London to his constituency house he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament. 
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan called for approximately GBP 1.400 per month interest loan until March of last year. 
In April, its applications have increased by more than GBP 1.800 per month. 
The interest rate on the loan RBS of Mr Duncan has not been changed at this time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the loan of GBP 75.000. 
The interest rate standard variable RBS rose from 7,94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, nothing since then. 
The latest publication of the Commons' authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to ask GBP 1.250 in May. 
Mr Duncan has lost his position of Officer of the shadow cabinet in September, after a journalist on the supposedly filmed saying that members of parliament were to survive "on budget" after the expenses scandal. 
"in fact, it is now national, you have to live" on budget "and you are treated as" of the m... " 
He said: "I have spent my money on my garden and I asked for a small part, based on what was correct. 
And I could demand a damn more, but I did not do. " 
The Member of Parliament, millionaire since his former position Franquelin oil, began to explain its expenditure, in May, after it emerged that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden before agreeing with the fees office that it "could be considered excessive ". 
An activist has been a hole in the form of £in Mr Duncan, the lawn in protest after it was revealed that he had asked GBP 4.000 for three years. 
Asked about the increase in borrowing, last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was for improvements capitals, approved by the fees office then by Legg." 
He added: "There is no problem of evasion or preparation or the use of rules or anything. 
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorised, etc. 
This could not be clearer or more simple. " 
True, all just to see the advent calendar of Brighton 
The Brighton beach have found a new way of promotion for the winter months, a timetable of Advent interactive. 
Beyond, a group of church alternative which encourages exploration spiritual by creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cab for each day of December, using as the theme, songs of Noel. 
The event began on 1 December, when the visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 17 pm to 18 p. m., every day, with patés and wine served hot free of charge. 
The songs of Noel selected so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and the First Christmas ", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist. 
Martin Poole, 50, an assistant marketing of TV Hove, is a priest unpaid of the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.

We were told that it was a massacre. 
Surgeons of Los Angeles said they were outraged, "said Mr. Camus.

To support its approach, he has received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP NC) which claims ownership of the brand UDF for having been the first to the table in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property. 
But Friday evening, the office of the association UDF, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to lose, has emerged from its silence to launch a formal notice to the Minister and the MP, instructing them not to use the acronym and to convey the property of the brand, under penalty of prosecution. 
You have multiplied, these days, the statements that you would suggest to your political movement of + resume the acronym UDF, writing the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, François Bayrou and Mrs de Sarnez the MoDem party, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis Alliance centrist. 
You have also seen fit to follow on your militant equipment and on page of your site, the name of this movement, the of the slogan, New + the UDF today, also see the signatories of the letter. 
As you know, you have no right to the use of the acronym, explains the UDF which remains the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF of any medium and (his) website ". 
It also calls on Mr Hervé de Charette "to convey the property of (the) brand to its legitimate UHMs ". 
If you do not, would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, prevent the signatories. 
In their letter, they stipulate that the UDF "is a political movement fully-fledged policy since 1978" and that Mr Morin and his friends had "chosen" to leave in 2007 "to create a competitor, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP ". 
The New centre has therefore, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French democracy). 
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 his MoDem party for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. 
As for Mr Hervé de Charette, said the office, "when he has the mark ", it was" more acceding to the UDF for three years, "but the UMP. 
It benefits scandalously and fraudulently to the abscence ACTCS acronym UDF for it. 
This brutality is turning into crime, dénoncent-ils, before to mock on the strategy of the NC: "It seems that in politics, as in life, It is more to make a name for themselves that to try to get out of the anonymity by fraudulently a name which was not entitled ". 
Case Lilian Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness 
The Nanterre tribunal decided Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine if, as in accuses the daughter of the billionaire Lilian Bettencourt, it has benefited from a state of weakness to the -year-old for the theft of a part of his fortune. 
The photographer for 62 years, known for his photographs of stars, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 to abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment and a fine of €375.000. 
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families of France, in which a mother and daughter are squabbling while taking the reins of the cosmetics empire the L'Oreal. 
But the 15th chamber correctional has also ordered a medical expertise of Lilian Bettencourt, aged 87, should be carried out collectively by three doctors. 
The heir and main shareholder of the L'Oreal has always refused to submit to such a review, at least not in the conditions proposed by the prosecutor of Nanterre during the investigation. 
Doctors designated Friday will be required to submit a report before 10 March 2010 by saying whether Lilian Bettencourt could find themselves in a state of weakness and at what times. 
I think it will. 
I am, "said the lawyer at the hearing of Mrs Bettencourt, mr. Georges Kiejman. 
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, mr. Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the court. 
This is excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Mr Banier) has manipulated her grandmother that we must protect, he said. 
For two years, the daughter of Lilian Bettencourt has initiated criminal prosecution against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist meddling, which it accuses of having benefited for years from the weakness of his mother for a billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, insurance contracts or tables of masters. 
For its part, Lilian Bettencourt has always refuted have been manipulated by the photographer, as a friend. 
While the court should examine the admissibility of the action taken by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the pleadings of lawyers have at times been naming family Friday. 
Thus, counsel of Lilian Bettencourt indicated three letters sent by his client (1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which she said is suspicious of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers. 
In the letter dated 2003, Lilian Bettencourt added, according to counsel: "could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years. 
Françoise, I have never been able to speak to him since his marriage ". 
For its part, the prosecutor in Nanterre has estimated that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially as a judge of the Guardianship refused in recent days to grant his request to open a procedure of judicial protection for his mother. 
Lilian Bettencourt "has full capacity to act, it is not under protection and has no guardian. 
Nobody else has to act in its place, "said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney. 
The court decided that it would decide once the trial has taken place on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers. 
Revolution managerial or end of economic intelligence? 
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain … 
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of big business to its employees, recalls the position of the business to consumer marketing before the revolution marketing: it is to join the staff to "values" determined from on high as it was in the past, to impose consumer products designed by the technicians of the plant. 
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the revolution has delivered the marketing strategies of conquest of markets to... Although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected factors of preferences of clienteles return regularly! 
A demobilization of employees can lead to demoralization deadly. 
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon which affects in particular executives. 
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including the R and, more importantly, the economic intelligence. 
Indeed, the EIs "requires of all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision "; it requires a commitment on the part of employees that revenue management authoritarian bedevil completely. 
That is why we are calling for a revolution managerial to set the staff at the centre of the concerns of the company as well as the customer. 
The usefulness of internal polls 
Internal polls as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salariés- will incite the revolution in the managerial practices? 
Unfortunately, I am afraid not. 
- Firstly because I have seen that, in a new situation, any structure finally, after many detours, priority … what it has always done.! 
- Secondly, because the authoritarianism - of pathologies of punishable grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures. 
- Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic vision of human behaviour. 
J-F-C engineers, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology. 
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old theory behavioriste, cranked up recently by the "neuroscience" American and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the Institutes of studies and the media. 
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to use the "levers" (sic) of the commitment of executives, a recent survey of Ipsos appeared in the figaro. Fr conforte-t-elle leaders in a position of governance mechanistic, inadequate in today's world. 
Identify and measure the factors of mobilisation 
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies to adopt a final vision of human behaviour. 
It is to include, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it becomes clear as a means to achieve their dreams, their ambitions, of their projects. 
Currently, only studies from the TBFRA motifonctionnelle adopt this design of the motivations of employees. 
These studies have shown that they believe their company based on a doxa predetermined which, through their perceived image of the company, to assess what Coneco offers to achieve their life plans. 
Thanks to the identification and to the extent of these factors, business managers can control, and anticipate their "social" and their management of human resources "to ". 
They create a breeding ground for concerted development of a robust economic intelligence and effective. 
Oslo speech: "just war" is on the right to Obama 
The American right has welcomed Friday the speech in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States. 
The Conservatives, who had brocardé awarding the prize to Mr Obama on 9 October, applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, a former candidate for the vice-presidency in the 2008 elections. 
I liked what he said, "said Mrs Palin, égérie of the right wing of the Republican Party daily, USA Today programme, adding she herself mentioned the subject of war" sometimes necessary "war in his memoirs that have just been published. 
The war is, the last thing in my view that the Americans want to do, but it is necessary. 
We must stop these terrorists everything out there, "she said. 
Mr Obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George w. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, has worked Thursday to Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain its decision to send 30.000 additional troops in Afghanistan nine days earlier. 
Another opponent of Mr Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done in Oslo "a very good job ". 
I found that the speech was really very well, welcomed the former chairman of the House of Representatives, which has particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential. 
By some side, I found it quite historic, "said mr. Gingrich, interviewed in the broadcasting" the Takeaway ". 
The former elected, regarded by some as a possible contender for the Republican nomination for the presidential election of 2012, said he was delighted to have seen a "leftist" remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could put a price on peace if the use of force did not exist ". 
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George w. Bush converted in the Washington Post, Mr Obama has made a speech "very American." 
In addition to present in "citizen of the world" as "it always "," he spoke as an American president, "reminding Europeans' that they live in a bubble of security that they have not created and that they do little to preserve biodiversity," said Mr Gerson. 
Among the few to right to not be convinced, a hawk Commissioner of the Bush era, the former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, has described the speech "dull, turgid and without inspiration" on the National Review Online. 
Has the left of the president, the representative Democrat Dennis Kucinich has alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force. 
When funding the war within the concept of justice, can easily justify the massacre of innocent people, "he warned. 
The center-left press was flattering however to the president. 
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr Obama, described his speech "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent. 
The Oslo "should serve as a road map to guide decisions against international conflicts, poverty and oppression," has inflamed the Californian. 
Mr Obama "has made the speech that ", said the New York Times, deeming it" both dark and inspiring ". 
Road: three marathons for an agreement that rescues supplies of Christmas 
After three sessions of négociations-marathon, the unions in the road sector and TLF employers' organisation, only to be stayed until the end, arrived Friday evening at an agreement that puts an end to the strike and the threat to supplies of Christmas. 
At the meeting of signatures on Friday evening, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "delighted" of this agreement, after several sessions of negotiations, launched on Wednesday morning. 
After a second night of discussions the negotiators were left in the early morning Friday, with the hope of quickly sign at the end of the morning the text agree. 
Even if three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door. 
But it took more than six hours of a meeting started at 11 noon for everyone to agree and that, at 18 noon the text is signed. 
The conflict "would have been very damaging for the companies' and 'it was feared that it will disrupt the Christmas," said Mr Bussereau. 
The text provides a wage increases of 4% for the lowest wages (in road transport local and regional), and 2,9% for the highest (international). 
In hourly rate, for the bas-salaires, "we have gone from EUR 8,72 to 9,06. 
It is not much, but it is very far, "said Patrice Clos (FO). 
It will give the order to our activists that there are no barriers, no blockade of centres of supplies. 
But we can always have some recalcitrant who are not happy, he added. 
Philippe Grillot, chairman of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement," even if it was "difficult to concede the increases on the higher salaries because of international competition ". 
According to him, the increases will be of the order of EUR 170 per month for low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest. 
It is the agreement of common sense and respect of employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (Company) has hailed a "historic agreement ". 
Richard Jaubert (CGT) has mentioned "an acceptable compromise." 
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel costs of 3%, and the holding of general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will address the issue of a 13th month and modernisation of the collective agreement. 
Mr Bussereau said that "a drop of 100 million euros of employer contributions" has been the subject of an amendment to the government finance bill amending for 2009, voted Thursday night by the National Assembly. 
The government will ask the Senate to vote "identical ". 
The signing of TLF allows the agreement applies initially businesses adhérentes to this organization, and in a second time, to the entire profession, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour. 
It will be "as soon as possible," assured Mr Bussereau. 
The opposition of employers' organisations can only delay the process. 
The FNTR denounced a "fool's bargain ", because the EUR 100 million" had already been promised for the sector to offset a portion of the carbon tax. " 
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in the urgency, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to thwart the eaters of turkey next partying, has deplored the Unostra. 
For the Otre, the agreement risk "to dig the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months ". 
RER A: disruption this weekend, trade unions unhappy with the proposals of the RATP 
The disruption on the RER a, the biggest line of urban public transport of France, will continue during the weekend, when a meeting Friday the 2th day of strike between unions and management of the RATP left hanging on to their demand for premium. 
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend shopping before Christmas, there will be trains between 10 noon and 20 noon, a train on two on the central section (between Defence and Nation) and a train on four outside the central section. 
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Préfecture, which will force passengers to change. 
The Galeries Lafayette, who expect 200.000 clients every day, were happy that "the RATP making efforts to serve department stores ". 
The RER A crosses from west to east agglomeration Paris. 
The RATP short of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée. 
Friday, about a train on two was circulated at peak times, and almost no rowing in off-peak, as planned. 
As on Thursday, there was no melee on the quays, the Franciliens has organized. 
In the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, particularly because of the absence of pupils and students. 
Has Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer of 29 years, due to be lifted "a hour and a half earlier, to be sure to arrive on time ". 
The station Saint-Lazare has not experienced saturation, "said the SNCF, which provided guidance to officers and security forces. 
The RER A made by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut or started from the station Saint-Lazare to join the subways. 
New general meetings of strikers will be held Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, deemed "meagre" by the trade unions, a meeting with management on Friday afternoon. 
The Director of PRRs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER an on all aspects, working time, service career etc. 
This is not what the drivers, who are calling for a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South). 
The RATP puts even its proposals for premium incidentally, has outraged the CGT, stressing that the direction "was not kaput to resolve a problem while in the road and the SNCF is done. 
A new meeting is scheduled Monday for "a wider review of conditions for the exercise of the profession," said the RATP. 
What has also told unions that the company "scoffed users weekend ". 
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a committee of establishment at headquarters in Paris. 
That is when the direction, which until then refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in a spirit of appeasement" the meeting. 
The conflict threatens to widen the RER B Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents. 
The unions are demanding a bonus of 120 euros (Unsa) to EUR 150 and EUR 30 variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on that line the million daily passengers. 
Drivers of RER, all in the second part of career, affect 2.200 to EUR 2.700 gross and 600 to 650 euros of bonuses, for off-shifting, Sundays and holidays. 
The Turkish justice dissolved the pro-Kurdish, decision with serious consequences 
The Turkish Constitutional Court said Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish, a decision which was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul. 
This decision may complicate the task of the government, which has just reach out to the Kurdish community to end 25 years of conflict. 
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "home of activities prejudicial to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said the press the President of the Court Hasim Kiliç, at the end of four days of deliberations. 
The decision was taken to the unanimity of the 11 judges, even though a qualified majority of votes was required to make the dissolution, Mr Kiliç said, adding that 37 party officials, including its President Ahmet Türk and the Member Aysel Tugluk, are banned from politics for five years. 
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity granted to Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation of assets by the Treasury. 
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550). 
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that Members leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without label. 
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP to obey "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many countries. 
Many observers believe that the DTP is the showcase legal policy of PKK rebels. 
The party maintains that it was "no illusion" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him. 
The verdict of the Court comes at a time when the government is to reach out to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to stem the support of the PKK and put an end the conflict. 
The DTP leaders said that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in the south-east anatolien, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks. 
In the immediate aftermath of justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the south-eastern city populated by majority of Kurds. 
Police fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators were launching molotov cocktails or stones, with slingshots ran amok. 
A hundred people also marched in Istanbul. 
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of Justice "deepen the despair ". 
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, night-glasses) by banning a party, "he said to the press. 
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision. 
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties. 
It does not solve anything, "said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz. 
This decision is a total torpedoing of democratic openness launched by the government, commented on the political analyst Ahmet Insel. 
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added. 
On Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months. 
The new "Silicon-valley" 
For a long time it had the reputation of city secret, banned Western visitors. 
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was under the Soviet regime, a place of research secret arms, under strict supervision. 
Today with its 216 000 inhabitants to 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the policy has the reputation of being the Soviet "Silicon Valley ". 
Important places of production and research in micro- and nanoelectronics are located. 
By September 2008 representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, place of science francfortois - with university institutes and societies in the centre of innovations in Frankfurt (FIZ). 
Mutual meetings reciprocal last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg have ratified a "Protocol of close collaboration ". 
The signatories were the Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwartz section head project for Frankfurt. 
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will Zelenograd for a seminar. 
Exchange scientific 
It is a scientific exchange. 
But also of economic relations. 
It will allow the companies FIZ to enter the booming Russian market. 
Has the opposite companies Russian scientists want to obtain contracts in Germany. 
Zelenograd is the seat of research institutes and companies Soviet famous. 
There are Institute electrical engineering of Moscow, the big firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika. 
The common was founded in 1958 as "socialist planned city planned for research. 
Zelenograd (literal translation City "green ") bears the name of wooded hills at the heart of which research centres are located. 
The project S21: a brake for Stuttgart 
We cannot put high enough the scale of the project Stuttgart 21. 
For its supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe ". 
If you want to. s21, it is much more that burying a railway station, more than a huge construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, in a chaos of yards for a decade. 
Stuttgart 21 was born of the spirit of the 80 s. 
The stations head of line, with routes which lasted till in the middle of the city, had a reputation at the time to be the relics of the technical transport nineteenth century that were effect of cloven hoof of brake rail traffic modern because it was once a long time to get the locomotives of back to before. 
Arrival, stopping short, start - it is what needs to be done. 
That is why the stations head of line must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich. 
And Stuttgart also: a station of passage of trains, which lies halfway around on the construction Transeuropéenne rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava where the slogan "heart of Europe ". 
The project S21 will really begin, although the visions of the 80 s are longer compatible with reality. 
Even the most ambitious planners have acknowledged that the cost, to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant. 
Indeed, the head of line stations are more real problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with autorails and voiture-pilote at both ends. 
However, it is now the achievement of Stuttgart 21 next to the new route of the line inter-city towards Ulm. 
The regional and local prevailed. 
The railways is part of the mix, because it is the taxpayer the costs of the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public company. 
From the point of view clearly this project is relatively well justified. 
Creating an urban space which - according to the charts planners generated by computer - will be very keeps. 
For the system of rail transport the S21 is harmful. 
The station and the enlargement of the section are designed for a trafficking of people were - and this is typical of the 80 s - an enormous growth. 
At the time there was not yet competition from cheap flights. 
The modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening the traffic of goods for transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road. 
But the new route, with its leanings, is not appropriate to freight trains. 
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects. 
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the draft of the Souabe. 
It is the official figure. 
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic. 
One thing is certain, in the next decade the money involved for other points and congestion in the network. 
The list of the Department of Transportation mentions in all major projects. 
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section through the Rhine valley of 180 square kilometres. 
Since 1987 the line is built. 
It would be really urgent support here to build on the fungus. 
But the project S21 a cloven hoof braking. 
The route of the Rhine valley is becoming the bottleneck of international freight traffic, and this in the heart of Europe. 
The Government is considering the judgement on the airport 
Parliament regional Wiesbaden, the national government has raised the possibility of appeal to the Court Administratif of Hesse regarding the prohibition of night flights. 
The Minister of the Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU / FDP coalition had entrusted experts to examine the legal point of view the ruling by the Court Administratif and which is a document containing more than 400 pages. 
The Tribunal of Kassel was justified in writing that the state should adapt the regulation concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction of the runway aterrissage north-west of Frankfurt airport would be fulfilled. 
The authorisation of attérir for 17 aircraft between 23 pm and 5 p. m., as envisaged in the national government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against air pollution at night. 
The coalition must have decided for the 4 January if it wants to make a cassation appeal against the judgement. 
The opposition criticises this deadline and tries to put pressure on the government representative for celui-cirenonce to appeal to the Court Administratif Federal Leipzig. 
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise before the elections and to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be condidéré as a breach of a word. 
It is a damn hard to be allowed to keep its word, "said the leader of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir referring to the slogan éléctoral FDP" We want our promises ". 
The Minister Dieter Posch refute the allegations of Schäfer-Gümbel which claims that the national government tries to authorise the night flights using "avocasserie and roublardises ". 
It takes time to conduct a legal review. 
The coalition does not take a decision on the basis of a "rapid" first impression. 
The decision is legally reliable, said Stefan Müller (FDP). 
The interpretation of the opposition of the statements by its fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely érronée. 
US banks repay the aid 
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, have taken away from their ties to the state. 
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion Euros), corresponding to aid under the rescue plan Tarp. 
Across the U.S. television CNBC said in a report that Citigroup also planning to repay the aid received. 
The banking institutions are trying to get rid of restrictions, accompanying the acceptance of, such as limiting bonuses awarded to leaders as the regulation of higher costs. 
The Bank of Americaa launched a capital increase by the sale of securities with investors who told him $19 billion of fresh money. 
The remainder comes from the coffers of the bank which are met through the sale of several branches of other sectors. 
On Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis the Director General of the Bank of America had expressly to thank American taxpayers: the injection of capital has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period. 
The banking institution had assumed capabilities by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil. 
The Citigroup is also looking to get money on the financial markets in order to get rid of the tutelage of the state. 
The American bank could launch as early as Thursday a capital increase of $20 billion, reported across the CNBC quoting the bank. 
The spokesman of Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information. 
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley Chase had repaid public funds they had received. 
Election accelerated 
Finally even more quickly than expected. 
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current holding of the post of chief redacteur Nikolaus Brender by the Council of across the German ZDF, the successor is appointed. 
The committee wanted to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment. 
Peter Frey who heads the drafting of Berlin ZDF was the odds-on favorite. 
Across the did not want to confirm - officially - the vote so as not to pre-empt the procedure. 
However, it seems that there was also the desire not to further undermine the steward of the ZDF Markus Schächter should the proposal would not be accepted by the Council of Administration. 
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, needs the votes of 9 members of the Commission on 14. 
The outcome of the vote was not yet known to the closure of the drafting of this edition. 
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Council of extension of five years of the contract of Nikolaus Brender but it had been rejected. 
Only 7 members of the Council had supported the renewal of Brender and 7 others had voted against. The impeachment by vote of Brender was a resounding failure although predictable for Schächter. 
Indeed, the CDU, which is majority in the Council of Administration had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not wishing to renew Brender to his post. 
It is Roland Koch, the Land of Hesse who had organised a league against the editor. 
He had denied that the contract of the redacteur chief, citing the fact that the rate of listening to the news of the ZDF had fallen under Brender. 
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, lashing out at the growing political influence on the ZDF. 
At the end there was even 35 experts in public law who had meddled in the debate and who argued that the action of Koch was unconstitutional. 
But it will have achieved nothing. 
Peter Frey: who is it? 
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 to Bingen. 
He studied the sciences-politiques, the pedagogy etles Romance languages (Spanish). 
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (radio body of Rhineland-Palatinate) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (national). 
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first to the news magazine "heute-journal" (newspaper today). 
Then its journey continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the Deputy rédacteur-en-chef of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (emissions fortnightly information fortnightly presented the morning); until 2001 it was responsible for the service of foreign policy of the ZDF leader of strategy-drafting Berlin. 
After the disgrace of Brender, which had just been elected journalist of the year by the journal Medium Magazin, the Greens have announced that they laid down a constitutional complaint 
The Koch opponent of the Council, the Minister of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the Treaty of warm the ZDF so that the proposals of the steward cannot be blocked by a political majority biased. 
However, Beck does not intend to call for the withdrawal of political figures who are members of monitoring the ZDF. 
Peter Frey, the likely successor to Brender had skilfully manoeuvred to the Council of Administration in criticising the Committee vehemently in its decision to Brender. 
This evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the post of rédacteur-en-chef without losing face, as well as the Council of Administration could elect without the soupconne to place as a partisan politics. 
In the representations arithmetic of parties, Frey is ranked liberal left-wing. 
Cleansing in university studies 
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs Länder decide to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between Ministers and delegates of the conference of chancellors, an agreement has been developed that the working conditions of students Bachelor or Master should be improved. 
In the future, students should be able to overcome their studies. 
They are particularly accordpour lighten the burden of reviews: a single review must close the module of study. 
Moreover, the burden of work will have to be reconsidée to ensure "a realistic and acceptable ". 
The political authorities and higher education institutions want to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad. 
The Länder are equally committed to organise common structural requirements more flexible for the networks of Bachelor and Masters. 
At the regional level, there should be no different regulation of a Land to another. 
Fewer examinations 
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Minister of Education Länder and vice-chancellors of universities have repeatedly to the mouth the catchword: "étudiabilité ". 
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a practical significance. 
The accreditation council decided to slash the number of some reviews: "Each module should normally be concluded by a single review ", in a document of thirty pages on future conditions for admission to university cycles. 
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Board of accreditation says that significantly reducing the burden of examinations should be able to stop the slippage, which damaged considerably to the étudiabilité. 
The "étudiabilité" should also be, in future, the decisive criterion of the organisation of studies. 
The modules like the substance must be examined carefully to see if you can't avoid this feeling of suffocation that we get in the choice of courses. 
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception. 
Students should "have the opportunity and space to allow and encourage the personal initiative ". 
The new regulation will access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to the existing cycles. 
These cycles must be "réaccrédités" every 5 years, which means, however, that it was only in 2015 that all cycles have been examined. 
10 relevant accreditation agencies throughout the federal which depend on board of accreditation created by the Länder. 
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes are not too busy and the regime of not too strict. 
In some Länder, universities and colleges specialized have already heard with their regional departments to take the appropriate measures. 
The Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only Land to have agreed to grant more resources for the development of the Bologna process. 
With these funds, universities must organise programmes tutorielset strengthen the offices of educational guidance offices of examinations and the service of international relations 
The Länder and universities provide for a budget of EUR 10 million. 
In early 2010, the government wishes to submit to Parliament an amendment to the law on higher education institutions. 
Despite this, it will take more than a single review to close its studies. 
The organization needs to be more flexible, more must be able to guarantee the recognition of notes recording other institutions of higher education and access to the Masters must be simplified. 
By the end of next year, "étudiabilité" of all the university will be reviewed. 
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition have again debated the question of study conditions in the country. 
The décisionsont been welcomed but there have been some criticisms. 
The Federal President of the union of students Socialists has indicated that he would like the organization of the education policy is more in the future "behind closed doors" of Ministers and chancellors universities. 
At the latest after the strike, students as people should be able to speak a little. 
The future of higher education diplomés received the support of the President of conference delegates Rectors' (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience of students is very useful," she said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of education Länder with which the HRK is working on a project of reform. 
For the union of Education and Science (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It calls for the right and the opportunity for each Bachelor graduate to enroll in a cycle of Masters. 
Andreas Keller steering committee member of the GEW request that the Länder provide students Bachelor today, tomorrow there will be enough places for studies in Masters and conditions of studies as good as possible. 
The Länder must hire more instructors. 
By contrast, the Ministers of Education have not mentioned the possibility to ease access to the Masters. 
More than a footnote on Herta Müller 
It is by these words "Comes in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." of the poet Werner Söllner, in which he 'in snippets of sentences troubling, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany which has gained freedom but has lost at the same time its territory. 
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 to Banat in Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and, subsequently, director of collection in a publishing house for youth before relocating to Frankfurt. 
Söllner received several literary prizes; in 1993 he was the Chair very popular poetry of the Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 it is director of the forum of literature in Hesse to the house of artist of Mousonturm in Frankfurt. 
He has done a lot of him in circles not literary last Tuesday, during a congress in Munich, whose theme was "the German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files ". 
Clearly destabilised and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his colleagues writers germano-roumains as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had worked as an informant for the police policy Securitate. 
Söllner received in 1989 the price of the German language together with some of the participants. 
The trials of recruitment had started insidiously in 1971. 
I am, "Söllner" therefore someone who has not sufficiently stood auxessais intimidation of the Securitate. " 
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant IM Walter (Walter). 
Almost simultaneously with the honoration Nobel for Herta Müller and its literary copies into conflict with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, in a case which clearly shows the gulfs and a political system, based on the police surveillance and espionage. 
Werner Söllner is, as mildly according to current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim. 
In his own Securitate file, IM Walter has played a role, the specialist literature Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and it refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had intervened in its favour. 
"he had the benefit of all the difficult situations at the time ", according to Markel. 
Markel has felt the need moralde make this comment. 
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in public was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident of its cooperation with the Romanian secret services is in fact, not so surprising. 
Germany is a reserve for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper Die Zeit, having read the 914 pages of his own record. 
We can assume that the victims have made speculation and sometimes have guessed what real names were using last names borrowing Sorin, Voicu and Walter. 
Unlike Germany, where the consultation of the Stasi is a reliable, the attitude to the legacy of the files of the Securitate is still very confused. 
A systematic clarification has been constantly frustrated and slowed down in recent years. 
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the institution Birthler has been created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but the transfer of files rather dragged since. 
Since 2005 there has been a law that defines the management of archives. 
The influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed in an interview with a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, spoke very dismissive of the winner. 
She had a scare, and ultimately had interviewed only once. 
The infamy of power was intending to speak here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression. 
Admittedly, inevitable questions are involved in the case Söllner as happens so often in a context of guilt hidden. 
Why now? Which has been deprived? The measured auditors, the admission of Söllner, gives us hope that the result of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge that by accusations and a sense of shame. 
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote. 
Storms in the Champions League 
We had the impression that a representative was there, spruce coming straight from a Christmas party cool, on which the sportswear manufacturer had spread its goods when the new coach VFB Christian Gross monta at quarter to midnight in a Mercedes C Class, that he had just call, a plastic bag supplier. 
The man, whose skull interpret those attracted attention, allowed himself to drive in the city that was still foreign. 
Otherwise our quinquagénaire could have taken the wheel - he had not been drinking alcohol and it was not drunk of happiness. 
He had spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow it is necessary to return to work. 
It is now that it would begin. 
The words of Switzerland that had just launched three days earlier were clear: "we have reached the final eighth of ", that is to say in the champions league thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania" but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by the success. This will be a brutal struggle not to fall back ". 
The "hard work" we expected Sunday. 
It is to repeat in Mainz the results of the champions league. 
And it will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three quick goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.) 
Nadal 
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16. / 17. + 23. / 24 February / return match 9. / 10. + 16/17. March) will be drawn on December 18. Nyon. 
The joy of the inauguration non-flame-proof of Babbel was moderate. 
And the joy was not moderate just one chance, which had sent professionals of Stuttgart destabilised, highly motivated and the pleasure of play. 
I see the players and I told them that they should focus on their assets, I advised to be more courageous, went on to the plumber "souls" - Gross - the recipe for success that sounded if bienmais which was more effects with the Babbel care-giving. 
It triggered a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - a supporter of Babbel - "in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that we would never have thought possible ". 
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of break for injury, avança as the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" found by a proverbial "fresh wind" and working method of the new leader: "It is someone who takes action and requires discipline. 
That is what we need in the current situation ". 
But apparently Babbel had failed. 
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet turned the corner, warned the manager Horst Heldt 
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs of tenacity. 
Just as Gross, the players and the manager tightlipped about overstate the victory against a defence completely outdated and weakened guests Romanian. 
They had also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening to Leverkusen with the 0:4, objecta Khedira. 
Horst Heldt, the manager, signaled that they had reached a goal of the season but there were others who were still far. 
We have not yet out of the woods. 
That Heldt on the day of its 40th anniversary has not had the heart to celebrate, even after the first victory at home over the past three months, is the events of the weekend that a television interview of goalie Jens Lehmann did bounce back just before the start of the match. 
There are decisions for others and not Jens, viability Heldt, in response to the criticism of Lehmann. 
He had accused the direction of weakness of style and said that it had decided to change of coach under pressure from fans pubertaires. 
Lehmann had also seen as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele fact that her first day of free after the matches him was removed. 
The statements of Lehmann were "marked by a pure selfishness" ground Heldt and announced consequences for the goalie. 
They are more likely to become friends for life these two lifelong non-smokers. 
In any cast, they agreed to everything else, that is to say that without the work of the group by the coach replaced, the strong representation and combative would not have been possible. 
Babbel and his assistants have been "instrumental in the success" rétorquèrent Heldt and Lehmann together - and even in plastic bag acquiesça. 
World Cup heavy 
Hot battle in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger motivates constantly verbally and gestuellement the world champion Vitali Klitschko. 
But after twelve rounds difficult Ukrainian Taras advocated the title of world champion of heavy goods vehicles from the version of the federation WBC. 
Was the unanimous judges it binding to the points. 
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko retains the title of world champion of heavy goods vehicles. 
The federation WBC announced that on the night of Saturday the champion of 38 years had won a victory to the points unaminité judges against American Kevin Johnson (120:10). 
For the third time Klitschko defends with honour its title since its comeback on stage in October 2008. 
Previously the Ukrainian had already won twice the title of world champion of WBO federations and WBC. 
Unfortunately it has not passed the long-awaited knock-out. 
Klitschko, sortit 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, has conceded twice its defeat because of injuries. 
The challenger Johnson had to accept its first defeat in the 24 th. 
In the Arène Berne, before 17.000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted above all to dictate the fight, from its 2,02 metres, by its against left. 
Johnson, of eleven centimetres smaller who, before the duel, announced the end of the era Klitschko, managed to avoid the blows of the champion, empéchant Klitschko to bring into play his right against dangeureuse. 
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has tried to make the rounds. 
Although he continued to cause Klitschko in words and gestures attacks reached very rarely the champion. 
It is the second pro after Timo Hoffman in 2000, has exceeded with Klitschko distance of twelve rounds. 
The challenger had done a lot of noise in the capital Switzerland before. 
It insulta Klitschko the "dirty" zombie "is not really capable of. 
During the weighing on Friday, the champion could not help provoke Johnson by removing his sunglasses nose "to be able to see his eyes ". 
Fourth victory since the comeback of Klitschko. 
Klitschko imposed again in his fourth struggle since its comeback on October 11, 2008 
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten at the time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered its "belt" WBC that it had previously give up without a fight. 
This year, defending his title of champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola US. 
"I have just taken a battering in this fight and am in perfect form" said Klitschko to explain its rapid return on the ring. 
His rève is to try to bring in the family the four titles. 
His brother Wladimir is champion of WBO federations and IBF. 
But it is the British David Hague who, having détroné the great Nikolai Walujew - 2,13 metres - in November, bears the belt of the WBA. 
This summer, Hague had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko in September. 
It would appear that its development company intends to play this match at Wembley in London. 
The case Kunduz 
Frontal attack opposition: the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Ministry of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the case of the case Kunduz. 
The parties SPD and the Left (the Left) require Chancellor explanations. 
Hamburg / Berlin - After review of the latest information on the air attack Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) délibérémentdissimulé some facts. 
The Minister has intentionally "an untruth" on the murderous hitting two Canadairs last September, said the leader of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the emission of information across the ARD "Tagesschau" (the newspaper 20 (h). 
Clearly, this means that he lied. 
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF). 
It is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said. 
Last Friday, according to new revelations of the media, the objective of lafrappe was in reality, not to destroy the stolen trucks, but was intended to eliminate two important Taliban leadership. 
According to the investigation of NATO, 142 people had been killed or injured in the attack American airline which was launched at the request of the German Colonel Goerg Klein, military commander Kunduz. 
The Greens, the SPD and the Left have asked Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to decide as quickly as possible before the federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident. 
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast believe that Mrs Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the strategy of targeted massacre is part of the Afghan Government fédéralet if the Chancery, the army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy. 
The spokesman of the Government categorically rejects such criticism. 
The Chancery has in no way influenced the interventions of the army in Afghanistan, he said. 
Saturday, voices were increasingly strong to express doutesquant the real reasons the removal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as had been presented by the department. 
According to the information of the newspaper SPIEGEL, the information that they had handed over to Guttenberg concerning the attack tankers were both correct and complete. 
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the report of NATO and hid the Minister some details troublesome. 
In the midst of two senior officials is that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a document of two pages of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police. 
The Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung "reports that Wichert would have asked in a letter a clarification of the facts. 
So far, it has not been answered 
Saturday, the department did not want to comment on the allegations and referred to the Committee of Inquiry of the federal Parliament that was approaching the next Wednesday to dapporter light on the facts. 
The worlds of the dream 
Some see, awake, images and hear voices that nobody else sees or hears. 
It is not that of psychiatric patients, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between fantasy and reality overlap. 
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is going very well. 
When we are lying down in our bedrooms clouded, we can do without hindrance to the wildest dreams and fantasies. 
However, awake, experienced dream, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, has a reputation in our Western world to be crazy or drugged, or at least to be an original. 
Such images and voices are not that sick mental or under the influence of drugs. 
That is our imagination that is at stake: this is the same activity neuronale which allows us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, but sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality to melt. 
Wakefulness aware, in the form of a dream, may be in the various forms, in the best you call it visions, at worst madness. 
But even if the trigger and the effect differ, the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the experiences of drugs in the prophet of New Age Carlos Castaneda, the latter of chamanes, psychoses and hallucinations are due to process very similar. 
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, substances neurotransmettrices brain - first and foremost the dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and the achétylcholine - breaks down and that the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted. 
The hallucinations complex and wild thoughts occur very often during a psychosis schizophrenic. 
The force of attraction land has more power on the person. 
Since the ancient world, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between the madness and the dream. 
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of rêve-éveillé; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 'a great similarity between the madness and the dream, "for Sigmund Freud the dream was" a psychosis with all irregularities, imagination, delusions and illusions sensory its. ". 
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into character of a comic strip. 
His body is in two dimensions to criardes colours. 
The attraction land has more power on him, there is the explosion of the ceiling. 
It is a blow. 
Behind him creatures of devil ailées, grimaçantes, the mouth blood-ridden, showing the teeth. 
They are, give it blows of feet with heavy boots bold, the cast against the walls, it feels pain throughout the body. 
The thundering voice, evil, shouting, outside walls and radio. 
It can no longer bear these voices who insult and humiliate. 
Henning t. peck two cables of its chain stereos, in fact a loop and attaches to a hook ceiling. 
It is on a baffle and happens the circle around the neck. 
It is plain. 
The loop. 
You serve as a lesson, the loudest voice in a chorus to extract the tympan. "in a clinic and fais-toi! ' 
Today Henning t. 40 years ago, he lived six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first of nearly 20 years. 
It was triggered by LSD. 
The diagnosis: psychosis schizo-affective, paranoid, in addition, it is maniaco-dépressif, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia. 
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years. 
During the psychosis I have undergone terrible fears and despondency. 
The illusions are a cruel reality. 
About an one percent of the population suffers at least once in a lifetime of schizophrenia; in the psychiatric hospital that is the most common illness after depression. 
In a crisis of schizophrenia, people can no longer make the difference between the inside and the outside world, they find themselves in a wildly excitement, where they can suffer from hallucinations, of megalomania, of madness relational or persecution. 
It is very easy to hear voices - who commission, which elicited comments or dialogue. 
The optical hallucinations are not rare. 
The person can no longer distinguish between the important and insignificant, the brain can no longer filter signals disruptive, the aware is drowned in the sensations. 
Just as the dream, the hype opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies of deeper layers of the conscience. 
The perception of reality in the hype is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry CHU of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum). 
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the situation, meaning focused on him. 
At the same time it is reflected in a passive role, it is like a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively. 
That is why the schizophrenic often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated. 
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality, the illusions are a cruel reality, wake up. 
Experience once in her life a hallucination. 
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory structure and space to the reality that is seen during the psychosis, is basically maintained ". 
The thoughts and hallucinations wild are based on reality, the alienation of lived in a real framework. 
Why our brains it this kind of ’, is still a mystery to researchers. 
Exceptional situations can get everyone to temporarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs. 
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis. 
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that the genes are not the only determinants. 
Researchers assume that the persons concerned are petty brain damage. 
It is assumed that the neuronale maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development for example, by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, "Fuchs. 
But what remains unexplained is how the anomaly of the system neuronal occurs and also the fact that it is not for many years. 
Environmental factors also play a role - the stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, if there is predisposition. 
Similarly hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they affect the neurotransmitters. 
When our brains heating in. 
This is crazy, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck is that the psychotic suffer from their hallucinations and catastrophic drug to forgo while others buy drugs very expensive for atomic weapons. 
The perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a question of point of view. 
Kasten together for ten years of reports on the hallucinations and images illusory: last year he published his results in a book entitled "the world unrealistic in our heads ". 
The hallucinations are typical of many apparent psychoses but also a huge number of many other pathologies. 
These include the psychiatric problems as the borderline or depression but also the headache, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or the cranial trauma. 
It is surprising that in certain conditions even the brains of healthy people is subject to hallucinations. 
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consists of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited. 
They are taking shape when the areas of the brain that deal sensory perceptions, are hyperactives or not sufficiently refrénées; when our brains heating in but also when there is lack of stimulation. 
The drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or psychosis. 
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, much misery of love or other mental states exceptional. 
In recent studies, a third of participants recognises have made at least once in her life experience a hallucination. 
In summer 2005 Sarah k. 16 years ago, she lives a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and it goes to the school. 
A young girl to normal. 
If it was not the images and voices. 
During the recess, a young boy, slim, with long hair, châtain him the floor. 
When she meets his comrades watch, surprised - nobody else sees or hears this boy. 
They believe that this girl timid is a lunatic puts but Sarah K does not dream, it is certain. 
It is being stirred, hears and sees this boy as she sees and hears the daughter who is sitting next to her on the bench. 
It can even see its presence temporarily. 
It is a pleasant sensation, she found that young sympathetic. 
Am I mad?, wondered sometimes. 
But she knows that this young and other visions are not and they will disappear again. 
The night the appearances are, in general, frightening. 
Often the visions are cumbersome. 
When she is in class, it can take the course because the professor is right in presenting a new pupil in his eyes and ears when it is invisible to others and that the professor is clearly explain the equations in Table. 
The night the appearances are, in general, frightening. 
When, in the darkness of his room, it expects the sleep too rarely and far too late, it can often not distinguish if it is being stirred or dream already, if the images that it sees, faces grimaçants or the girl with entailles sanguinolentes on the arms and legs before his eyes open or closed. 
Let me quiet, Cree it to these creatures. 
It is to parents or friends, they would for a mad. 
Fall 2009. Sarah k. has today 20 years. 
She had her A-levels last year and she lives with his friend. 
A year ago the hallucinations ceased. 
Since it came into contact with the psychologist Kasten it knows very well that it is not mad. 
The madness is also a work of art of despair. 
When someone is socially isolated or has not sufficient incentives, the likelihood is that he has some hallucinations after a certain time. 
I assume that the brain is not addressed, is that of animation. 
Sarah k., single girl, was afraid of other children when she was small and often played alone. 
Its hallucinations began when she learned at age 13, that the man she called Daddy, since it was in age to think, was not the true father. 
These are the same brain regions that are active in the visual hallucinations and acoustic, and the impressions and noise, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to differentiate between the illusion and reality. "every experience ", according to Kasten" takes place in the brain, the reality is formed from there. 
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, that is why they seem so real. " 
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination. 
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those in psychoses. 
Unlike schizophrenic, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that the fantasies are not real images. 
That is why Kasten advises patients to cherish the hallucinations as a particular talent. 
There is only a step between the dream and the hallucination. 
In our world too focused on the conscience has unfortunately quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for diseases, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and doctor leader of the clinic psychiatry and psychotherapy hospital Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf. 
A psychosis is a serious illness, painful but which also contains something positive, creator - the madness is a work of art of despair. 
Schmidt-degenhard has studied the form of so-called oniroïde experience, a particular form of the modification of the conscience stirred by the dream. 
The experienced oniroïdes are very complex semi-rêves which are seen as real by those who live and that it cannot differentiate the dream even when it is in wakefulness. 
The state of consciousness oniroïde occurs during a trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathie which fully aware, the experience of a paralysis. 
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of itself and the world, due to a total inability and sustainable to move, it replaces the real situation which affects his life, by his own imaginary world which is divorced from reality. 
It is a state of mental limits between the dream and the hallucination. 
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world but the real situation is represented in the imagination. 
It is in fact a form of means and interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, an organization that we have, we men, not to sink into the abyss of the loss of consciousness. 
Everything is real even later in the memories. 
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, art historian also describes his experiences oniroïdes in his book "Change of Heart" as action to safeguard the soul. 
49 years ago, when its aware left for a trip to several days after the operation of a heart valves followed by a transplant; meanwhile, his body was sentenced to stand still in resuscitation. 
Claussen plunges in a world that it has created from scratch, visit places foreign travel in time. It is old man bed in a sanatorium rail, a robot to ensure his mind on his health. 
He lives in the Middle Ages among noble manufacturing drugs derived from blood. 
It is kidnapped by a Greek to motorbike who takes in her country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the névé Alps and meeting a Korean mafia. 
It absorbs completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories. 
According to Claussen these internal travel differ fundamentally from any dream. 
The dream is totally different, "he wrote in describing what he lived. 
Instead of dreams, memories from mental journeys are extremely clear and very detailed even years later. 
They are much more distinct and more intensive than the real lived. 
The intensity of this lived provoked the horizon of our other everyday experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard. 
Ultimately, oniroïdes, psychoses, hallucinations and experiences psychédéliques show us how our representations Home of the external reality are fragile even trial-ready. 
Any change to the state of consciousness, the psychologist Kasten "can lead to a distortion of what we call the reality." 
An experience which can also be very rewarding. 
The first snows can fall 
Burda 
27 years ago, children will be the result of the publishing house. 
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of editions Burda is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda hopes that his two children return to the group of press, "he told the newspaper Spiegel. 
The holding company must remain at 100% a family business. 
Hamburg - A long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees its society in the hands of its children 
The two children inherit at 27 years and are committed to integrate society, said Hubert Burda, 69 years, Spiegel. 
All the details have been resolved in advance. 
The question of whether they will be active in the company will subsequently. 
It will also see if they are capable of. 
We cannot impose its children to 7500 staff without knowing whether they have the capacity to deal with it. 
This démolirait children as well as the company. 
Burda said last Thursday that he is pulling out of the position Président-Directeur-Général in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen. 
Kallen, 52 years, is a member of the Council of Administration since 1999. 
It was primarily responsible for the technology sector. 
It subsequently busiest sector Treasury that is to say that he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he was the head of marketing, the sector's foreign, of printing and Finance. 
And for the first time this is not a member of the family who is leading the Burda editions. 
The children of Burda have respectively 19 and 17 years, his son Felix who now 42 years old, died a few years ago. 
The nommination of Kallen also serves to make the connection of 10 or 15 years " 
Burda specifies that the holding company must remain at 100% in the hands of the family. 
The ruins have always taken place in the families who have indulged by causing a bulimia of capital, which have made enormous speculation unfortunate in thinking that they could climb ever higher. 
This has never been my strategy. 
I have never had rêvede universal power, said Burda. 
I do not see in the role of preceptor as could be Springer and I do not intend to be part of these leagues international as the Time, these companies have taken far too much importance. 
The promise of FonPeek 
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device which allows only to watch his e-mail, without providing the possibility to see some type of coins attached or surf the Internet. 
It took advantage of its five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine the appointed as one of the products of the year. 
In truth, it is more difficult to see in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people. 
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a price and a monthly subscription very low - less than half of what it costs, for example, the subscription data of the iPhone. 
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service data for life, for six times more expensive than the Peek. 
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the event the Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation. 
It is also limited his grand-frère American, but there is a surprise. 
The price of its monthly subscription, approximately EUR 12, includes the roaming throughout Europe. 
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what the abandonment to data when you cross a border or seek desperately a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a connection of Fon) to be able to check his mail. 
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and long time it should operate. 
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need for a theory in physics to understand and good glasses to read the small print. 
The repeated reminders to the European Commission to propose the price of roaming affordable throughout Europe have barely perceptible. 
Outside his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and it was not wrong. 
A small like the FonPeek (it is always curious that it calls Fon when it does not have the Wifi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are starting to think differently and studying various proposals to make their data network. 
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading of books and other research on the Internet. 
Without subscription and without soup. 
It is a device connected and pay at its purchase and not every month. 
And that is what I hope one day to the FonPeek: an option to purchase with access to life as Peek already in the United States. 
I do not want to buy. 
I look am mail on my phone, thank you. 
I wish the simply because I believe that this is a more fair formula for the consumer. 
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system. 
The colour preferred Michelle 
The yellow is, without doubt, the colour of the first lady of the United States. 
If it went to the inauguration of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat of this colour, it has chosen the same for the hand in the second time, without doubt, the most important of his life: the Oslo Nobel Peace Prize. 
Michelle Obama was a model very similar in these two occasions: in addition to their colour ressemblante, a yellow subtracting the green with reflections brilliant, twice, consisted of three parts: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same tissues, and was festooned with a great embroidery or a necklace. 
So that's a first glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States to follow the footsteps of Princess of Asturias and chose to put the same. 
But the fabric in which are carved up the two are very different. 
If for it was a delicate thick, however, it was in Oslo a printed velvet. 
Accessories also are different: green shoes to Achilles' average for the first opportunity, and a similar model, but golden, this time. 
Hairdressing also has changed: hair are now raised when it was released last time. 
75% of working mothers have had problems because of their maternity 
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women in the younger generations who want to be mothers. 
That is what the study shows ": Fertility and professional career women in Spain ", carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto of the Mujer. 
The survey, carried out on 9 737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers saw their professional career limited because of motherhood. 
The study indicates that there are many differences concerning the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, if the woman is working or not and what kind of job. 
Those who have no activity outside the home, part-time work or have a stable shortly, earlier in couple, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children. 
In contrast, women with a stable job, mainly in the public sector, postpone the entry in the relationship and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children. 
Women between 35 and 49 years with a fixed work have their first child, on average, 3,7 years after being introduced as a couple. This figure rises to 4,1 among those who work in the public sector. "these figures show that women with a stable employment needed more time in their lives for it, which led to the union and the arrival of children. 
Moreover, the type of employment exercised influence largely motherhood, but less the start date of life together, "said the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado. 
The level of education is another factor that widening the gap of the age of marriage of women and their first child. 
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child. 
The difference is also maintains among women of the same generation. 
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years, those who attended elementary and higher have been mothers for the first time at 25,1 and 32,1 years on average. 
"another disctinction also appears between women, according to their level of studies. 
While those who took elementary school marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those with studies of average level or higher reverse this programme and give priority to achieve a stable work as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child, "said Mrs Delgado. 
Diane Kruger also applies of 
L'Oreal Paris is to add a new name to its list jalousée ambassadors: Diane Kruger. 
From next year, the German actress embody the image of several products of the brand, uttering the motto "Because I the roses ". 
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses of the international scene, and join other celebrities included among the L'Oreal Paris, as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andy the dugout, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz. 
Before it, the last to enter the club if tortoises were actresses Evangeline Lilly (dismissing popular) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire). 
Among men, the brand of cosmetics also ambassadors of luxury: Patrick Dempsey (dr. Grey, lessons of anatomy) and Matthew Fox (the companion of Evangeline in dismissing popular). 
The price of British fashion 
The British have much to say in the world of fashion. 
Its greatest representatives, creators and models, yesterday and today, gathered for the annual price, which took place in London at the Royal Court of Justice. 
Nobody has missed the appointment. 
The former fashion model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia, May Jagger elected Best dummy of the year. 
The poker of Manuel Vincent 
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer of ases (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) a "x-rays" writers who have crossed his literary life (and sometimes, his other life). 
It does gender not predictable and apprehended (summary biographical, lives and works), but by seeking something similar to the core of ignition the character created. 
The trip is exciting and Vincent nor the scares nor the illuminations. 
Delicious pleasure, this book is also an invitation to moving readings and relectures. 
I leave you here a few snapshots. 
On Albert Camus: "In its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, one that I felt without the name: the pleasure against the sad fate, the moral without guilt and innocence without any god." 
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihiliste, Christian allegorical, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a humorous poetic bright, meaningless, as the blade of the knife which threatened to kill him." 
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman's a passion which lasted thirteen years, in the flesh of which he conjugua emotion of adultery at the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege to reach the sky by the road to perdition." 
On James Joyce: ‘ Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the summits of eight thousand metres of literature universal, it must climb by the north, on which the best mountaineers dropping again and again. " 
On William Faulkner: ‘ It was a strange type. 
In itself, he said that he was the son of a landowner County and other times he was the son of a black and a crocodile. 
These two dreams of grandeur. " 
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer recueillit Cree lunatic pushed from a bridge by This man of Munch to turn its attention to the substance of the night of the twentieth century, in its literary form, and it did in the brain itself and invoking remembered with a speech to the maggots." 
On Dorothy Parker: "One day it began to its knees and prayed:" Dear God, I urge you to do that I write as a woman. "

On Pío Baroja: 'What did Martín-Santos if it is to try to conceal Joyce in Baroja? 
That tried Benet if it is to shoot Baroja by Faulkner? 
That did it if it is to seek the glory of this man for him to serve as a pedestal? " 
A cowardly aggression 
Last week, my mother, who has about 70 years ago, strolling in our neighbourhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent next to it and our dog, a sang-mélé, saved the APS and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they assenèrent two feet which gave the dog seriously injured. 
Our indignation is huge because we do not see what it is amusing to attack charge a small animal defenceless which, moreover, was on a leash. 
Add to that the indignation of a lady who strolling calmly and which, when it injuria these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since a énergumène who attack an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old or, ultimately, anyone lower than him. 
The episode occurred around 17 pm Tuesday as another, in an area usually quiet. 
The dog has gémi all day. 
Of course, we have tabled because even if we doubt that works and not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish. 
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact. 
We do not understand what is happening in young people to find amusing to mistreat free a defenceless animal which gives us the love, friendship and our company. 
We do not know where is the good education and respect for animals and people. 
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for wearing helmets 
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spaniard Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet, mainly among motorcyclists younger, as the two structures. 
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of the port of safety-helmets, since it is the only element of protection to avoid injuries to the head, or even death, in the event of an accident in two wheels. 
Michelin said that this campaign was drafted in line with his commitment to road safety, "which goes beyond the design and manufacture of products always safer" and said that it contributed to this objective by other actions to educational and informative. 
This new campaign of encouragement of helmet-wearing in two wheels, under the motto "to be or not to be ", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages of motorcycles, in order to guarantee the wider dissemination. 
Finally, Michelin has stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop products always safer. 
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing 
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel. 
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12,6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the employers' federation of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, the number of dealers. 
However alter the good news, since the reference to the comparison, the month of November 2008, has been particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year. 
Consequently, despite the rebound last month, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year. 
Since January, if you add up all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (derivatives of cars, a, vans, light-duty vehicles and lorries to chassis) 95 853 have been sold. 
The clouds that affect the more their did not dispelled. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized businesses, which pay in almost 100% of cases through an external funding. 
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved by limiting the bank credits, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the downturn. 
Faced with this situation and the difference for passenger cars, aid for the purchase of 2000 E have little used. 
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3,5 tonnes with a level of emissions sharply which does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself. 
Yesterday, in Ganvam, recalled the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and industrial vehicles (lorries and buses). 
The dealers ’ association provides 2010 similar to that ending, for which she calculates a drop in sales (for passenger cars and 4 x4s) of 19%. 
Aid to the emergency braking is now mandatory 
As has occurred with the system of ABS anti-lock brakes and as will take place with the ESP stability control systems, aid for emergency will be a compulsory element on European cars. 
They are already compulsory on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly-registered, while the rest of the vehicles for a period of deprivation has been set up at the end of February 2011. 
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by its action, it can also help prevent many rear shocks. 
The assistant emergency braking is increasing the pressure on the brakes in urgent cases detected by the system through the kick given by the driver. 
But it does not always maintain the pressure until the end. 
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident had not been able to slam on the brakes before the collision, and half of them had not taken advantage of strength. 
Up to 1 100 accidents 
The intervention of the aid, in revancha, requires the brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop. 
According to a study of the EU, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year. 
This reduction would be even more important with the popularisation of so-called intelligent systems braking emergency: is calculated that a sinister on four with injured would be avoided. 
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to act slightly on the brakes. 
If the driver reacts, it aid by increasing the pressure on the brake, if necessary. 
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device is the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize the damage. 
General Motors postponed until January the plan for Opel 
While the workers at the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva model would be launched during the first week of April - probably the 8 -, according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the plan to rescue Opel. 
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is that every step of the plan has been approved by the party concerned. 
And this may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to workers and the governments of the countries where the factories, be postponed until early 2010. 
By contrast, GM, ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the next few days. 
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has stepped up the pressure on the American manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible. 
GM admits be in contact with possible new buyers. 
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converg, is increasing in importance. 
In the case where there would agree with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic. 
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained. 
Traffic-safety-related the Porsche Boxster Spyder 
To design their last and valuable jewellery, engineers of Porsche are parties to the Boxster S and managed to the amincir nothing that less than 80 kg, which leaves the balance to only 1 275 kilograms. 
This has led to happen, first, the roof automatic which has been replaced by a roof bâché manual, capable of delivering 21 kilos, to employ doors aluminium as those of the GT3, other 15 kilos of less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the reservoir of petrol from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of earned, to mount bacquets sport, still 12 kilos, and with tyres light of 19 inches, five kilos. 
Finally, they have relinquished the audio system CDR- 30, earning six other kilograms and replaced the poignéesdes doors by handfuls in tissues, saving the remaining kilo. 
Although the model also exists with the PDK dual clutch, the test was carried out on a model to manual box of six speeds, mainly on secondary roads network of California, mountain, with a shift particularly tortuous. 
His behaviour can only be described as of irreproachability. 
The weight does not prevent the car to drive on the ground with aplomb. 
On the contrary: it has been a long time that we had not tested a model also small and light which, at the same time, ensures security in cornering, including high-speed. 
It is a small athlete, capable of stirring up its musclesà small speed during the time necessary, until we needed him to great sprinter, to curb, to recover and to push for new its engine … 
It is out what we wanted. Through its direction, also communicative that, the car will do what will our hands on the steering wheel. 
And it will do so with surgical precision. 
Its engine at will 
The sound of his V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the "sport" or through a system that changes the rugissement engine, already used on the Panamera. 
The acceleration is brutal, either to the judgment or success. 
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable. 
The roads that we have travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite weakened, but the car was well managed the nests of chicken. 
The electronic assistants were barely act of presence throughout the journey, while on some shifts we have found ice early morning and graviers, later in the morning. 
Ultimately, a car ultralégère, more fun to drive and which is more than a simple amendment of the Boxster s. 
The car will be for sale in February 2010, at a price of 70 831 euros. 
"bag Girl" 
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the line Coco Cocoon and starlette occasional parades of the house, the singer posted his face of bad girl with as much room as its bags is. 
More than a "Bad Girl" or "it Girl ", it is a" Bag Girl ". 
The Baskonia offers a victory in Israel 
The Caja Laboral scored a resounding triumph in 91 - 82 during his visit on the ground of the Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences of the team of Dusko Oliver Ivanovic. It is at the top of his group, after the great spectacle of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight baskets at three points was the best of its evaluation team (29). 
The team of Vitoria was able to fill the absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large degree of commitment and collective work, even if it had to wait until the end to win the fight. 
Moreover, the great skill since the perimeter, with 16 baskets at three points scored, determined the final victory. 
The match started quickly for the blue and red, who took the advantage from the start. 
The fact that the first four baskets of the team of Vitoria labelled since the perimeter, was that they had jumped on the ground with his wrists hot. 
English and Teletovic have been the main architects of the 18 - 20 final of the first put on quarter-time. 
The second put on quarter-time was on the same tone, but the team's Aleves chose the game within Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by cheers and applause to return to her old house, to increase their advantage at the break (34 - 43). 
Teletovic already starting to be noticed as the best player of his team, with 13 points scored, although the "least six" assessment of Splitter was already likely that this night would not be the best of the Brazilian. 
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on track to the break, nothing was played, far from it, and the team's Avala wanted to remind Vitoria that is not so easily on their ground, and thanks to "the hand of Elias ’, they succeeded to go the match. 
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to what the yellow take the advantage on the light (50 - 49). 
Other difficulties 
The players from Oliver Ivanovic, injured but far from dead, needed shackling nimble few actions clever for air, and then that's submachine gun of Mirza Teletovic who, with three baskets to three consecutive points and aid English and Ribas delayed the meter to score a reassuring (54 - 67), and that the local did so in the end of the third on (57 - 67). 
The team's Avala sortit to play for at the last period and English and San Emeterio (60 - 75) avisèrent that they were tired person their take what they had earned during the first thirty minutes. 
Nevertheless, Pnini Eidson, the best of their team, does not résignèrent and tried to support it in line with the three points (70 - 77). 
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, Oliver Ivanovic players do not rush, advocated well, and although the Israeli has come closer at the last minute (80 - 85), the game was already played and the victory to Tel Aviv for the first time in the season. 
The injuries prevent Unicaja to do battle 
The Unicaja lost loudly in Greece ’ Olympiacos and has given him the head of the Group B of the Euroligue, in a match marked by the absence of players of the Unicaja, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which have facilitated the Greek victory. 
The team of Malaga was not frightened by the atmosphere of the flag of Peace and Friends, nor by the scale of the rival, without doubt one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget. 
The game of the first put on quarter-time, allowed to dream the Andalusian. An aggressive defence and three baskets to three consecutive points, two of the ringleader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio has ébloui team local 12 - 18, in the ninth minute. 
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the game within Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, has helped to overthrow the score 22 - 20, in the thirteenth minute, when action, a beginning of fight, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams led the disqualification of two players. 
The Greek team started operating in showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit wound of the pivotal English Joel Freeland and three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez hung over the Unicaja. 
The players and the Lithuanian supremely Linas Kleizas, with their baskets at three points, dug the advantage, 44 - 32, in the nineteenth minute. 
A rebound impossible 
The third period was particularly offensive to the Olympiacos which, despite the 19 loss, was higher and even came to match the difference of the meeting to be contested in Malaga 66 - 48, at the twenty-seventh minute, rocked the head of the group. 
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last out of the central Scotland's Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting. 
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organisation, baskets at three points of Cook, and support for Lewis, left a little hope with 66 - 57 st minute. 
But the victory was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos was relentless when the players were pressure and showed their superiority in centimetres in the area. 
The Croatian Nikola Vujcic, managed to climb the score to 81 - 62th minute, and the Unicaja be censored, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.

Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya 
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya into its embassy in Tegucigalpa. 
The deposed president will have to abandon the diplomatic legation no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the formal end of its mandate. 
Francisco Catunda, chargé d ’ affaires of the embassy of Brazil in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to Globo TV that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where it is refugee since 21 September, before that date. 
"it is aware that he must leave on 27 January, at the end of its mandate, it must seek another destination ". 
The chain has also cited the former agent, who has confirmed its intention that leave the embassy before the end of the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone. 
After the elections of 29 November (during which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya has given assurances that he would remain in the embassy of Brazil until January. 
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil. 
The operation has ultimately failed, since Zelaya refused the condition of exiled political intended to impose the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti. 
Thank you very much 
After days roses since last spring, during which the asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty there arises again, which is not surprising since it comes to their natural state, in an environment where officers take decisions on a future inherently uncertain. 
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise markets has been to monetize the debt by direct purchase of assets and indirectly by abundant liquidity to rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilise. 
Central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have been virtually finalised and, without questioning their political maverick of liquidity, are beginning to put a bit of sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with their tender to one year to the next week. 
Therefore, investors have doubts about the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic recovery without measures heterodox and we are seeing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums. 
The volatility of stock markets and the obligations of companies are growing again, although they remain very remote levels paranormaux levels they have achieved at the beginning of the year. 
The Member obliged to socialize the risk private and public debt is again affected. 
There is again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the shelters chosen by investors, provocative greater differences between the countries of the euro zone and Germany. 
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a new downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain. 
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of the moral hazard, who were trying to provoke a matter of conscience among lesresponsables of global economic policy that had slowed down the destructive effects of the credit on the destruction of employment, when what we should do is announcing a new day of action. 
However, the situation of Dubai resembles a fight between the tribal sheikhs in restoring its place in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece. 
A government which conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that uncovered the pot in roses. 
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso. 
It would be perfectly irrational that Ecofin saves Hungary a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country of the euro area not to meet its commitments. 
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has prompted the Greek government to transparency and makes its citizens share the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances. 
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of standardisation of risk premiums transitional, after some excesses in high positions, this would be predictable. 
In the Spanish case, as our differences of public debt increase commensurate with the obligations of European companies, nousn not to worry. 
If the European shriveled and that ours continued to increase, it would be a risk idiosyncrasique Spanish. 
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our indicators forecast forced most of the services of studies to anticipate their models of recovery and to revise up their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, returning to the burden with a Japanese model pourl Spanish economy, it ’ not much hope for their warning. 
Again, this has to be an excellent opportunity to buy assets Spanish, even if for now "prudence is the mother of security ". 
Sectors connected 
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where is discussed these days the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades. 
After his speech, which was followed by the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán sketched out to the press what he had said before the subcommittee, to shortlist. 
For President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 000 million until 2020 and 60 000 million more between then and 2030, in the case where nuclear power stations today in operation would remain open. 
If that is not the case, the necessary investments is not amount to 60 000 million but 95 000. 
By contrast, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investment should not be devoted to the increase of production capacity, but the distribution networks and interconnections. 
From 2020, the issue is changing, and it will increase the power. 
His gamble focuses on the central gas to coal, with mechanisms for recovery of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy. 
In this field, it believes that 18 000 MW of more are needed, with other "support renewable ". 
Galán that Bill's sustainable economy that the government has to approve is in line with what calls for his company, did not want to attack the Royal Decree to encourage consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policies to combat global warming. 
According to him, there is "a gamble clear long-term" in this sense, the "one-off ", as the President has qualified for Iberdrola. 
In any event, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are in the long term, must be taken, because they are some time before they reach their maturity and a lucrative stable framework is needed to address them.

Acciona is fighting for his first motorway in concession in Australia, market on which it is already working as a business manager of energy and water. 
The shipyard at stake is a tunnel estimated at 1 700 million Australian dollars (around EUR 1 047 million). 
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rival. 
A tunnel 5 kilometres long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, such is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a company of public works and dealer of motorways.

Having chosen the public / private partnership (PPP for its initial) to complete the project, in the framework of a plan under the tutelage of Erns & Young, local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll. 
Waiting for the submission of bids next May, investment planned amounts to 1 700 million Australian dollars (around EUR 1 047 million) and in the last phase three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers. 
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, only Spanish company in smooth, and his associates are BMD and Ghella. 
The first is one of the largest manufacturers Australian, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists to work underground. 
Against the team's Acciona, rub the consortium Northern Direct, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, manager of the Australian infrastructure Transfield and the French manufactureer group Bouygues.

The Australian market infrastructure promises great shipyards and privatisation, but enter represents a great difficulty, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company. 
A strategy that followed the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which is still a step not validated for the Spanish giants of the sector. 
ACS has barely winning a place on the market by its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton. 
Active millionaires 
Acciona a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its activity of energy supplier and desalination. 
Among other assets, it has the largest fleet of wind turbines, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and directs the reunification of companies to build and manage the dessalinisateur's - with a budget of 700 million. 
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to take advantage of synergies to enter the markets of the construction and management of infrastructure. 
The road toll underground, promoted by the Bureau of the infrastructure of the city of Brisbane and the Northern link liaison (north), is called upon to link the motorway west of Toowong peripheral to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. It is the largest project existing to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane. 
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the auction will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will start in December of next year. 
Despite the fact that this road toll will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not anticipated that the project is completed before 2016. 
The tunnel has begun to be designed in 2005. 
It will include two carriageway, a system of electronic toll and a complex ventilation system. 
The Queensland Government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its funding. 
Brisbane already provides work to Hochtief 
Australia continues to make a great Hochtief, who mentioned yesterday obtaining a contract with the government estimated at 154 million. 
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national network fibre-optic broadband. 
This will enable 400 000 people to have quick access to the Internet and provide jobs to the German company for 18 months. 
On the other hand, the company has ceded the construction of the tower King George, 27 -storey, in the city of Brisbane. The work have not yet started and Hochtief concluded the sale for 129 million. 
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.

A fine of 63 million to France Télécom to curb competition 
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of EUR 63 million to France Télécom for its anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean region in the country. 
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, through tariffs and loyalty programs to consumers on the fringes of the regulation. 
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still company state, is more than EUR 450 million in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts its competitors. 
The sanctioning yesterday has been increased because the authority which ensures competition considers that France Télécom has committed offences in the past and it is therefore punches.

Their participation in the Champions League received $476,4 million to Real Madrid and Barcelona since its creation 
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs, since its birth in 1992. 
Indeed, Real Madrid and Barcelona f. c. earned 467,4 million, which puts them in third and fifth position of clubs who have pocketed the more money in this competition. 
The Manchester United is at the top of the list. 
The Manchester United is at the top of the list. 
Win the UEFA Champions League does not only the glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of big clubs. 
Indeed, competition has allocated EUR 5 362,5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992 - 1993 season, according to information from UEFA. 
The Real Madrid and Barcelona f. c. have been well served in this division. 
The club Paper was the third of the continent to reach the more money for his participation, and the only one, with the Keynes Milan, has won three times the trophy. 
The Catalan club, current taking the title and last winner of the old European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list. 
At the top of the list are the Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams which, moreover, have charged the more money for their participation in the Champions League. 
And that, although they have lost in the Barcelona. 
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, as regards the money reported by the Champions League, although it won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two). 
Distribution 
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure of distribution of the money applied by UEFA. 
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini expects to earn 1 090 million thanks to the Champions League. 
Of this amount, UEFA will devote 413,1 million fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the classification matches (including the Atlético Madrid) received 2,1 million. 
In addition, those who have managed to fit received 3,8 million just to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each match disputed. 
There is also a bonus in the event of victory (800 000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those who arrive in huitièmes of final receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in a quarter-final reçoivent3, 3 million. 
The last four teams will each receive 4 million. 
And the champion will win $9 million, compared to the 5,2 received by the other finalists. 
Thus, fixed payments, a club gain at least 7,1 million, and a maximum of 31,2 million. 
On the other hand, the Barça has pocketed $2,5 million for winning the Super Cup Europe in August. 
But in addition, there are the payments variables, which are 337,8 million. 
This money is distributed on the basis of proportional value of each market. 
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four seats attitrées. 
The champion of the previous year to 40% of the money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth. 
The other party will be paid by the number of matches played during the edition of the year. 
Nueva Rumasa provides EUR 61 million for 29,9% of Sos. 
The group Nueva Rumasa has listed yesterday the details of the offer to purchase of actions by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29,9% of the capital of Sos.

In the meantime, Sos continues a restructuring of its direction. 
In an attempt to remain outside any offers to purchase and jumping judicial of its former directors, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as director of internal audit. 
A decision that in fact the first woman to occupy a leading position in the food company. 
It is a newly created position will depend directly from the president of the group. 
And it is not without controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged misuse of more than 230 million Sos to companies of Salazar. 
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos reveals new misappropriation of funds cannot be ruled out. 
On the credit to Salazar, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the High Court that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination. 
The NCVM authorises the takeover of exclusion of Paternina presented by Inversora Sea

New tools for the expertise of cars 
In these days of bad weather and accidents, the car garages are not the only winners. 
Every day, thousands of cars which have undergone a sinister are back up to a garage, where an expert to assess the damage and the cost of repair. 
Every disaster is different, and the cost of coins and time of labour can be a long and complex. 
To calculate the cost of compensation of between 20 000 and 30 000 euros, including the coins and the workforce can take two or three hours. 
However, with the assistance of computer tools the most recent, it would be a matter of minutes. 
It is for this reason that almost 100% of experts use this type of systems. 
Providers of services and solutions for the assessment of claims and maintenance are in collecting information provided by manufacturers, and then treat them and offer their customers in the form of an useful tool. 
In Spain, Audatex, the North American group Solera, is the company leader; 80% of estimates are carried out with its products. 
Other companies competing in the field of tools for evaluating and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax. 
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple. 
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them their provides information in a different format. 
In addition, the amount of data to treat is growing, so that in the past five years, more versions, variants and motors have been launched that over the past fifteen years. 
When a new car fate on the market, these companies are at work. 
It is a very difficult, because each thousand pieces of the vehicle and put its price. 
In addition, a graphic image "intelligent" of each model on which you can click on the different parts of a car. 
If it is a model sold en masse, the work can be ready in a week if the process moving very quickly. 
If it is a little car sold, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99,2% of the cars sold in Spain. 
Among the most exclusive models, they have for example, of information on the Porsche, but not the Ferrari or Lamborghini. 
Concerning the vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.

The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid). 
There, more than one hundred technicians (usually experts in mechanical) work simultaneously on three screens of computers. 
Audatex invests 90 million every year to develop these databases. 
Each month, 2,5 million of data are stored, and clients receive updates every two days. 
The development of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them various uses and products. 
The most frequent application concerns the repair and maintenance, but in different countries, there are also tools for the management of the coins or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car. 
The only company that has a guide of the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax. 
Audatex does not propose in our country, but it does in the United States. 
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support that it can make in the sector. 
This company offers different tools, the flagship AudaPlus, the solution standard assessment of claims, for experts. 
There are cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles. 
In addition to the cost of coins, it takes into account the time repairs estimated by the manufacturer or the scales of paint. 
This tool is buying in terms of its use, for each estimate. 
The higher costs of 5,75 euros, for customers who use little, up to ten times per month. 
Then, each insurance company, which conducts thousands of reports, its price with Audatex. 
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it came out of the assembly line, only through its chassis number. 
Audaglass focuses on the glasses of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet which enables outbid on vehicles reported wrecks. 
His statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting tests géo-démographiques or know the problems by brand or model. 
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a mark went to the garage for a breakdown or how many have suffered serious losses for a given period. 
WG Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools. 
It places, among other things, gigatonnes Estimate, which is also intended to experts and provides digital images, as well as access to parts, price and time official manufacturer. 
WG Motive is one of the group Einsa, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of claims, breakdowns or maintenance devoiture. 
The guide WG assessment is a historical reference product on the market. 
The company works with 24 000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.

Since 2007, it is side to the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the benchmark Standard & Poor's. 
Internet auctions of rugged cars 
In October, the group Solera purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles affected. 
The operation has involved a cost of EUR 59,5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could widen next year to 15%. 
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more services to its customers, with the possibility of access to an immense international market. 
This service to estimate and selling exclusively for industry professionals, such as insurance companies, the experts, the leasing companies, garages, the scrapyard and sellers professionals who must be registered before starting to carry out operations.

Among its major markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey. 
There are currently more than 1500 sellers and 4000 experts registered on the site. 
It manages 3 000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new announcements are published every day. 
According to the Spanish law, a car whose number of chassis was withdrawn can no longer walk, but on the other hand, some parts that are not impaired, can be used as spare parts. 
The vintage car can be réenregistrées, although they have been withdrawn, after the complex. 
Speciﬁcations garage in four stages 
With the tool Auda-Taller, the company Audatex ensures that the user gets a ball in just four stages: identify the vehicle, seek a replacement part, create a speciﬁcations and generate. 
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince the older professionals, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques. 
The database includes 1 034 vehicles, including 666 of tourism, 109 tout-terrains, 137 motorcycles, 78 minivans and 44 lorries. 
Of course, to use a computer and an Internet connection. 
Once the model to repair identified through its chassis number, a graphic image real model in question is then it selects the necessary. 
The user can include variables such as the price of labour, increases or reductions, then it can make estimates for the client. 
Audataller is not a tool to estimate as AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references. 
The main difference between these two systems is as garages does not include the time of labour estimated. 
The cost of the use of this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be a credit. 
Currently, the company Audatex works for that these images are in three dimensions. 
It is an innovation that mechanics are very positive, because it will, for example, to select a door and turning to see the face.
