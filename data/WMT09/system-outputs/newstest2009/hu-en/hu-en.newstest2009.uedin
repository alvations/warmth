Single pengeélen: MP3 players v. mobilok. 
Segítünk, how to choose 
While nearly all mobile is capable of lejátszására MP3 files, may not be a single MP3 lejátszóval telephone numbers. 
It seems clear EBBŐL, only that it is better to buy the phone. 
In spite of much of the reason for this is that the man to separate MP3 lejátszót. 
The use of the election and the future of the method depends on the owner's. 
It was difficult to obtain home is likely to be all-singing, my dear, that the most recent Maxim Turbulenc listen to the plate. 
On the one hand, to such musical products do not appear in bakelitlemezeken, but from the point of view of the quality of the existence of any objective reason not to. 
If, however, are full of art polcai rock, jazz or blues bakelitlemezekkel, is likely to be such lemezjátszóról dreaming. 
This is similar to that of the intended journey, that is to say, "a compressed MP3 music. 
Here, too, there are the price and quality categories. 
Some may be an unacceptable lejátszóért issued eight thousand crowns, as a Pink Floyd and is likely to be difficult to adopt a twenty red-crowned fülhallgatót market. 
The two extremes lay little margin for error, which everyone there was enough space between them. 
Wide of the choice. 
It is also a matter of the life of the elements 
A couple of high quality music pick-up is capable of much more than the simple lejátszása music, but also, in which the majority of the mobilok even by accident. 
One of the present is not a universal, like the telephone. 
The primary functions, the Telephony and SMS input, music, and video also can play, both of them, there is a jobb-rosszabb camera, or even whether navigálhat. 
And if we have to take into account the smartphone-okat kommunikátorokat and, will be at the little desk in his pocket. 
"This is a small miracle, does not know any of the fridge and a television grillezni can't fire off his Nikon at. 
The more functional mobilnak because there are disadvantages. 
The more a function of the mobilon, the display of the töltőhöz several times more. 
And the one of the largest energiazabáló zenelejátszás. 
Music is capable of KEVÉS mobilkészülék lejátszására ten or twelve hours for a longer period of time, for the most part it is much less. 
In this respect, the music players (in particular, the simple) is significantly greater teljesítményűek. 
It is therefore necessary to the cheap mobiloknál, a couple of hours that you will no longer play. 
Moreover, even if she phoned here and there, to get the job for the sake of a töltőt "this also applies to the expensive equipment. 
The MP3 lejátszóknál will not be such a problem, even in the worse it in at least 9 hours of continuous operation by a. 
The music of the Next problem mobilra feltöltésénél arises. 
Unfortunately, the devices have only a limited part of the universal USB konnektorral in addition to, and not all of them directly to the computer without special software. 
Of course, the music directly to the memory card which conforms may be, but only a few kártyaleolvasó birkózik adapter and without the use of a miniature memóriakártyákkal mobilokban. 
The lejátszóknál except a few (iPod), there is no need for any special software. 
Enough of the apparatus of the disconnection USB-n filled with music. 
Most of the players and the mobilok already on its own, the rapporteur, the album-, a name, or, for example, on the basis of an evaluation of the order of a user's music library. 
Only a few of the device is the subject of the Windows Explorerhez fastruktúrát, iriver (and a few of the both of you know, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, clever, telephones operating system). 
For the players to be easier, the more they mobilok 
The specific device érdeklődjön selection, in particular, the life of the battery, the memory capacity, the hangkimenet quality and type and, of course, the necessary treatment. 
If the music you háttérként primarily intended only for a short period each day, and he was listening to, for example, the tram, any MP3-at pick-up mobile also complies with you. 
And this really any mobile is capable of. 
It was not particularly closely, the mobile or the pick-up in the format of the music. 
Each of the MP3-al language to cope with the music and the vast majority of just such a format. 
The MP3 and outside of it is one of the most popular ones being for the vast majority of the WMA format for the music too. 
For the Apple (the AAC format used by the company and iPodjára) less. 
The better mobilok also allow, for example, in the online zenevásárlást. 
The mobil-interneten enough to see through the service provider (or any other service) corresponding pages and to buy the song or album. 
The service, that in itself may be a reasonable argument for the purchase of mobile music. 
Unfortunately, the service providers supply and, more generally, it shall be limited to only annual rádióslágerekre. 
Of the prices are the lowest. 
Generally, however, it can be assumed that the music was of such sales (or GSM-n, Internet, or wireless Internet) will dominate the future through the zeneipart. 
The majority of people always retain the mobilkészülékét. 
He liked to hear something bármikor, the mobilját feel in his pocket, while the forgotten MP3 pick-up at home. 
Even that, however, depends on whether the fülhallgatókat hordja-e always with, or at least the kihangosítókat. 
If not, the built-in speaker, which almost all mobile, but only a few MP3 pick-up. 
Many of the musical mobilok is likely to be the maximum advantage of the price. 
As a general rule, the three thousand koronánál kevesebbe legolcsóbbak. 
The crown of between three and four walkmant fair enough to acquire. 
Mostly, however, you to restrict the traditional fülhallgató kimenetének absence. 
From a technical point of view, and the best of the best equipped with the telephones of conventional 3,5 mm in diameter apertures fülhallgatókkal fifteen thousand koronába may be either too. 
At the same time, in addition to the advantage of the players on the simple management. 
The simplest - it is not necessarily the cheapest players választékunkat (see) of it all. 
MINIMÁLIS function, the cassette magnóhoz resembling normal gramofonhoz or management is obvious. 
There is no chance of the collapse in the form of the mobilinternet, and the subsequent huge adatátvitelért as regards the bill. 
Not the device 
The cheapest mobiloknak (e.g. Vodafone 527) is opening in the interchangeable memóriakártyákra (M2, microSD type, etc.). 
The appropriate card hozzávásárlásával easy, up to a maximum of two thousand koronába. 
But it must be careful. 
Only the sourcing supply of the maximum capacity of up to 2GB of the cards. 
The only arrived they know what to do with the 8 GB memóriakártyákkal. 
And even if it is mobilja lejátszót would buy cheap MP3, take the Cowont, the Creative-ot, the Sony-t, the Samsungot, or irivert Emgetont. 
On the basis of the capacity (max. 2 GB) should not be more than 1 in 100 koronánál költenie. 
The more if you'd been having trouble with students, choose a more specific mobil-walkmaneket (Sony Ericsson, Nokia and Samsungok). 
A separate MP3 kezelőgombjuk these devices are so close to the comfort of the treatment of the MP3 lejátszóét. 
Far from the sector in the Sony Ericsson, which is the same user interfészük mobiljainak series of walkman, like the MP3 lejátszóknak sold separately. 
The abovementioned brands MP3 lejátszói can offer the same service, according to the same four thousand koronáig, but more memory capacity (or 16 GB akkumulátor-élettartammal) and (usually 15 hours, up to a maximum of 35 hours). 
The first virtual service provider Csehországba it before the end of the year. 
Perhaps it 
The relatively advanced and szolgáltatóink csehországi mobilpiac virtually the same services offered as part of the Western partners. 
In spite of this missing something here for us - the classical service providers of its essential to virtual service providers. 
Perhaps it will not be long. 
The website had often megírtuk Mobil.cz that service providers in Europe and the Czech Republic are among the arrived. 
This is also confirmed by the ČTÚ, which attracted the attention that the SMS prices of other országánál Bohemia is dearer to the Union. 
The European Commission after the entry of the recent roaming charges for unsatisfactory situation, so perhaps - the Czech Republic shall consist of a few customer mobilszolgáltatók sms-ek küdött from abroad will be cheaper than the hazaiaknál. 
How is it possible that the csehországi compared with the prices of such a high? " 
The answer was simple, missing the fight which competitor. 
This sounds ellentmondásosan perhaps, because there are three mobilhálózatunk penetrációnk and the high above 100%. 
On the contrary to the mobilszolgáltatók complain that the Czech market extremes of competing. 
This often agree with Paul Dvořák, the Czech Republic, the Office of the President of the Council of telecommunications, who previously stated several times that there is no place in Bohemia to another service provider. 
Perhaps, it is true that the classical service provider's own network is now likely to be too much of a chance; however, it is likely it was difficult to even find the frequency). 
But there are, however, still a possibility, "the virtual service provider. 
He was taken to virtual service providers in the entry mobilpiacra significant price depression, which followed the classical service providers also reagálniuk. 
While the big fish are still on the market before the date of the entry, as well as, for example, the Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, similar to the Great Britain mienkéhez voices. 
However, it was found that such service providers and, indeed, they are to be successful. 
Be példáért, however, did not go too far. 
In the year you were informed of the virtual provider Mobilking indulásáról in Poland. 
Not quite half of this service during the year, he was also subject to more than 100 at a customer and the fifth largest szolgáltatóvá. 
In the meantime, the financial group behind the Penta Mobilking consists of Bohemia on which the U: Neither owner. 
The advantage of the virtual operators target group focusing on the possibility of a much narrower. 
For the effective operation of the traditional operator client is much less. 
Not because of the relatively high építési-, mobilhálózat-üzemeltetési and maintenance costs. 
The virtual service providers in the world so generally low költségűként appear to offer a "cheap calls and sms-t, which, however, often less ellensúlyoznak service. 
So, for example, the Mobile versenytársainál the Tesco in Great Britain at least fifty per cent cheaper sms-ket offers. 
But as the Poland Mobilking example shows, it was enough to be a good bet. 
This is the service provider will focus on specially for the men. 
"The real men Mobilking shall be elected the service provider, who, like them, who could," says David Seibert, this virtual provider of mobile operator Entertainment Company chief executive officer. 
NEHÉZ tell whether the idea of lengyelországihoz beválhat-e too similar to those of the rest of us. 
Miroslav Čepický, the Vodafone spokesman in doubt: "The Czech Republic the market relatively small szegmenses megközelítéshez, which is based on the majority of the virtual service providers. 
In addition, in the case of the supply of services for the relatively fulfilled. " 
Esélytelen Bohemia, the mobilszolgáltatók shall 
It seems almost certain, however, that, if there will be a virtual provider of Bohemia, not the Mobilking. 
"This project to be successful terjeszkedéséről talk, but do not appear to be in addition to the negotiations Bohemia keltőnek hope. 
For the Mobilking régiónk rather than other countries to take place, "he said in a telephone interjújában Mobil.cz-nek Jana Studničková, spokesman for the Penta financial group. 
This indirectly, confirmed that the existing mobilszolgáltatók csehországi not sympathized with this idea. 
He was, on the contrary, all power to them to do so, in order to ensure that there will be any potential competitor. 
The GTS Novera group is not a time for it to be in the virtual service provider, which intends to take another step to do so, in order to ensure that the company Telefonica O2 in the field of real versenytárssá clients. 
"It is very interested in us, not only to ügyfeleinknek fixed, but also nyújthassunk mobile telecommunications services. 
And as soon as possible, so much the better. " 
All of this possibility we mobilszolgáltatóval repeatedly in the Czech Republic. 
Of them néhányukkal had made the least progress in the negotiations, "says Paul Kaidl, spokesman for the group. 
It may be a better times to come. 
No official information, it appears that the first virtual service provider was either by the end of the year, we can. 
However, the birth of an impenetrable wall of silence "around. 
"At the moment it is not, so that the total value of the service provider would be the virtual market place in the Czech Republic. 
The Czech Republic to the rest of the market, in contrast to the market very special. 
He had not called us egyletlen, in this area most of which are complex and serious project szubjektum offering, "said the Mobil.cz-nek Vlastimil Sršeň, Telefónica 02 sajtóosztályáról. 
The special situation of the market, as referred to in the Czech Republic to the rest of the service provider. 
Martina Kemrová, the spokesman for the T-Mobile O2-vel strikes, exceptionally, he said: "I have not one viable and bilaterally jegyeztünk favourable business project, which could be based farther." 
And, he added: "The T-Mobile network by the end of the year, it is unlikely that any of the virtual Atlantic. 
At this moment I had sat on our tables at one time should be a specific agreement that, in such a short term can be to think. " 
The attention of the Vodafone rather than 3G licenckövetelményeinek toward the performance of his own. 
Miroslav Čepický within this: "We are open to the possibility of negotiations to virtual service providers, particularly in the field of sharing the costs and infrastructure. 
From the point of view of the public that the legkifizetődőbbnek. 
The Vodafone chief strategy in this area of the rapid mobilinternethez partnertalálás shared networks to build. " 
The agencies FELELŐS - a string of the service providers 
The procedure can be easily megérthető mobilszolgáltatók, another service provider to the entrance of the competitor would increase, and that would lead to a reduction in the price declines nyereségeik. 
So why should such a competitor's könnyítsük? " 
When the providers of something, it is important they are able to cooperate, the testimony of the U: Neither the birth of waiting around. 
The maximum pressure in the ČTÚ-ra T-Mobile would be likely to result in the company's U: Fonjának around birth. 
They the ČTÚ honlapjáról the publicly available information. 
But now the U: Neither comes well argued that the virtual service provider, why not allow entry. 
Martina Kemrová this, he added: "The mobilpiac konkurenciájának surroundings recently meghatványozta mobilszolgáltató appears on the market at the end of the fourth. 
Having regard to the nature of the csehországi mobilpiac, it is apparent that there is a new player on the market, and the high level of services entrance támasztana requirements. " 
Having regard to the mobilszolgáltatók such hozzáállására straight, however, so the total érdektelensége regulatory bodies in the Czech Republic. 
In the meantime, it is not only the ČTÚ hozzáállásáról, which, unfortunately, "Great Britanniától Bohemia, and by way of derogation from other developed countries - there is no right to interfere with the economic race. 
This is the opinion of the Economic Competition Authority shall be entitled to. 
But the agency, however, his attitude to the whole of the problem. 
"The virtual service provider mobilpiacra would be possible only after the date of entry to the conclusion of a contract between the provider and virtual mobilszolgáltató increasing the necessary infrastructure. 
He had no such contract has not been concluded, because of the possible supply of the traditional service providers are likely to be interested in accordance with was not interesting, "he said in response to questions Kristián Chlapua, the Council, the Economic Competition Authority external Osztályáról. 
People the service providers are likely to be set out in a statement I should not be surprised. 
The agency, however, which would represent the interests of consumers and to take care on the outside, and that no one at the back of the situation on the market, it is more than the odd. 
Especially if you Kristián Chalupa: "Abroad, where the virtual service providers operate normally, it is that they are put on the market has contributed to the reduction in the price of the mobiltelefonos services." 
However, it is likely that the ÚOHS does not fall within the scope of the interests of the correct functioning of the market environment and the decrease in prices for the pressure. 
Shocking indeed, in the case of the three mobilszolgáltató kiderülő reaction quite touching consistency. 
The question of whether it is really only véletlenről, almost, of course. 
Exactly the same as the töltőállomásoknál benzinárak probably the only chance and the hard work of the competition. 
"This is not the case, the agency had discovered the anti-competitive procedure signs, and, therefore, no reason to interfere in any way too. 
Not one of the leading to the service provider's position, that is to say, the market ténykedéseiért proportionately greater responsibility. 
The virtual mobilpiacának service providers are likely to open the necessary tools of the network regulátornak also are missing, "said Chalupa. 
The driver of the presentation of the situation on the market, one of a number of disputes. 
There is, of course, the ČTÚ drawn up by the analysis of the relevant markets, on the basis of which the telecommunications for the sole point of view of competition in the market. 
In such a market and then, of course, is one of the leading provider of the Czech Republic. 
Some legal experts, however, other approach, "the virtual also offers a service which is still subject to approval by the network operator. 
And the mobilszolgáltatónak "relatively logically - a monopoly on its own network. 
So, in a certain segment necessarily dominant. 
But even if that argument did not accept, ÚOHS intőnek ought to be for a minimum of three mobilszolgáltató remarkably similar. 
In the meantime, one of a series of complaints from people (including Novera company referred to in the GTS) shows that, in the course of the trial service provider to interfere with the major is very similar to that. 
The responsibility of hárítása ČTÚ-ra telekommunikációban and the relatively normal trick, which the ÚOHS off the hands of the whole affair. 
This was met with a few in a similar situation. 
Unfortunately, the network recently adopted ČTÚ an extension of the text of the law at the time of the powers of the competition in the territory of telekommunikációban could not, although a number of experts that the situation had to be reduced. 
As well as the representatives of the ÚOHS should be able to, but it is likely that the interests of others. 
This is then, when no one was paying 
In the meantime, the operation of a service providers shall remain unnoticed álvirtuális, which already operates a number of mobile networks, of the Czech Republic. 
These firms which own mobiltelefon-szolgáltatási lists, which, however, only partially open to public inspection. 
Because it is dealing with the multilevel marketinggel cégekről. 
So, for example, the Amway, the Bohemia Telecom, the Starlife offered his own mobiltelefon-szolgáltatásokat and many others. 
These firms are generally only on the basis of the price lists the kiválasztottakhoz. 
The magic in the company of classical company ügyfélként against the service provider, which is a large quantities of SIM card. 
Then, as a matter of priority ügyfélként special offers (and other benefits). 
The problem is that all of the Czech mobilszolgáltató prohibit the elővételt similar commercial conditions. 
"If the cases arise, of which you speak, terms and conditions could be megsértésről, which foglalkoznánk, and which the company to complete its cooperation could lead to," said Martina Kemrová questions relating to this problem. 
But rather, it is unlikely that such activity is not on the news would have been responsible for the mobilszolgáltatók embereihez. 
In particular, in the case referred to in the three companies may be more than a thousand words ügyfélről. 
In the meantime, not a single provider of defending against such a procedure. 
Because of this activity is not negligible nyereségük of these is a real and virtual operators "not particularly threatened by way of derogation from its own official marketingjükkel. 
Miroslav Čepický giving warning of the potential problems: "The law allows a similar spekulációkat, however, this only firms in the services of negligible percentage of customers to use. 
In addition, they shall be accepted by the SIM card telefonjukban that included the names, so this may not fully, like the general clients mobilszolgáltatók. " 
But the ČTÚ-nak furcsállnia just as it should be at least. 
In addition, another question arises the ÚOHS. " 
If the mobilszolgáltatók hunynak eye over a similar procedure, why hinder the virtual provider of birth? 
It must be added that the ÚOHS-nak leleplezéséhez such activity is relatively strong powers, and if you don't want, should not be megelégednie explanation of the service providers that there was nothing they could not do such a thing, and that this commercial conditions. 
We shall not be when we arrived at the 
As the text of the times, the virtual providers of services to the entrance of the appreciable árcsökkenését mobilpiacra. 
In the meantime, virtually all of the country, where the virtual service providers were, as in the classic létrejöttüket service providers were more or less. 
They are virtually identical to those used in the arguments were "too little, too much of the market may be pleased, problems with the quality of services, etc. 
In the developed countries, however, these moments in the regulatory bodies, which was not the mobilszolgáltatók, but defended the interests of customers. 
Then, or some of the measures they have reached a formal or informal pressure, concluded that the first virtual provider, followed by the others. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies of the whole matter adogatják each other. 
On the basis of the experiences we can't get the impression that not all of them clear kompetenciák come in such cases. 
But don't give up the fight. " 
If the background are good and the virtual service provider with us soon, it appears, the Czech mobilpiac again, perhaps, is thrown in. 
If one of the service allowed the creation of a virtual mobilszolgáltató, the only difficulty ÚOHS remain indifferent to the rejection of the additional interested (diszkriminációjához). 
And compared with the rest of Europe, we might not, perhaps, no telephone numbers.

They wanted the szudéták népszavazást USA-tól the 
The Germans Šumava szudéta be requested in the United States in 1945. 
This is the letter, which is in the Dél-Csehországi Science Library. 
If we can't be part of Germany, Austria, or, at least in the United States of America we want to live under the patronátusa. 
It turned out that the Germans in 1945 szudéta would a few of the President of the USA. 
This is also a magánarchívumból remaining letter, which is now in the Dél-Csehországi assemblage of Science Library. 
The Germans Česky krumlov-i requested by the US President, not to let the "šumavai county" Csehországnak handed to which even Hitler in Munich, on the basis of the Treaty. 
"The situation was explained and, indeed, they want to be sure the words, which, according to the American troops, the German areas, and there is no elnyomóként, but felszabadítóként arrive," the letter, "Men, who bore the fate of Šumava words" signed. 
Whereas the Csehszlovákiához szudéta coupling the Germans exactly where he was supposed to have knowledge of the national character of the Czech Republic, in addition to the "only brutalitásra, könyörtelenségre, not understanding, and hope and rabszolgaságra may, at the request of the copyright on the designs of the letter to the American president, to take over the protektorátust Šumava" now and for ever. " 
"We do not believe that, irrespective of the four million inhabitants of the opinion of this country would the stranger to the area, which the minority of labour and upsets, and almost nothing would not help the Allies győzelméhez," the letter. 
The reason, it is not the subject of the authors haven, allegedly "Czech elnyomók" bosszúvágyától fear. 
If, therefore, the US President is supposed to entertain the šumavai Germans, in its opinion, it would be enough to keep the šumavai referendumot county, whether they would become part of the inhabitants of the USA and the United States of America patronálása whether they live under. 
Though the text of the letter after the war under the current knowledge of history naivnak slightly, according to some historians, in accordance with the szudéta versus expectations that the Germans. 
If the Czech Republic MÉG sejteniük Germans exactly where, as a minimum, that the country will be in kitelepítésükről, the possibility of this known to only a few of them. 
Some of it is expected that the United States of America and the Great Britain in the kind of autonómiában szudétáknak agreed. 
Megint others have simply that shall remain in Czechoslovakia. 
This proves that Gustav Chalupa, the České Budějovicében born Austrian reporter. 
Budějovicei németként Chalupa during the war, who was a marine in the Baltic Sea. 
At the end of the war when he was arrested and the British holštynskói fogolytáborba, more than a dozen other Czech, German jütt, in order to teach them to csehül. 
"They have been in that, if you will, as well as the Czech language to come to them," said Chalupa. 
Before the war he was living German prisoners of Czechoslovakia had none of the Beneš-dekrétumok kitelepítik, on the basis of the country.

'The climb' and the risk of an accident or punishment. 
It should be recalled the time the risks, "says Martin Kořán, the now Homolce Kórház pszichológusa modes of transport. 
And therefore, it is necessary to the information campaign in the press, in particular, the negative campaign, what the psychologist. 
He was brought to the attention of the driver of the initial signs less effective. 
"If the danger is fitted with a warning sign, is likely to be soon merge with the leaders of the environment and do not deal with him," warned Kořán. 
Olmert then almost all of the West Bank in exchange for peace in the area, 
And Aod Olmer, President of the Government of the provisional Israel occupied in 1967, virtually all visszaadásáról area, i.e., on the west side of the Jordan, and the Golan-fennsíkról Kelet-Jeruzsálemről, in exchange for the peace and the palesztinokkal Szíriával. 
It was a interjúban, "he said, which on Monday the Jediot Achronot napilag published. 
"It must be the palesztinokkal állapodnunk, which means that almost all, if not all the (West), we must go back to the area," Olmert told the napilapnak. 
"A certain percentage of these areas, but the percentage of areas of the Israeli palesztinoknak átadnunk should be similar to that, because without it there will be no peace," he added. 
He admitted that the possible visszaadás Kelet-Jeruzsálemet includes. 
"Who do you want in Jerusalem and, in particular, the level of safety, tractors and knobby don't go through his legs, as one of the best friend, must be to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said, was in July, two of the city to the attack, which killed in the course of a few men and a couple of a dozen of them were damaged. 
The prime minister will be necessary in the old town "in the Templom-hegyre, holy and historical places special solution" to find him. 
"Who wants to keep the Israeli sovereignty over the whole city, 270 000 Arab must integrate. 
This will not work, "he emphasized. 
Of the Golan-fennsíkról desert, 
Olmert said in an opinion of the izraeliek Golan-fennsíkról kivonulásáról, which he sees as a necessary condition for the Szíriával békeszerződésnek concluded. 
This, however, part of the effort would be certain of Damascus. 
"It does not recommend the békekötést Szíriával Golanról solely on the basis of the desert," warned. 
"The szírek well know, that what should be lemondaniuk, Golant to obtain. 
It is to be supplied with current Iránnal; it should be used to indicate the movement Hezbollahhal síita (with), to be supplied to the regular aid which the Hamász síita (movement), the Al-Kaida and jihad (holy war) shall terrorizmusának in Iraq, "the prime minister pontosította. 
After the accident, the questions: The utaskísérők Törvénytelenek enhancing the? " 
You do not know the full extent of the law, they should not be walking around the same time as the main-beam autóbuszban 
The Student Agency company in connection with the tragic autóbusz-balesetével Italian Padova incurred in the vicinity of the question of whether the utaskísérők and passengers autóbuszban közlekedhetnek-e during the procession. 
"If we kept strictly and formally in the law, the steward is consistent with the activities of the transport activities on the basis of the law," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Department of Transportation. 
In the last week of the steward twenty-two years ending in the death of a truck in front of the bus is likely to be caused by way of crossing a chauffeur. 
Unfortunately, the moment the girl sitting beside the driver of the bus of the least safe place, even though it was in place, two additional. 
The bus interfere with, or sudden fékezhet at the moment when the steward for a cup of coffee, or newspaper. 
It is the role of, in particular, whether the bus traffic has állóhellyel in accordance with a licence. 
If the autóbuszban homologizálva there, the passengers they should be. 
The Student Agency of the main-beam autóbuszainak állóhelyeik there; the Aktuálně.cz-nek Jančura Radim, the director of the firm also confirmed. 
"To find a solution to the Minisztériummal megpróbáltunk, and the first movement of the passengers were not allowed. 
However, this has been withdrawn, and that the passengers toalettre during the docking at the side of the road, if his own ülésük, "he said. 
You do not know the law the utaskísérőt 
"There is no the steward for the role of a clear legal szbályozás - no law not governed by this position. 
The carrier, however, there is no law does not prevent the provision of services. 
On the Road Traffic Act of the concept of the co-driver only know; it does not determine the rights and obligations, "added less clearly Hanzelka spokesman. 
Mr Josef Pokorný, the transport ministry road jármű-üzemeltetési Director of the class on the contrary it believes that, in accordance with the law of the problem. 
"Depends on whether the bus is turnover for the approval of the stands. 
And at the end of it, "he says. 
The buses is to be in the city, where he stands, and there are limited to a maximum speed, as well as the city of közöttiekre állóhelyekkel and allowed greater speed, as well as távolságiak without stands and the maximum authorised speed, with safety belts with seats. 
As part of the aircraft, he says the expert 
Jaroslav Hořín, the BESIP utaskísérők movements of the transport safety expert on board the bus when it is not the essential problem. 
"The continuous progress, there is not a lot of danger in the situation of the aircraft in a service. 
It is not sure when there is turbulence and the head of the légiutaskísérő beverheti. " 
"If, however, the bus fékezne, all of a sudden, of course, the physical laws apply. 
In the same way as the urban enhancing or villamosokban. 
The safety of the utaskísérők internal rules must be endangering the carrier, "he says, and also considers that the problem is not yet established for the purposes of the law. 
The termination of the services Jančura 
The Student Agency sole autóbuszos utaskísérői can offer services. 
Two hundred utaskísérőt. 
The director of the accident is not pursing their profession after all. 
"As soon as it is, however, the impression that the utaskísérők risky profession, szüntetem. 
The cup of coffee in the newspapers, and you may receive the passengers. 
Költségmegtakarítás it would be, "he says. 
In the interests of the safety of járműveiben reason for the absence of utaskísérők Alexej Litvin, the director of the Asiana, who compared to the fraction of the Student Agencyvel operated services. 
"There are no utaskísérőink, from the outset ellenezzük. 
Sooner or later, it is a fatal injury, "he said, a few years ago, the Týden.cz-nek. 
Was an incredible tragedy 
The company two years ago, working with young steward of Naples plzeňi died during the regular service. 
The Slovenian lorries are likely to be without the use of any of the direction and blocked leállósávból came out of the path of the bus. 
The bus came to a sudden manőverrel tried to avoid a chauffeur, but crashed into the front of the bus to the right. 
The fact that the utaskísérők for relaxation. the space reserved for the two they would have Jančura refuses. 
"This places the front part of the main-beam járatoknál may not be lefoglalni, blokkoltak." 
In the firm wants to sue the driver of the lorry. 
The Agency for the compensating for the girl's family did not expect the judgment of the court, but the guilty on the part of the financial compensation was expected. 
Törvénymódosítás? " 
Of the distant future, 
The utaskísérők clarification of the movement of the törvénymódosítás jelenthetné on board the bus, which was more than a year ago to work with the transport ministry harmincfős group of experts. 
"The group, however, to any specific results. 
It was not so much the buses, rather than the points system deals with the maximum speed of the motorway and the mobilhasználattal during the management, "says Hořín expert. 
"The Department of Transportation does not like the utaskísérők activities, which are threatening the safety of passengers," finish Hanzelka spokesman, buses that the safety of the police and the competence of employment agencies. 
The hopes of Frankfurton pass Düsseldorf 
The Executive Board of the bank WestLB munkatársaihoz written letter is not the big words. 
The units in Düsseldorf financial institution and the Frankfurt Deka-Bank mergers or transfers "in the capital markets, the central body of savings banks financial group," will you come up to the letter, "to be published on Monday. 
A persistent WestLB in the lucrative "kompetenciablokkot" to take such a shop. 
Such a link to the provincial megadhatná decisive impetus to the banking sector further összefonódásoknak. 
This is the olvasata, in particular, when one of the Management Board of the difficult times the cselekvőképességét intends to prove it. 
Because of the uncertain status of the bank WestLB will continue to be huge pressure. 
Only in the EU Commission, but the Federal Financial Services Inspectorate of the Council, which recently told the észak-rajna-vesztfáliai provincial government, that she had to find a permanent solution to the time limit. 
The savings banks to clients, the investment bases and the famous Deka-Bank WestLB, however, it was a long time between the theme of the sort of relationship "Frankfurt side. 
Franz Waas, the leader of the Deka-Bank already at the end of August, the data ismertetésekor said that the Mainzer Landstraßén in the bank and a provincial bank Helaba, for example, in the case of mergers of WestLB or you don't understand. 
This in spite of a pound of the Board of Governors, which one half of the banks, and the other half of the representatives of the savings banks associations, had commissioned the Management Board, to enter into negotiations with the WestLB-vel to conduct the common business activities. 
In the course of this capital markets in certain parts of the business, or may be. 
The negotiations, however, the financial circles, "shall" had only just begun. 
Reporter 3 of the financial sector, the main employers' belonging to the Deka-Bank is not the first time, the name of the savings banks konszolidálásával sector. 
In 2003, for a moment, it seemed that, in the case of the Landesbank Deka-Bank Rheinland-Pfalzcal and the Helabával. 
The triple EBBŐL arising, however, was not there. 
But the plans have been made, the provincial government claimed the Helaba cited. 
The other two bank after it was unable to find each other. 
Of the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz Baden-Württemberghez instead of the Stuttgart Landesbank. 
However, again and again, and a member of the provincial Deka-Bank came up with the idea of a relationship between banks. 
However, as last amended by Günther Merl, Helaba, the chairman of the Board of the bank mergers against the plans. 
Whether this is the realization that there is a need for the public sector as different banks. 
Now, the provincial gyűlési bajorországi BayernLB and, after the election of the first of the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg with expected. 
The Helaba for this is not necessarily good news. " 
If the pressure for further major increases elfogyhatnak gradually to the potential partners. 
The only entrant's younger been born, and the financial crisis had got through substantially better than the Munich and the Stuttgart banks. 
The fusion of the WestLB-vel Helabában üzletrésszel 85% of the competent Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen has been ruled out by the beginning of the year. 
Better to the NordLB remains. 
The such geo-strategic considerations, however, only one of the two sides of the same coin. 
On the other side of the question is, how they matched each of the banks of different business models. 
Merl said in June that the German savings banks and Zsírószövetség still did not answer the crucial question of how business model should be given to the provincial banks in the future. 
Finally, maybe even the WestLB cutting up, of course, but what there is not intended to be. 
Thus, the Management Board's letter is addressed in the fact that, in the event of a total solution ". 
That this is how the Deka-Bankkal by merger of certain units, even in the future.

The Hypo Real Estate sleepless nights for the creditors 
The German banking system remained relatively stable, stressed the federal Minister Peer Steinbrück still only in the past week. 
MÉG, it was fortunate that the politician, the "relatively" word, and mondanivalójába put it, that the German banking sector not sparing the válságszerű developments. 
Because it was the weekend. 
The subscribed to Munich Hypo Real Estate Daxon (AAD) ingatlanfinanszírozó down loan firm received one of the German banks konzorciumától to defend himself against the market turbulenciákkal. 
A person, "he said Monday that the situation of the Reutersszel, that the hiteltámogatások 35 billion euro rate. 
Of the Hypo Real Estate-nek only after part of the interest to be paid. 
The money is part of the private, partly közbankoktól. 
Losses in the background, the subsidiary Depfa. 
The államfinanszírozásokat Depfa carried out in accordance with a újsághír lent money to projects in the long term, and very short maturities refinanszírozta himself ruling of distrust in the markets, which for now is not possible. 
In the first half of 2008, the Bank készpénztartaléka 2,37 million euro fell 95 percent, and the proportion of their own capital also moderately, 1,6-ról 1,45%. 
The current revenue and net revenue from the pénzüzletekből against the same period of the previous year, fell back to zero, the claims of jóváírásokból and securities, as well as the hitelüzlet proceeds of revenue of more than 70 percent decrease of 5 million euro fell back. 
The group of former Depfa megtérítéséből subsequent accounting of the costs from higher revenue, as well as the illetékrendelet reimbursement of interest in separate groups, and the companies belonging to outlets, was due to be taken for 16% of the revenue shortfall in a relatively moderate. 
The former államfinanszírozó privatizálást in 1990 after the introduction of the first corporate ingatlanhitelekkel speculated, which the Bank Aeral later in isolation. 
Whereas, for the control of classical államfinanszírozással there was little the Depfa, threw himself into the infrastruktúraprojektekbe more, as well as the private investors and the common Following (private-public-partnership, PPP), and he also internationally. 
The value of the subsidiaries of the Hypo Real Estate-nek descriptions must be carried out by a "significant impact" on the team - has communicated to the calculation rather generally. 
In fact, the payment of dividends that has not happened. 
The third of the 2007 dividends already reduced. 
The Hypo Real Estate Depfa significantly since the receipt of the Heads of State and infrastruktúrafinanszírozóvá. 
Compared to the more MÁS pénzintézetekhez refinanszírozástól depends on the interbank market, because it does not have ügyfélbetétekkel. 
The US investment bank Lehman Brothers összeomlásával two weeks ago, the lending between banks, since the banks of the marginal. 
The Hypo Real Estate-nek Depfa hitelportfóliója part of the "euro-effect" refinanszírozásához about 50 billion of short-term instruments a year is needed. 
The Hypo Real Estate, according to the notice of the group financing needs for the foreseeable period of the loan is secured, and the company protected "at the present time, to a large extent the international financial markets with a bad influence." 
According to the sources, the pénzeknek MÁS due to the refinancing by the end of 2009. 
Georg Funke, by contrast, the chairman of the Board of the AAD, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group for a reasonable period of time should not be used to take account of the pénzpiacokat. 
The Federal Republic of Germany, the Federal Bank and Financial Services Inspectorate (BaFin) so that the Hypo Real Estate Group piacképessége now is ensured. 
This gives hope to the shareholders and creditors of the bank. 
But the dynamics of the crisis and felmérhetetlensége may not be sure of it. 
The unthinkable MÉG, that shall not be fully used the funding. 
But the opposite of this cannot be ruled out. 
Saturday, when the late in the evening, according to news of the Bank still stood on the edge of bankruptcy, even the egyenlőre transitional save that he did not know the tempers. 
The részvényárfolyam 3,30 75 percent decrease of the euro fell. 
By contrast, the kötvényárfolyamok rather well. 
While the little change in the debts referred to in the first place, the quotations to back bonds fell significantly. 
In particular, in the light of the crisis, the former subsidiary, the WÜRTTEMBERG Hypo bonds and in such a way as to be achieved by extending the 2009 year repayment terms. 
While the Hypo Real Estate in advance of the bonds of speculative investment alternative, értékállóságukat stabilitásától now in the international financial system shall be deemed to be dependent on the bankválság kiéleződése and to ensure that the financial institution Depfa almost to the take-up of the crisis. 
So long as the banks, governments and the business banks are even less vulnerable to support the system, the benefits may be taken to törlesztéséből within the time limit. 
And, or the, which currently has almost no one dares to hope that the financial crisis could overcome the next 15 months.

Sylvana bentós and the secrets of box 
When he was 16 at the time of the annual Sylvana Hiltropnak Tachibana Highschoolban has to be submitted by the end of the first day of school, girls begin to giggle: The German woman I were "kavaí!" 
That what this means? " 
Sylvana mangákból already knows the word "of the new cserediák-blogban Japánról tales. 
"Of the first day in Japan. 
A very my. " 
MÁR on his way to the school I was in a funk. 
I live on the edge of Tokyo, Kavaszaki, and 40 minutes of the Tachibana Highschoolig travelling by train. 
I was alone in the way, but, fortunately, I was not mistaken. 
It seems that the beginning of the teaching of the Tachibanában shall not be taken as seriously as at home, Alsó-Szászországban. 
The pupils are from eight o'clock becsorogni until 8 o'clock 40-kor short at the beginning of the conversation to the teachers, the words "Home was". 
But before the education, it was time for me to introduce myself. 
And I am not the type who would like to talk to people, especially a 40 tanulóból standing in front of the class. 
Whereas it was not yet the school my uniform is finished, I heard my indefatigable landlady creeping out of an old skirt and blouse, blue and black bőrcipőt térdharisnyát. 
This, then, is the about in the stood in front of him, and I tried everything correctly pronounced: "Szajonara, Vo nor Sylvana" Sylvanának, Germany, and a week later it will be the birthday. 
At the moment, I was very happy that he was a good two years ago, I started to learn the language. 
Both of the 31 girls sugdolózott, giggled and waving, and the "kavaí 'I heard the word. 
This I knew the mangáimból. 
This is the Japanese girls alapszókincséhez, and means that "cuki, my dear." 
And then the my towards that pouring tide. 
The girl smiled broadly sitting beside me, it seemed to him that the cserediákot planted beside him. 
The rest of the hour it was relaxed enough, but when the bell, duly megrohantak. 
Everybody was talking and laughing, and the connection to talk me out of the hole, and the Japanese angolságát rather difficult to understand. 
All the holidays and then he unpacked the bentóját. 
I made my dinner - this is such a completely different than the dull German tízórai sandwiches. 
I got a spicy rice, little kolbászkákat, Cucumber Cleansing algából and a salad, fruit, and in a kind of tofuba meat. 
Most of the pale, I don't know what to eat here in Japan. 
A look of the dishes, and completely new they taste like. 
The fact is, that it was all very fine. 
Well, yes, perhaps with the exception of the salt szilvabefőtt, brrrr!!!!! 
The Japanese schools not only the bentó simply lunch. 
Előfordul, to a girl and a boy, with his own hands, the report shall bentót, which shall draw up artistically, in particular, in the hope that she closer to recognize the boy. 
I read about the manga képregényeimben. 
I am kíváncsi that this megfigyelhetem-e here, too. 
"Why was Japan?" Asked the friends go looking for, when I told them that I want to go to school in Tokyo (for a period of one year. 
I always said: 
"Because it simply seated." 
In the years since the mangákat wanted to read. 
And that allowed the culture and described them better understand, once I started japánul to learn. 
Well, it was quite clear to me that I had to be here. 
Whereas vonzódom the tradition and the custom. 
A great value and these are here. 
The Japanese, on the one hand, the latest techniques and trends in the country - and, on the other hand, disciplined and traditional. 
And whereas all so well organised, yet I have never lost myself, even if it is the biggest city in Tokyo, which I've ever seen. " 
The rat, actors are also. 
A rat or, in the case of the danger of a moth. Whether this means that feels fear? 
Joseph LeDoux neurológus scientist is convinced: The actors are animals. 
But how could it be to examine whether the same!, when they behaved like us? " 
"The Edge" Internet it for a number of years the famous scientists publikálják cikkeiket. 
The Spiegel online in one of a series of "what is it, without any proof that you know of?" Question answers szemezget received. 
I think that the animals have feelings and other tudatállapotokkal, without, or any other that I never would have been able to prove this... Is true, I don't know how I can prove that, in the minds of the other men. 
However, at least in this case, the hope is that all the human brain alapkonfigurációja in the same way. 
However, as soon as other species is tested, and the general perception or the consciousness of boncolgatjuk questions, difficult terrain, whereas the hardware is not. 
When a rat is endangered, the same, like many other animals: Pretending to be dead, or escape. 
The men were in a similar manner, which some researchers are subjective experience comparable to that conclusion is equally important. 
This, however, I do not believe in. 
The two aspektusa cerebral structure makes it difficult for him to their own subjective élményeinket átvigyük the állatokéra. 
The circuits on the human consciousness associated with almost always include the side prefrontális agykérget (the short-term memory and of the implementing / management funkciókban because of its role in). 
This area of the more advanced than in the case of the man, as the rest of the főemlősnél, and, it appears that the full extent of the other élőlényeknél is missing. 
At least one of the the aspektusainál, which depend on the prefrontális agykéregtől, for example, its sense of who we are, or, in the case of the design and decision-making ability to there, it can be assumed that the man had also differs from that of the other főemlőstől. 
A further dramatic feature is the language of the people: Because the human experience a significant part of the language is related to, often suggests that depend on it for the awareness. 
In this case, the animals can be excluded. 
Even if it does not, however, the nyelvtől függene also the knowledge of the language, certainly affect, so that the animal awareness, whatever the nature of it, is likely to be very different from tudatállapotaink legtöbbjétől. 
It is therefore difficult, it can be concluded that, in the case of the other animals in the knowledge of what it would be. 
If the consciousness of the internal and subjective wasn't able to be measured, the special hardware on the basis of their own experiences and not as a result of the analysis, research is a serious problem in front of us. 
Most of the content of the conscious megélés fejtegetésem, but there is also another aspektusa awareness, which is likely to be easily accessible to the science. 
The animals tudati processes, irrespective of the content would be, and this is in memory of the primates for experiments in the short term, in particular the vizualizálás példájában. 
However, this Christof Koch and Francis Crick tested during the assumption by the consciousness of nerve context, like the kauzális mechanisms: Both may be the same, or not. 
This is an interesting way to the prefrontális agykéreg vizualizálás emphasises the importance of the show. 
What follows the emotions of this? 
This will lead to the fact that a emocionális system, like the fear, the aktivizálódik aware of his own activity in the brain. 
What 'fear', and that, therefore, the mental condition in which we are only when the brain activity of localised infections defensive system (or its consequences, such as the physical reactions munkamemóriát). 
So when the emotions are closely linked to the agykéreg of the deck, which the főemlősökre and, in particular, the man. 
The linguistic basis is complemented by the senses are fine, because the words and grammar, by means of the states are graded by, and be able to tell them that, in addition to our own these others leírjuk. 
Antonio Damasio, for example, by contrast, is of the opinion that the emotions of the agykéreg testérzékelési agytörzs and the activities in the areas of the world, as well as Jaak Pankseep, who, however, will focus on the agytörzsre. 
Whereas this network, in the course of the evolution of the human was not very easy to play a role in the overall feeling of species. 
The theory is that I don't know this TISZTÁN disproved, but bizonyíthatatlannak. 
Pankseep considers that the rats and humans fear, it seems to me that, in both cases, it is likely to be: How could it be, to check that the rats and the people the same!, like when they behave? 
A cockroach in the event of an emergency, if he felt fear? " 
Véleményem only similar behavior in accordance with the evidence is not yet of the same cross. 
Although the neurális összehasonítás further help: The rat, similar to the agytörzsük and of the people, on the other hand, there is no csótányoknak in the brain. 
But the agytörzs responsible for the érzelmekért? " 
And even if it can be demonstrated that it would be in respect of the people: In the case of the rats bizonyíthatnánk like this? " 
I think that the rat, and other mammals, but perhaps even the csótányoknak (who knows?) are actors. 
However, I don't know how to show it. 
And whereas the suspected to be fundamentally different from the actors miénkéktől; whereas the human consciousness and based on the language of the special áramkörökön), rather than the rats emocionális behaviour, as I emocionális feelings. 
In any case, that progress in this area of the neurális level, where the rats and in the same measure. 
As I will not, in the case of the rats and the knowledge of the language, the emotions, not because I don't know that there are. 
This is myopic hozzáállásnak másnak, but rather the waves, rather than to keep ütközzek wall. 
I am a practical emocionalista. 
Platini, the UEFA president: Kegyelmi time to Poland and Ukraine 
Ivan Vaszjunik Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister, said that the arrangements for the president and the prime minister's direct responsibility to be covered. 
"The government of the UEFA Ukrajnába ruled the confidence in Bordeaux, and you have to believe that he is capable of Ukraine, Poland, jointly with the organisation of the Európa-bajnokság" Vaszjunik, "he said.

The Dennis Quaid would bribe 
The actress reklámozni wanted a new film, the private interjúban - and now he had the wrong with the former husband. And Ryan Hollywood star házasságtörőnek it former husband, Dennis Quaidet. 
Who would I, and 
Late war of the roses and Ryan - Dennis Quaid ex házaspárnál: The two Hollywood actor after seven years in the case of the ugly fight válásukat intent "before the public. 
Ryan and the American InStyle magazine, where interjúban last week for the first time, the divorce of the reasons stated: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, which caused a lot of pain." 
It was only after the divorce, he knew that many women by Dennis. 
The spiritual sztriptízre Ryan new, "the women" filmjével sajtómunkája was due to take place, which tells the story of a adultery. 
Dennis Quaid has reacted positively to kikiáltására unfaithful husband: 'It', "said the actor 54 years," the New York Daily News' daily paper, explaining, "that we ought to, and the history of our átkölti it." 
In addition, in the "unfortunate" that the common boys for 16 years, Jack repeatedly "remind many of the pain and the change, which is a child of divorce." 
Since the divorce while Ryan lives alone, Quaid married again, and the father of a recently ikerpár. 
It is, therefore, one of the following side thrust sent a reply: "My life in any case to continue. 
Boldognak myself, I know that there is a wonderful family, in which everything was all right. "

This trend is most clearly illustrated by the Paris and in Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37 per cent less than a year earlier. 
The cause of the American Express this low in the dollar, and that "the American tourists travel kedvéhez lanyhuló".

The dark material affect the űrszondák permitted to fly by 
Of a mysterious phenomenon, the researchers tanácstalanságot years. The dark material affect on the speed of the so-called swing-by űrszondák during the manoeuvre. 
The experts from that of Albert Einstein general relativitáselmélete may not be fully correct. 
In the case of the "after" silent, nearly 18 years of the space. 
As soon as the fuel hoses befagyó fagyhalál because of the danger. 
In the years since causing confusion among scientists of a mysterious phenomenon, the swing-by anomaly. 
The swing-by űrszondák by means of the gravitational hintamanőverét, during which the additional lendületre shall a star, such as the Earth's gravitational field of space. 
Thus, the probes takaríthatnak large quantities of fuel. 
The Cassini-Huygens európai-amerikai kutatószonda napszondához after the, also the physical game. 
However, in the years since he was astonished the researchers find: The flying objects were not fully, as the ancient would be expected, on the basis of the law of gravity. 
Instead of disorders occur in the speed. 
One or more of the probes lelassulnak unexpectedly happen very quickly indeed. 
An explanation of the physicists had not found the effektusra. 
The phenomenon anomáliának swing-by was christened the. 
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein general relativitáselmélete may not be entirely correct, in which the substance of the space will be tömegvonzását görbületeként. 
American physicist Stephen Adler, the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study staff will continue to notoriously believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and the swing-by anomáliát to try to explain the so-called dark matter, which the astronauts discovered in the universe. 
"The anomáliáért the dark material may be responsible for which, perhaps, or are also in the vicinity of the Earth," she says. 
The existence of dark matter of the világűrkutatók acquired only ten years ago. 
Nyilvánvalóan to exert a gravitational force, which is the impact of other égitestekre. 
The substance itself, however, is quite invisible, that is to say, the kind of electromagnetic radiation, in visible light does not issue or beating back.

The investigation of the cause of the American államügyészek 
The US chief államügyésze special prosecutor appointed by the nine US district-attorney menesztésének 2006 to investigate. 
The step followed by the fact that the judicial wallet Villefort want a report of the matter by the decisions of the government officials. 
The report shall denounced the White House officials, and the former chief of the law-makers államügyészt, Alberto Gonzalest. 
The test because it was, because it was feared that the államügyészeket menesztették political considerations. 
Nora Dannehy, a special prosecutor to investigate will now that the inquiry heard during megpróbálták-e with officials from the justice. 
"The potential offence it, serious charges was not yet, and it is not," said Glenn Fine, inspector of prisons.

The series began with that, in December 2006, the US judicial tárcája beosztásából removed nine államügyészt. 
In those days, he said, that the államügyészeket was dismissed as a result of the weak performance. 
However, it later turned out that they have received nothing worse than a államügyészek evaluation, like many other kollégájuk. For this reason, many of them, it is concluded that he was behind the easing of political considerations. 
A few of the district-attorney participated in high-level republican congress members of the criminal procedure, while others were not prepared to take part in the alleged against the Democrats, electoral fraud charges relating to the investigation. 
The American államügyészek inquiry is being carried out on behalf of the government to carry out and legal matters.

Is Meat Loaf eposza recognition 
The rocksztár Meat Loaf will receive recognition of the Q awards díjátadó gálán the "Bat out Of Hell" himnuszáért epic. 
The singer, who takes over next week in London at the special aranyfokozatú fee, he said, as the recognition. 
The nine minutes, five seconds of the length of the song Meat Loaf 1977 (5), közönségsikert harvester albumának címadó was the song. 
Most of the Coldplay's mark of the charges, the four categories of the jelöltlistára. 
Paul Rees, the Q magazine editor told him: "There is some of the song, which for the first time or the műfajok crossing boundaries, and the" Bat out Of Hell ". 
Jim Steinman acquired by the song for a very great voice, and that voice was Meat Loafé. 
The song a nearly two-minute orchestral section of it. 
In 1979 kislemezként appeared, and the slágerlistákon 15 of the place. 
However, in the case of Meat Loaf "Bat out Of Hell" for nearly nine years, if it was present at the slágerlistákon, and then more than 40 million copies sold. 
- real name Meat Loaf Marvin Lee Aday - health problems recently., inter alia, in 2003 as a result of műtéten szívritmuszavara, after he collapsed on the stage. 
In 2007 due to acute gégegyulladás had to say some of the concert. 
It later turned out that in the hangszálán ciszta. 
The unknown city street, which often forget, and perhaps soon sell 
More than a thousand sugárútja City-nek of New York, and other mellékútja boulevard. Some of them famous, others merely practical function. 
A taxi driver, however, many of the local inhabitants live here for a long time, and it is difficult to say where in the 'Extra' Place, for the most part, because they had never heard of. 
The small East Village-ben street, and to the north of the First of the street "without that, in the absence of the Second Geoffroy-Langevin - the Bowery and the Second Avenue. 
Approximately 9 m wide and 36 metres long, and much more like a dusty lane, as one of the main transport route. 
There are no utcatáblák. 
Practically may not be able to find a standard on the map. 
There are, however, admirers of the street. 
There is, for example, the Avalon Bay, the recently built on First Street luxusépületek építtetője. 
He wrapped the Extra Place-t again, and he wants to ensure that the new buildings üzleteibe butikjaiba and in order to get a clearer road. 
Among the admirers of the street here for a long time that the neighbors, who are caught in the quiet street, that this was the only one of the residual prior to the maintenance of the country in the past. 
However, the owner of the streets of the town, and the development of épület-megőrzési adhered to in order to ensure it is not. 
This month, the district council területkezelési at a meeting of the Standing Committee on the city and the Avalon Bay representatives have submitted a proposal, according to which the main contractor megvásárolná up the street. 
The committee, however, would prefer to remain in the streets of the city, and asked him to submit a new plan for the next month, Susan Stetzer, the number of local authority body district manager. 
"Very little is already in the possession of the area of the city, and we want to, if the Extra Place by what authority dost thou these continue to stay that way," he said. 
"To come, and for the management of the renewal of the proposals, which may carry out the Avalon, but also that we are in a position to guarantee that remain available to the public." 
A few months ago, the Avalon Bay has announced that he wants to repave the little street again, and would like to squeeze around. These uses a part of a café, which is expected to be the main contractor will hire a area. 
The idea that the Avalon Bay megvásárolná the street, at a meeting this month for the first time had been made public. 
Michele but Milly, the Avalon Bay spokesman told me that, although the company would use the street, not the birtoklásához. 
"The main aspect of the Avalon Bay, to renew the lepusztult alleyway, and the public into a nice place '," she said, adding that the proposed purchase of the city. 
Seth Donlin, the Épület-megőrzési bureau spokesman, said that the city would have liked it to sell on the streets, and noted that the bureau shall be responsible for the development of buildings, and not as a result of the treatment. 
Színesebb turned, the Bowery-hez Extra Place is not a lot, compared to the historical significance. 
In accordance with the Néhányak 1802-ben "no-man's land", when he was a child of countless Minthorne estate, and one of the narrow földsávra did not claim. 
The monument punk-rock closed in 2006, CBGB in the rear exit the Extra Place-re open, and the street was perhaps the most notable that made the Ramones' Rocket to Russia "albumának jackets in the photograph. 
"It was a good place," said Danny Fields, the Ramones menedzsere, who made the photograph in November 1976. 
"It was full of rubbish, ruhafoszlányokkal, hordó- poszterdarabokkal and, as well as the leaves and ropes." 
A few people bloggerek, inter alia, who it was, how he took possession of the middle East Village-et, opposed the sale of the Extra Place. In particular, they claim that the köztulajdon this piece, however modest, must remain in the possession of the community. 
The Extra Place-t ritkaságot than others, one of the city remained virtually unchanged, and which should be left alone. 
Wash your Jeremiah, "in the hand of Jeremias the vanishing New York-ja" ("'book: The extinction, a town in the process of bitter nostalgia" alcímű), the author of the blog Extra Place-ről blogjára put it on a part of the story, which in the case of "The New Yorker" hetilap "City of rumour box headed' 1952-ben appeared. 
The author, Brendan gill wrote: "The Extra Place, a narrow, small cul-de-sac, which was still in the dark, which, rusty iron raktárajtók spalettás area and windows, and the wind in the newspapers, where a week in the canals." 
At the end of the street, with a few exceptions, looked at in the same way a few nights before. 
A rat ran across the street, at the end of the rear door, which led to the CBGB-be a long time ago, and now the place, the higher priced clothing bolthoz. 
Graffiti on the walls, and there was an empty, of 0,75 litres söröspalack lay a runaway, fresh újságpapírhalom. 
A passer-by told me that they rarely get the Extra Place, but do you think needs refurbishment work. 
Fields told me that he thinks some underestimate the attractiveness of the impact of the current state of the street. 
"The best years of my life in the dark, damp and nasty places I spent," he said. 
The bilingual education debate: Continuous exposure to the English language environment, 
In this part of the Oktatásfigyelő Bruce Fuller, and they were Lance T. Izumi represented the views of the candidates bilingual education is discussed. 
They were Lance T. Izumi, who was one of the Asia-Pacific Közpolitikai Research in the California studies experienced researcher oktatáskutatás and the director of the driver, "not as good as you think: Why is the possibility of középosztálynak iskolaválasztási entitled" társszerzője book. 
It is not easy for the Spanish language from areas of voters to go to him. 
Obama down in respect of the education proposals are included here. 
Obama, in accordance with the successful "in the mouth and Spanish students afro-amerikai significantly less likely to acquire diplomas, like the white students," and it is true. 
In order to combat the performance of such differences in education plan specifically supports Obama, inter alia, the "transitional bilingual education" for the English learners. 
At the same time, Obama to the question of whether the bilingual education for commitment, which is in the English language school education to the emphasis, the great teljesítménykülönbségek felülkerekedik-e érdekeltségén in combat. 
For example, the Sixth Street Prep VEGYÜK contractual general school in the eastern part of Los Angeles county. 
A large part of the school pupils in the Spanish mouth and low income. 
More than one-third of the students, who arrived recently in the region - many of the English language. 
In spite of this the fourth osztályosok 100% of the excellent results in the 2008 State matematikavizsgán. 
Similarly impressive, that 93% of the fourth osztályosok performed very well in the English language and literature exam. 
This is not the incredible performance of the value of the device, which Obama will you allow preference. 
The repetition of the Sixth Street, all the practice, the skills and the continuous evaluation of the objections to refuse the emphasis. 
In addition, and that is what we ought to take account of the Obamának, Linda Mikels, director of the Sixth Street, in accordance with the principle of English education the school pupils' full belemerítése "in the language of the environment. 
The method of belemerítési almost exclusive use of the English language teaching in the rest of the article. 
Mikels, who opposes the bilingual education, said: "The overwhelming success to be that if someone be able to walk, no notice, who was in the case of the student who, newly arrived from Mexico in the 12 months before." 
'It', "he said," in the nick of time. " 
If Obama állítaná-e as an example to be followed, the other, a significant number of Spanish mouth and English students to the school student teaching in schools, like the Sixth Street Prep? " 
The results achieved by the school should be clear, the answer, however, because of its own political the oktatáspolitikája (the National Educational Unions have long been supported by the bilingual education), and it has consistently stand on its own, whereas the bilingual education, we can't be sure Obama reakciójában. 
Though I agree that the Carmen to learn English, Obama lebecsülően recently declared the matter, when he said that people should not worry about having as much for the legislation "exclusively English Nature". 
Instead, he said, 'I want to be that the children to speak Spanish. " 
If Obama really wanted to reach out to reduce the differences between the results, should have the models, which operate, instead of lenézné that and to get them. 
On the farm, kiújult because of concerns about the price of oil fell steeply 
The olajárak fell sharply Monday as concerns about the financial markets that America will not know felélénkíteni mentőakció-terve relating to the economy.

In the second quarter of the team bravúrjával rekordját and 
After the last more than eight season the Jets mezében spent more time than any of the other, the defensive position in the End Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all. 
But then he looked at the end of the second quarter to maximize benefits on Sunday, when the Jets meccsé sensational, the game without a point. 
"I've never seen, '" said Ellis. 
After the beginning of the end of the second quarter, that the Jets tepid and the Arizona Cardinals play the total to bring them into line with the towering sky dark cloud. 
Brett Favre, the quarterback 12-yardos touchdown-passzt Laveranues Colesnak. This was a perfect előfutára délutánnak, during which significantly továbbfejlődött emerging cooperation. 
Favre even two touchdown-passzt Colesnak question in the suburb of, inter alia, then, when, one after the other two cornerback fell 10 seconds before the end of the félidő. 
"I'm sorry for their trouble," said Favre all the Colesnak passzáról in question. 
"A good player pokoli. 
Well we had to communicate with each other, regardless of whether it was produced, what do you think of the people. " 
And while Favre labdáztak Coles, the protection of the Cardinals irányítóját, Kurt straightway. 
In the position of the cornerback Darrelle Revis caught a bad throw, and threw it back to 32 yards, which touchdownt. 
Eric Smith, into another passzba Safety player, and he's got the ball. 
David Bowens, linebackernek kiütnie Warner had the ball in his hand. 
This is the last of the change could have been the most astounding point the mérkőzésen. 
However, when the Cardinals had lost 10 seconds before the end of the ball, and the Jets, Jay Feely kicked 20-yardos put Field, the 34: 0: As a result. 
This was the best result, the Jets within a quarter had been achieved. 
When asked the Jets edzőjét, Eric Manginit that jellemezze assumed by reference to the nature of the game, and he said: "The second or third quarter of?" 
When they told him that "the third in both the Cardinals completed 21 points, so that none of the Jets experience," Mangini said: "I must tell you that I enjoyed so much better in the second quarter, as the third. 
Many of the points that we are in a short period of time. " 
The might of its own világrekordját Gebrselassie rested 
The etióp Haile Gebrselassie again showed why it is that many of the best who ever lived in the Central and hosszútávfutónak, when his own világrekordját overthrown in Berlin on Sunday. He was the first, the man who 42,2 kilometres lefutotta 2 hours 4 minutes. 
The plane of the comfortable on the track, 2: 03: 59 victory Gebrselassie achieved during the time improved 27 seconds of 2: 04: 26 previous results, which reached in Berlin last year. 
Gebrselassie at 26 of his 35 years in the field of many a világrekordját claimed that, in the case of the 1500 métertől maratonig világbajnokságot almost every term, or világrekordot. 
Last month, he had not told the Beijing in Garazim maratont Gebrselassie in retrospect that - perhaps excessive manifested itself has proved to be, so that the further aggravate asztmatikus air pollution problems. 
Instead, she's entered the Berlin maratonra. 
"Almost perfect conditions for days at a time, in the first 9 in ° C, and, in the end," Gebrselassie won 13 in ° C on Sunday, it was incredible, 2 minutes 56 seconds per hour. 
Since the initial 'maratonon not previously, such as Gebrselassie, and the Kenyan Paul Tergat távok turned toward the more, the record of more than two minutes after that stretch has decreased in the past decade, the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa since 1998 in 2: 06: 05-es results obtained in Berlin. 
The Sunday after victory in the riportereknek Gebrselassie told him that two weeks ago it seized the two his, and he could not train for up to two weeks. 
NYILVÁNVALÓ, that the kényszerpihenő found during, and not in fact. 
"So I am glad to see you," he said Gebrselassie the riportereknek. 
"All perfectly formed. 
A week ago I train again, and I were today, but in the end, that's all right. " 
It has received some criticism, particularly in Kenya, Ethiopia kelet-afrikai riválisától - that there are too many implements the versenyei, as a general rule, avoid many of the world-famous maratonfutót, hagyatkozik iramfutóira, as if his wits would have run on the track and the világrekordokat before the encouraging. 
However, this was hardly the criticism that would reduce the hosszútávfutásban Gebrselassie. 
Four Kenyan iramfutó Gebrselassie on Sunday, with 1: 02: 04 under reached the halfway point had come. 
Two of the leading edge of Kenya, and James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi Gebrselassie-nak gave the rhythm, after the iramfutók they were tired. 
Not much more than 4.8 kilometres before the objective is one of the last sprinttel lehagyta Kwambai-t Gebrselassie, who was second at 2: 05: 36-tal, 5 minutes to improve individual legjobbján. 
Kamathi came third in 2: 07: 48. 
The women's competition, the birth mother kazahsztáni Mikitenko, who is now a German citizen, is a remarkable year for the seventh fastest, 2: 19: 19 in 1859. 
In the case of the British Paula Radcliffe was attempting to keep 2: 15: 25. 
The past 36 years in the spring a surprise aratva Mikitenko won the London maratonon 2: 24: 14. 
The Beijing olimpián because he could not take part in the alleged hátsérülése, but quickly recovered, and won the Berlin maratont, where five minutes improved individual top. This was the third távfutás stretch, which participated in. 
He won by the competition: For the first time, that a party of four Ethiopians and kenyaiak előretörjön group, and to make a profit, and approximately 30 km, after traces of them. 
The etióp Askale Tafa Magarsa was second at 2: 21.31-es from time to time, while the Helena Kiprop of Kenya was third in 2: 25: 01. 
In a separate city, black pride of trial and 
In the case of the Greater Orlandóban élményparkban "within a few miles of everything, a loud and powerful" is a quiet town, where the afroamerikai életélmény because of pride and were born. 
Eatonville, the first purely black city, which the country beintegrálódott, Zora Neale Hurston and which was the home of childhood, is no longer so simple as 1935-ben wrote: "Five of the lake, three krokettpálya, 300 brown skin, 300 a good swimmer, and two of the city of school guajáva, without prison." 
Now a place of pilgrimage. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee had held annually in the Zora-fesztiválon. The eatonville-i ünnepségsorozatot Harlem-reneszánsz in one of the most famous female document, Hurstonnek in his honour. 
And yet, in many ways, and turistalátványossággá described in the city - which made the project, to be issued by the Federal Íróinak Válságkorszak útikönyvben Florida is separate from its ". 
The same independent, dignified and bezárkózó, like the 1930-as years when Hurston in accordance with the writing of a Florida, urban blacks often were not willing to share the true thoughts of the white people who know so little about the rest of us, so that they don't know what they're missing. " 
MÉG in the course of the year, when the black candidate for the Presidency, down Obama wants an open discussion of the issue of race, here in the faith in many of the looks of outsiders. 
"It is very ügyelünk, how to tell our tale," counting the 59 annual Hortense Jones, who has lived here all his life, and the city's oldest member of the church. 
"It would be right to tell you." 
It had been a long time since the Eatonville-t paradoxonával victory and the struggle. 
At the historic model of kiállásának blacks, while, at the same time, a nearly 400 people in a community where the szegénységi reached his indicators of the national average. 
RÉSZBEN literary hub, and partly as a result of the example of the US of slavery, sometimes looked down, sometimes not, south, urban black culture, which, in the shadow of the thriving. 
It's not surprising, then, that the inhabitants of the proud and védekezők here at once. 
The picture of the Eatonville-ről Zora and since it is important for everyone so Hurstont (here). 
The real strong dialektusban wrote books, like the "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937) szülővárosát in the world, "he said. 
Five of the Florida útikönyv transformed them out of the city, which lies near the road to the 17. This is the road leading to the Florida long forgotten centre of the blacks and the human drámáknak history, one of the sites. 
Hurston, who both live and the literature was brave, like the drums, led the field in the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke in, and then looked the more her. 
So he wrote: "We find the road to the right of the modern public school, on the basis of the brown and white with carefully kept in good order and játszóterekkel udvarokkal, which Howard Miller gondoz, though he can scarcely to read and write." 
The widow, Dash made mention of the new husband, and wrote that Lee Glenn "to all sorts of drink, and anything which may be necessary for the temporary accommodation." 
So the question is associated with a few hundred Hurston Eatonville-t brought the autonomy, but at the same time, the írástudatlansággal, and the szexszel újraházasodással. 
It is clear that the sleeves and útikönyv showed otherwise. 
The description of this really did not like everyone else. 
"I think the things he said, Zora, as they were in the '," said Ella Dinkins 90 years, one of the Johnson girl. Them with the immortal Hurston added that cited the slippery songs, which the men of their beauty of the singing. 
He added: "This is a man she did not like." 
Hurstonra here still remember, as the living különcre, who often visits, after his family moved to the Florida Jacksonville-be. 
The 77 years Augustus Franklin, recalled that when Hurston and stormed the city, in general, without notification received a thundering Chevroletben, cigarettázva and hosszúnadrágban in a town where people still proud of the stately öltözködésükre. 
With most of the people, "said Franklin, but many fitymálták. 
"People always delighted, if they Zorát," Franklin said. 
However, the Sabelia terrace to the lake, where she was the most likely to Hurstont, chair of these added: "Never left too long." 
Hurston when they died, he was poor, and the books had not been issued again. 
It seemed that the rest of the world together in large part of Eatonville forgot about it. 
Although it was ever popular author, Langston Hughes of his contemporaries, and the only black woman Főiskolán the Barnard of the 1920 Treaty of years, was buried in an unmarked grave in the Fort Pillow Pierce-ben Florida, where he had lived. 
There were no significant megemlékezések Eatonville-ben, or large, public felolvasások. 
"It is not, I think, is that understood how much enriched the world, or that what he had left us at all," said Valerie Boyd, the Hurston-életrajz issued in 2003, the "Szivárványba in", author of the book. 
In the case of a came in 1980. 
Orange County officials ötsávos wanted to build the road through the city on a two-lane High Street, instead of the Kennedy Avenue, which was an important role in the life of the community. 
The expanding Orlandó already had connecting Interstate 4 with the states to the west of the city. 
The proposal came when a heavy Eatonville lábadozott even after a period of history. 
He forced integration, inter alia, by the end of the community a relatively idyllic isolation. 
In the years of racial keveredéssel 1950-es fighting megízleltették relating to the community of the hatred. 
"Then came with a bunch of white boy, and megdobálták inmates at the edge of the road and oranges and other things," said Franklin. " 
"There was a lady who died of it. 
I was thrown out of a water in a car. " 
In 1955 as a result of the "The Sentinel Orlando" Hurston questioned the wording of a letter he wrote to the supreme court decision requiring the violent integration. Thus, the "Brown v." Board of Education "decision:" I'd rather be than my respects. " 
Today, the residents say that the schools deszegregációja was positive that in some respects, the eatonville-iek összetartását whole-hearted, and undermined confidence in the young. 
"The black children, hugged her that I remember them," the man in the morning, and at night, he embraced the tanárát ', "said N. Y. Nathiri, Dinkins daughter, Ella," why It Eatonville Közösségét "as a designation of the Executive Director of the non-profit organisation. 
"This lasted until the students and teachers, were the common place '," he added. 
"Not the white tanárunkat öleltük, because he is a white teacher was," I mean cultural differences were between us, "said Nathiri. 
However, the human rights of many other Zora Neale Hurston helped felemelkedésében - a black írókéban, színészekében művészekében and who felülemelkedtek the above vulgar prejudices, as she did, so cheerful confidence and lines, such as the following: "How do you know anyone who robbed the company élvezetétől!!!!! 
It is incomprehensible to me. " 
In 1975, Alice Walker had gone to see every Hurston's meaningless, and began to fight in order to return the reputation. 
Five years later, the könyvesboltok polcaira a Robert E. Hemenway written by a recognised Hurston biography, which include again from the heart of America. 
Just then the road construction project, the most famous of the daughter of Eatonville when drawing attention. 
And this time, Hurston megmentőként old neighbors looked on him. 
The community began to organise a Hurston-fesztivált in 1988, to show what the főútvonalával tönkretenne in the county. 
More than a thousand and two years later in the inaugural event, and since many of them return to the celebration of all in January. 
A few years later, the county JÓ javaslatától stopped in the road. 
"The main road because of the community ötsávosítása, full speed, which means a real civic pride," said Nathiri. 
Boyd put it more simply: "Zora Eatonville-t saved." 
A victory over the road project, helped the city's portrait megváltoztatásában established himself. 
The increasing number of appeared outside the city living, such as Rachelle Munson lawyer, who began to go to church here in 1993, and the people humbugged revalued on an item-by-item basis to the past. 
Eatonville in 1998, has been in the national historic list. 
In 2006 to open the new single Hurston-ről library, and (of course), and afterwards the újraburkolt Kennedy Avenue. 
Continue to Florida kakukktojása Eatonville remained: Not only ten km from Orlando, but sometimes it is the feeling of a man, as there would be in a suburban summer rain; a small, as when the black family of 27 of the combined years he founded. 
(Today, of the 90% of the black.) 
MÉG shall always caution that the outsiders, the history of Eatonville, for his coming here. 
The most interjúhoz prior authorization is necessary, and a few things, such as the oldest freskóját Eatonville, in which a white man painted and it represents blacks, working in the fields, "shall not be cached. 
Many of the Eatonville-ben, inter alia, the self-assured, Professor Jones, who was particularly fond of the lively piroshoz "fear that their distinct misunderstood. 
And yet, as the Hurston-fesztivál and wider, the pride of the szülőváros also perplexed. 
The young people increasingly KÜLÖNÖSEN Eatonville-re are regarded as Hurston saw his own species: Amazing, and all the problems with no better, no worse, the same proud, kreatívnak, szorgalmasnak, a fool and zavarodottnak, like the rest of the racial and ethnic groups in America. 
Frank civil ties is Franklin's nephew, who, in the words of the 18 years of Edwin Harvey-nek, who plans to return to the college after carrying out, that the local communes, or work in relation to the force, which he said they were the help. 
And, it appears the younger learned Eatonville-t correctly described as, for instance, the 11 of the annual Winter Park-i ikerpár: Alondra Kenon and Alexia. 
"Most of the others, who only átutaznak here, do you think that this is nothing compared with the rest of the city," he said recently after the Alondra Kenon church on a Sunday. 
"But if somebody stops and sledge, a little time to learn the history, it is a very nice city." 
We here in New York all speak the language of the finance 
On the surface nothing had changed. 
If the tourists would not the újságárus bódékkal and the great televíziókivetítőkkel the Times Square again, they would not see, that are in the middle of a storm. 
Never come to think of it, the through, in the shape of a hive of agencies over the heads of the bankers and kockázatialap-kezelők, who is in New York, one of the most difficult days of living since 1929. 
The couriers still végigzörgetik teáskocsijaikat metal on the sidewalks, while muffinnal laden with plates of the morning meetings. 
I always csoszognak MÉG of Spanish men between the tömbházak human öszvérként ötvenvalahány carrying kivasalt shirt, which átvetett shoulders, resembling igához loop. 
Still, the office workers are in the morning of the sweet péksüteményükért ételeskocsiknál standing on the sidewalk, still it is impossible to get a cab and Sundays between 4 and 7 in the afternoon. 
Not that I felt it would be any crisis, until Thursday afternoon, in spite of all the baleful news, not I had made up my mind, that's a new bank account. 
"I deliberately so, to the rest of the afternoon at the time of the thing, JP Morgan chase bankom local fiókjában, or 20 man, however, was standing in the front of the line. 
It is not the bankpénztáros window, where money can be included in, or paid to her but the customer services, where the older clients csekkfüzetet, hints of the tourists' the Macy and shop, and where the new customers to open a bank account. 
Many of them to me - I Starrtól later, 'to me, "the banker - were in line with the same as I do. 
However, by way of derogation from me, they had less money in the foreign as, for example, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and in Staten Island, the. 
The money was taken out of the so called takarékbankokból things (which, like the building societies), hitelszövetkezetekből, and the little takarékpénztárakból, only one in which they operate, and the supposed to be treated as one of their customers. 
In the past year, 15 such bank went silent. 
In the past few days, the Washington Mutual, a 327 billion dollar capital csődgondnokság has been the subject of a bank, and when the New York weekend hazaindultak on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, 440 billion dollar amount of savings sought bankmentő kivásárlót. 
The front of the shop and office workers, the fear of another collapse of a bank, took over the money, which seemed to be perceived as safe, in the bank, which is the most tőkeinjekciós kivásárlást carried out by the Wall Street. 
The simple New York men during the last few weeks have the pénzügyekben szakértővé. 
A woman at the local Chinese telefonján spoke as the Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and the great to be guarding vaults vezérigazgatójáról chopsticks, Dick Fuldról, as if a lazy kollégára should 'e complain. 
Lyn, and the apartment háztömbjének uniformed, the fifties years were changed the subject, not now and Angelináról Bradről, or élelmiszerszállítmányomról talked about, as we do. 
And he said to me, after the bank was: "All the money I saved money market instruments. 
I did not promise. "

Paul Newman is not so attractive America without 
"God, sometimes a perfect people. 
Paul Newman was such. " 
The quotation from the actress Sally Field, but the victims of Newmannel worked on films, and it reflects the astonishment and impotence, which the American moziszakmában Newman's death, and the whole of America. 
And how hard the Oscart. " 
He retired in 2007, 
And he was known to be patient, 
But even so, everyone by the death. 
"Sometimes it is impossible to put our sensibilities, and I now have I lost a good friend," she said, in tears by Robert Redford, "the existence of this case for the rest of my life, and the country." 
No one had feared that it might be ridiculous or too. 
The movie and the home of one of the hero of a dark period in particular was gone, the terrorism due to market conditions, and the fear, the American önbecsülés desperate search for and the dignity of the facility. 
When such difficult times and many easily lose their virtue and very little remains of a man, whom we know to look up, it should not be Luis Cernudának enough to Paul Newmant csodáljuk. 
In the eyes of the people and the platonic szépség- igazságeszményt. 
Richard Nixon, and lost and gained formal hostile protector matters was the eldest son of the deceased kábítószer-túladagolásban set up in memory of a domestic nature of the drug alapítványtól bioélelmiszer-márkájának pending. 
Valóságos was a gift of a country, which could hardly be exceeded nutritional kultúráján suicide. 
Over the whole of the overwhelming csodálathullám Hollywoodot nemzetiségekre and irrespective of their origin. 
The last James Bond, in accordance with the English Dan'l detour; then Craig is not a man, but a era died with him. 
Another English, the Oscar-díjas Sam Mendes has stated that the common work carried out Newmannel clearly career crisis, "she said. 
Russell Crowe, the Australia Newmant rosszfiú came straight to the maximum ihletőjének called it. 
"It is very high, and he made for us all," said George Clooney, who is one of the few, who followed his attempt to Paul Newman: And you shall require a serious and kameráktól distant life. 
It is not always easy, if at all possible, in the midst of the médiadzsungel today. 
But there are those who try to, and the long and Paul Newman. 
Once, divorced, but after fifty years lived in Joanne Woodwarddal faithful, and he certainly would have had a number of the hűtlenségre. 
"Why no hamburgert elsewhere, where the meat from the roast at home? '" He jokes. 
The heaven that he should be proud of him, one of the daughters of fan mail, on the ground that in America, it is not too high.

Route of the Madrid olimpia delicate 
It was, indeed, a Madrid olimpia sokunk dream, and when the 2012-es failed, it may be that we will be 2016. 
But, I ask you, we are really up for it? " 
Because if the futóversenyből yesterday, I think, not at all. 
It was a perfect competition, but I think it was the worst I gather she's got the many, which I've ever. 
Értelmetlenségek nations, and if I should be assessed, and I'd like to the examination, clearly failure would be the result. 
But one, and we'll start at the beginning. 
The serial number of the take-up of értelmetlenségek, because it had come earlier. 
This in itself is not yet a problem, but if we are to go before the man, at least to all at once (the chipet, including the subsequent in order to avoid a job). 
Well, this is not what happened. 
For the first time, has been granted only through the serial number (first nonsense, but less so to go) and (the usual line after the job), how surprising, but it was a T-shirt s-es (second nonsense, whereas I was on the point of XL-es méretem)!!!!! 
How in the world we live in? " 
Or as a result of the crisis, it was decided the substance and only spórolnak cheaper, small pólókat? 
But never mind, these are the things still unsubstantial compared who snub at the end of the day. 
Beyond that, it had to go early to take the chipet, the date of arrival in the line for 15 minutes, and even the knapsack was given. 
The waiting for 35 minutes longer, it is more than that of a man who, in the case of 11.000 head for figures. 
Therefore, as might have been expected, started the competition, and it had not yet the knapsack. When he succeeded, was worse. 
In addition, the rain yet, in the form of more than 40 minutes of waiting, and which népfelkelési stand-támadási tarkítottak trials. 
"I think tomorrow 500-an so sure of pneumonia, as well as some people, including myself, not the actual időnkkel possess the helyezésünket. I suppose that the chipem wrongly recorded the departure. 
If the perfect futóversenyről kérdeznének me, this is, of course, I wouldn't want to the chance. 
I think it's so unnatural in Garazim reverie of a well prepared for the city. 
The Microsoft (virtual recepcióst) for 
What the feltörekvő Technológiák-konferenciáján képfelismerő Microsoft on the basis of a new system and the development of human interactions, a sort of "not too intelligent, artificial intelligence, which is capable of carrying out a task, however, a few fundamental. For example, he is a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, the company to a vehicle in the territory of the conversation kihallott) on the basis of the information. 
This is the "registration" a camera and a form and arcfelismerő capable of using the system to recognize that many of these are in the room, who they are, in fact, also notes that what he was dressed as a bear, "and kihallja beszélgetéseik kulcsszavait and understand. 
In addition, the conversations grouped together on the basis of the breach. 
The receptionist videón showing the woman identified by a third person, but he knows that it is not the company is talking to him, and he was not an employee of the company. 
Ask, I shall be sure to visit and that he would soon be in such a hurry to help him. 
It was all the blue nagyképernyő. 
Fascinating. " 
This is, of course, but in the future. 
Currently there are more important to the company, for example, the development of a new operating system, Windows verziójának. 
At the end of the week, many people think that the Microsoft strategy. 
The Windows 7 will be less and less additional programme. 
Steve Ballmer realized that if the számítógépeken instead of trade in the eyes of many of the necessary futnának programmes, five times faster than the machines would be "Bravo, Steve, and that was something. 
The spanyolviaszt, given that Microsoft had all new functions and split them open for us, plus the Windowshoz extrákat attached to it. 
The open of the goods. 
The Microsoftnak right, the operating system needs to be more and more background, and the software. 
When the Google Chrome came to the net, and I joined the elmélethez, that the Google made the first step to that of the Windows konkurense. 
Many well known, a browser that is not part of the operating system. 
Always the operating system will be required, for the essential element of the hardware and the software párbeszédéhez. 
To fill the same role, as your wife or husband, when you wanted to say something about the mother-in-law. 
This is so. 
Never will not disappear, but the operating system, provision should be made for the "death", not an absolute, but in relative terms. 
Ballmer statement this week that is supported by the idea. 
The people getting less attention will be paid to the operating system, and more and more of the webböngészőre. 
Only the computer to connect it to the Firefoxot megnyissuk Explorert or the "or the Chrome-ot böngészésre - and more and more of the time, like that of the windows in the world. 
And also, together with the system in a large part due to the applications? 
The less sometimes more. " 
And the Windows 7 is less, much less to be the Vistánál. 
KEVÉSBÉ, less leterhelt, less complicated. 
The Microsoft aims to integrate into the online services, and to eventually become the Google-lel alternative. 
Need every bit of it, and I'll tell you one example of why. 
The photo at the beginning of the month in which it is a part of a Microsoft-alkalmazottak Redmondban. 
A poster to the üdítőautomatán calls them, use of the company's böngészőjét. - "The you böngésződ. Our future." 
In 2006 by an independent investigation has shown that the Microsoft-dolgozók 66% of the Internet böngészéshez Google-t used. 
However, in the last week of the Windows Mobile 7 new verziójának slide was announced. 
It was not at the beginning of 2009, but in the end, but rather 2010-ben. 
The Windows 7, Microsoft would be likely to result in the Windows Mobile (7) and the combined market dobásával would try. 
After all, the mobile increasingly számítógépként also functioned. 
But the skid, given that the Android and the iPhone are already on the market, will make their way to the event. 
Marcel Fabuleux down 
This was the Costa Azulon Pablo Picasso, Leonardo di Caprio Bloody gyémántjában Edward Zwick, Al Pacino and Francis Ford Coppola Keresztapájában, and this is one of the Gay vásárlóközönség kigyúrt alapöltözete. 
And if we had the különlegességek felsorolásánál, like the man with the mustache felidézhetjük vándorcirkusz súlyemelőjének could open. 
But what we're talking about it? "Is not something else, like the" typically small and sleeveless - pamuttrikóról man.

And both the comfortable alsóruházat belong to the category, 
Unfortunately though, alsóruházatként that they must be. 
To too good, "he said.

The women in the third world, the fate of the odds, I know it's not impossible.

1001, the stresszoldó number 
Not in a 1000, but to 1 000 and in a way that the chaotic and troublesome hétköznapokból kikapcsoljunk. 
The good news TOVÁBBI, that all we can find out a book, which is 30 September of the könyvesboltokba, to bring the rest. 
The morning was almost óracsörgés 7-kor, but even worse to, what are you up to life at the end of the day as the day in the world today. 
The tension, the name of the office, and the számítógépé hátfájás. 
Of the stress of the 21st century népbetegsége. 
But the daily control of fatigue and the workplace problems when not one and not in two ways. 
No, this is exactly equal to the number of 1001-gyel. 
The jóga-pozíciókon, the classical masszázson or the 'SpA "treatments too Susannah Marriott's book offers a wide range of options, that everyone in the most megtalálhassa and free perceihez may be a solution. 
The work of the stresszoldó 1001 relaxation method shall be borne by the title and the rest of the Alhambra y DK kiadóból Pearson is the könyvesboltokba. 
If you are convinced that, in the workplace or the personal relations, could be the stress out of the world, the manual will in all probability be yet in his faith. 
Indeed, in addition to other idea, which all the ellazulást, grave, for example, how the crawler or how to prepare for the future of up to 100% of the natural food. 
If he was going to be too low in the body of stress and adrenalinszintje felfrissítéséhez problémájává became central to the life of the time in the big chair hátradőlni, ellazulni and concentrate on the reading. 
Those who speak, 
Speaking to a few of the children of the night. 
I think it is not those who felriadnak awake and tell what had happened that day, but those who sleep in the meantime, they say. 
The phenomenon ijesztőnek it might seem at first, but in reality, it is perfectly harmless. 
This is the kind of alvászavart somniloquismusnak. 
A frequent, especially among children and adolescents. 
One said he was sure that he spoke of the night. 
As regards the frequency of can be fully rapszodikus (such as occurs only once a high fever for each), or rendszeresebb (daily, weekly or monthly once) and, in general, the next day the child couldn't remember anything. 
Is not due to the appearance of a single leading to the ground. 
Other alvászavarokkal often, for example, rémálmokkal night felriadással night ágybavizeléssel (enuresis nocturna alvajárással) or with, but it is not inherent. 
As already mentioned, due to the high fever, or even stresszhelyzet kísérőjelensége status or raised indulgence. 
In any case, he had little geography. 
The intensity of the speech is also very variable. 
Be quiet, calm, consist of incoherent words, mormogásból, but in contrast to the attitude, it may not be possible to shouting and crying hosszasabb or in the form of speech. 
If the phenomenon very intensive, it is advisable to the child and szakemberhez. The investigation likely, there is not a great fear in the background of the challenge and the solution to the problem, so be it. 
As already mentioned, it is a phenomenon, and there is no remedy, not unless the alvászavar, together with any other, can form or stresszhelyzettel álmatlansággal (for example). 
On the other hand, a few things we can do it, there is a bunch of preventive measures: 
Let the fact that the child to remain calm before going to bed. 
It was not toys and avoid that the child félelemkeltő agresszívebb or look at yourself or series. 
The ellazuló, ma'am or difficult to teach children to a few relaxation method, that it was easier to find the inner calmness. 
This should help the child to the more sleep. 
However, if he begins to sleep, try to keep the temper. 
Don't let the child to this harmless, and the next day, they won't remember anything. 
Useful advice, 
Not to awaken him up to the child. 
It would be fölösleges, because the child is not tudatánál, but the from kizökkenne. 
Despite the fact that he was talking about, in fact, go to sleep and rest. 
I don't remember, if it is accompanied by a strong anxiety several times in the course of the phenomenon, it is advisable to turn szakemberhez or, what's the is a high level of anxiety. 
If you are talking less clearly (the case), don't forget to asking him anything about that. 
It would be unnecessary, because he did not sleep a conscious, to collect his thoughts. 
On the other hand, you only hear the speech, but he did not see the álomképeket associated with and, therefore, be cautious, and heard the interpretation of the possible conclusions. 
"Don't ever say the child, who know that night to ask the secrets. 
At MÉG. " 
This is a very great anguish. 
And, therefore, the most important not to worry, it's only a few minutes epizódról harmless. 
The Illhaeusern VÉGRE train 
HOSSZÚ Mélyrepülés Illhaeusern after the party at the new impetus, completed the victory and domestic track again. 
Though there was no's match, the sárga-feketék have been several times, taking advantage of the last one from which they could win. 
It was not the tempo of the match was too tight, whereas the attackers had difficulty in the corresponding rhythm. 
The first shot in the hands of the visiting team captain, Kauffmann and, in the distance, however, only just touched the ball in the top corner of kapufa. The predominance has been Illhaeusern, and followed the shots: Fonderflick a distant he tried, and then shot over the gate Hirn. Romain spiccel, Diebold is also a distant experimentally and tried to shake the Dannemarie protection. 
On the other side of the players a blokkba defended the középpályán passivity, and the only thing that has been lövőhelyzetbe örökmozgó Riahi. 
The beginning of the second félidő would be of crucial importance: For the first time Riahi Temporale and has been placed on the side of the Dannemarie. Immediately after the first score was born: Diebold kipattanó ball after the first shot of the excellent helyezkedéssel illhaeuserni Marais, then the door reminded him of it (53 minutes). 
The Illhausern gólszerzője did not, however, for a long time to enjoy the glory: Twelve minutes later, he was forced to leave the field, so csapattársainak emberhátrányban to continue the struggle. 
But the Dannemarie did not benefit from the advantages: Did not much care for the national team, who were just a little bit back to reinforce their. Alone tartogattak some excitement in the final seconds, when large kapkodást after the ball had been very close to the kapufához.

Obama won the first television duel 
The two American candidate for the Presidency Friday, followed by another in the first debate, in which I had to decide that John McCain or Obama will be added to the peaches párbajból győztesként. 
Not surprisingly, the republican and those responsible for women, both of the Democratic campaign, said the victory in the television duel, which accompanied by one of the American households. 
But political analyst David Gergen, according to John McCain action was respectable, it was not proved to be enough, "lenyűgözőnek", in order to be able to decrease népszerűségének: This is the elnökválasztás surveys of the five weeks before. 
The Gallup, according to the institute is better than the Democratic candidate in the fight, according to the results of this opinion poll published on Saturday ötpontos McCainnel is in favour of the Obama (44% and 49%). 
The most calculating, even among an electorate megkérdezettek 39%, according to the Obama will win, while 25% did a McCain victory, according to a survey by the CBS made. 
Obama is expected to continue to increase the advantages of párttársa, Joseph Biden that seemed so it szereplésével. Biden is the first and only public discussion of riválisával, Sarah Palinnel. 
Bill Clinton, however, that the weekend had warned: "It would be wrong to Palint alulbecsülni. 
Are would JÓ. ".. 
In the seventies for McCain should never loses his own, is a vast foreign policy experience. However, stresses the enemy "naivitását" in these matters, which is the focus of the first personal találkozójuk. 
"It seems, Senator Obama doesn't understand that," said more at the time of the attack. 
"I do not think that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge of the presidential position," said McCain. 
This is the main attack on the surface, which in the case of a republican kihasználnak tv-hirdetések since yesterday. 
Obama on the other hand, the emphasis on the fact that he represents the future. 
Let not embarrassed himself: Összeszedetten and that's exactly what it was. 
He stressed that it must be able to make good decisions in the world and to restore the image of the United States. 
"McCain is still not understood, but Obama was" yes "," retorted the weekend with a Democratic ad, which says the republican leader over his eyes, that he had still not up to the crisis in the US "street people 'impact. 
"Ninety minutes of the debate, it was John McCainnek during a lot to say to me, you, however, nothing, '" Obama said yesterday before the twenty thousand people, who had gathered in a driving rain-storm Észak-Carolinában the electoral meeting. 
MÉG not only out of the mouth of the "middle class" or "workers". The financial world created a situation Obamának, no doubt, whom the Americans are the most likely to be able to save the farm on the edge of collapse. 
"The next week may prove to be fordulópontnak '," said yesterday, Charles Schumer, the influential Democratic Senator. 
The Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, the veteran Clinton-kormány one of Obama as "the holding of the animal in an excellent ösztönökkel", as Bill Clinton at the time of the 1998 financial crisis. 
The Democratic candidate for the Presidency in the eyes of the present crisis, "the final award of the eight years over a period of bad economic policies that George Bush has created and supported by Senator McCain." 
The Illinois senator again confirmed that, in spite of the fluctuations of the stock will be able to reduce the 95% of Americans adóterheit.

Minsk: "You noticed that there is an election going on?" 
Young people and ellenzékiek appears on Sunday evening in the Belarusian capital square, is expected to reject the results of the parliamentary elections. 
On Sunday evening after the close of the szavazóhelyiségek hundreds gathered in Belarus in Minsk square, that the election results tiltakozzanak against falsification. 
Even though the results have not been published in a number of young shown Alexandr Lukasenko against President, one of the following words: 'A dictator but, say it!!!!! ". 
Some of them to even went to vote: "Why would I?" Would do the szavazatommal, what they want! "Says a young. 
The tüntetők do not believe that the regime, which the foreign observers tried to appear before the light in the European Union, networking, with a view to a democratic rendszerváltásra would be ready. 
If the election observers condemned the clean, feloldhatnák penalties for the country, under which the driver has been refused a visa to the 40 in Belarus, and a few of the bank account befagyasztottak. 
In accordance with the opposition in the elections, however, were not clear. 
"We were kept away from the electoral committees, and you may lay to that part of the szavazatszámláláson megfigyelőink not, '" said Jurij Potyemkin, one of the twelve Pártból, so very heterogeneous United Democratic Forces koalíció spokesman. 
"The changes were only névlegesek" Alexander Milinkievics stresses, the 2006 elnökválasztás pro-európai opposition candidate and the leader of the movement. "The point is, that the votes of the number, and in this the executive power. 
If any of the delegates of the opposition in the parliament, the means that he had just been appointed, not elected them. 
But the parliament in bejutásuk allows it to place the television, ülésezhessenek törvényjavaslatokat and the regions of the country. 
The scene ellenzéknek and, therefore, should be the political life, because "shall be initiated a dialogue with the European Union". 
Because, if the crisis with Russia seriously eladósodott against our will and we are not able to megújulni, with the risk that Russia, under the sovereignty or jurisdiction. " 
On the other hand, what we want to be independent. " 
The opposition fears that the election monitor the progress of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to be valid, the result of the vote. 
(2) stress that the participation rate appears to be too high and wide of the preliminary vote (which Minszkben 26% of the voters move the opportunity to participate in any open). 
"You noticed that there is an election going on? '" Raises the question of szociáldemokrata Alexander Kozulin, who made his free in August last year the prison where she was housed in the form of a political nature. 
No one of the szavazóhelyiségekben. 
And the opposition in the parliament will be representing more than five years before, and those who are in accordance with the opinion of most of the leadership. 
In the stillness of the night of October Square again. 
The television and Lukasenko Chairman and members of the central election commission örvendeznek everything. 
Again the safety of blood. 
Yesterday, the celebrated the 10th anniversary of the creation of Héma-Québec. Dr. Francine Décary President woman had good reason the ünneplésre, because the Héma-Québec now one of the world's safest and most társaságává donation. 
And that is the most important: Visszaszereznie had the confidence of the people, which are heavily swayed in the 1980s and 1990s botránya relating to infected blood. 
It is known as the Canadian Red Cross blood services to be handled by the national vértartalék immunhiányos syndrome (HIV) and the hepatitis C viruses infected in the 1980s years. 
The drama of the general and the Government of Canada in February 1994, after comfortably muted, Horace Krever, to judge by official examination. The purpose of this was that derítsenek light, the circumstances which led to the while, and formulate proposals to avoid similar cases in the future. 
While Krever judge delayed the submission of the report, and a few of their own has established a committee, the purpose of which is to a new vérkezelési system was planning to Canada. 
The Committee Québecben Gélineau filled with this task. 
The Gélineau- Krever-jelentések and came in response to two blood service in Canada: One of the Québecet Héma-Québec serving, and all the rest of the province and the two territórium Canadian company responsible for the care of blood. 
"When the Héma-Québec started in 1998, the activities of the men he had 38% of Québec confidence for the blood system," remembers Décary back to the doctor. 
The situation was desperate. 
"In the next few years, however, the improvement of the safety of blood and had to be carried out in the area as a result of the work of the people the confidence of visszaszereznünk." Décary proudly says that at the beginning of 2008 québeci nearly 94% of the population of the Héma-Québecet was reliable. 
Décary doctor, however, do not forget that, "the trust is a fragile thing." 
The Héma-Québec on 28 September 1998, happened since the formation of the principle of prudence. 
In that period, the number of cases have been discovered in Europe, at a time when the kergemarhakór, that is to say, the new variánsa Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease also infected people, "says the doctor, who since the creation of the company in 1998. 
"Fogalmunk sem volt róla, hogy it propagates the disease by means of the blood. 
It is therefore the Krever- Gélineau-jelentések and one of the most important recommendation támaszkodtunk. So, if we are uncertain, and the risk of serious disease, the exclusion of measures should be term. The present case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which causes the change in the brain, and inevitably leads to the death. 
It is, therefore, not in April 1999, we take blood from persons who, since 1980, more than a month spent in the United Kingdom. 
And a few years beyond all doubt, it has been established that the disease can also spread through blood. 
This is the case, we are convinced that it was a term meaning the principle of prudence. " 
The market appeared in a technique, which makes it much more sensitive to HIV-vírus diagnosed. This nukleinsavteszt (NAT), which is directly related to the amount of blood shown on the acceptance of donors to the virus, and not produced antibodies against the virus, which were previously used in the tests. 
The Nat lerövidíthettük ablakperiódust by means of the test, in which the megfertőződéstől until the virus by means of technical, we know we have to show the blood, "said the expert. 
The end of the period for a period of less than a week. 
So significantly reduced the risk that the acceptance of donors who, in addition to the vérállományt megfertőzzék, and that it may not be disclosed. 
These developments will be greatly reduced the risk of the spread of AIDS in the risk of blood transfusions. 
At present, the risk is that someone HIV-vírussal infected blood, one of the 12 million. 
"Másképp terms, this means that 12 million blood should be kiosztanunk, until someone the HIV-vírussal megfertőződik. 
Whereas the Héma-Québec 400 - 500 each year shall distribute thousands of blood, more than 24 year should be allowed to bekövetkezzen that in such a case, and one vérkészítményen fertőződjön HIV-vírussal through. 
I think that, whoever may now quietly, or may be used in order to restore the health of vértranszfúziót Héma-Québec "to be the leader of the first number. 
"The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of the termékeink. 
You never know how a new agent shall be entered in the system. 
It is only in the last year, on the island of Réunion, appeared at the chikungunya-vírus, which the Nyugat-Nílus-vírushoz rovarcsípéssel similarly to the blood. 
Therefore we should be on the alert constantly, "said Décary doctor, and stressed that, in addition to the constant vésztartalékokon Héma-Québecnek should be sufficient to ensure the minimum reserves. 
"The needs of the ageing of the population increase. 
Whereas the agresszívebbekké anti-cancer treatment, the patients often need to replace or vérlemezkék erythrocytes. 
The population öregedése blood donors have an effect on the standardised, because of the network, in the number of persons suitable for the acceptance of the québeci only 3% of the population. 
However, for each of the healthy, at least 18 years of age, the person who satisfies the conditions of eligibility to give blood, all 56 days, that is to say, six times a year. 
An average of 14% of the candidates have not been adopted, or because of, for example, are infected with malaria AIDS-szel., who, in a country where malaria kills, acceptance shall not be eligible for a period of one year. 
"This is the 3 per cent tartalékunk so that we meet the needs of the hospitals. 
"It's very rare that kifogyunk the stocks. 
On the other hand, the number of blood donors in the 50- to 100-fold concentration to be to such an extent as those öregednek, after a while, because they may no longer blood. 
But it is very difficult to persuade people to give blood, but even more difficult for them to keep and make that a regular véradókká. 
In the world today, one of the men was barely an hour to go to give blood, "Francine sajnálkozik Décary. 
The annual budget of the 297 million dollars Héma-Québec farmer not only blood products, but also provide human tissues, such as, for instance, csonttranszplantátumok, szívbillentyűk, szemgolyók bőrszövetet and tissues, which is almost exclusively used in the case of persons with severe burns. 
They shall be analysed the tissues, reform and freeze, and then the Héma-Québecnél, őssejtbankját Québec, at the same time, which is only open to the public. 
Once the only medical waste treated köldökzsinórból obtained from a blood, which őssejtekben rich, so serious diseases leukémia (for example) the handling of permits. 
"A few weeks ago ünnepeltük, was that the köldökzsinórvér-minta bankunkba, and more than a thousand new sample of each year, we see. 
At the beginning of the year, it is likely that in the future, we will have to offer these szervátültetésekhez "laid Décary doctor, who, in accordance with the köldökzsinórvér-levételi programme is very popular. 
"Many anyuka sad due to the fact that there is no possibility of this" - and so it is, is not in a position to Héma-Québecnek whereas the Québec kórházában all available to the complex and costly program. 
The IMPACT elődöntőben scores would no longer " 
The Montreal IMPACT team yesterday, 3: 1 of the defeated the Seattle Sounderst USL-1 selejtezőjén, and the aggregate 4: 3, with the elődöntőbe. This was the second and összeredmények negyeddöntő mérkőzése is crucial for which the Saputo stadium has been made.

The northern Charest efforts 
The kormányfő does not preclude that, before the start of the election year 
Alighogy ended the Liberal Party gyűlése, Jean Charest yesterday was the québeci Jean-Talonba, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), the victory kept the interim election. 
"Even the last great northern borders": This is the ambitious long-term goal in Jean Charest Lévis-ben québeci the Liberal Party held yesterday at the speech also gazdagították visual elements, at the same time, the President tried to concentrate on the point. 
While he's behind the "Moulin à images" similar képsorokat vetítettek. 
The three giant screens fascinating film followed each other: Vízerőművek embodied, bányaművelés, Québec "Google Maps, maps." 
Such a spectacular devices are sown during the periods of choice. 
Moreover, the on the kormányfő refused to guarantee that the election will not now megkezdődni this fall, though he added that the timetable very close. 
"The northern plan" at the end of the fourth for the mainstays of the kormányfő Québec relating to "víziójának," which is a "new economic area 'incarnates. This is a France with munkaerő-egyezményt, one of the Agreement between Canada and Europe and more Ontarióval includes the proposed Convention. 
The last time the North (i.e. the degree of latitude 49) begins in the northern area of kormányfő beszédeiben often included in the opening, but this was never held on the subject. 
Confined to only the államfő, however, that explained why he is "full of opportunities for a huge kincsesbányának." He did not, however, the időtényezőről, investment funds, no specific importance sorrendről in respect of the projects in the future. 
Only a few of the development of high opportunity: The vízerőműveket, and in particular the bányászatot erdőgazdaságot, which shall continue to élénkít felzárkózóban of the countries in the increase in public infrastructure and the reconstruction. 
To the north, "in nickel, zinc, copper and platinum, gold, silver, iron, Titan and diamond," Charest was. 
This is the area in which "twice as big as France", "is our land, Québec area. 
Not only the rest of us, but in us, "repeated the államfő, emphasising that it intends to create a national founding myth. 
Underlined that Québec északkal in the development of the relationship: In many respects Abitibiben, the québeci tervezőmunka, the James-öböl. " 
"This is our future!!!!! '," he added, after a pause, he looked at the opportunity in behind the giant map. 
The Québec 70% of the territory of the Labrador includes a part of the North, which demanded Québec always himself, "said the kormányfő the. 
"This is the historical állásfoglalásunk, which all the government confirmed. 
A line LÉTEZIK, for which there is no agreement for a long time now, and if the chance, the same resolution on behalf of the Government and I again ', "he said. 
Másrészről, "in the light of climate change we must again through the északkal nézőpontunkat relating to" the kormányfő átjáróról to the northwest, which, as a result of the thawing of the polar ice is opened every year. 
In accordance with the opinion of the kormányfő, in the new geopolitical environment, the area was an important task. 
And what will happen to the őslakosaival area, the's and the Eskimos? " 
The kormányfő stated that the Government of Québec priority attention to them, and the plan uses a form of will, in particular, the young people. 
Two of the various pártokhoz minister, Pierre was, and Michel Létourneau ungavai Coast Québécois (the latter was an emissary had already begun) of about thirty consultation with the local community. 
He began the operation of the Benoît Pelletier miniszterközi led the committee, in which Julie Boulet (közlekedésért and natural resources minister responsible for the important role). 
The kormányfő does not preclude a major meeting, "does not necessarily Summit", where "to create a common vision." 
However, the development of the north would take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. 
The North Plan, as part of a coordinated, and also set out in the system will be environmentally friendly, "said the kormányfő. 
Jean Charest wrote, such as the "vision", as it is in accordance with which the previous Liberal prime ministers half-imagined. 
"As well as the former liberals, we also another: Our goal is the kihívásokból that the aim of the new opportunities for growth and development." 
This was one of the recurring theme of the hétvégének, which Jean Lesage pártelnökké 50 megünneplő anniversary of the choice of the big koktélpartival began Friday. 
One of the decisions adopted the suggests that the Beauharnois erőművet Adélard-Godbout gáttá kereszteljék. 
"Pártunk politikusai, inter alia, of the Hydro-Québecet Godbout founder, the quiet revolution and the dissemination of national implementing vízerőművek Lesage, or the James-öböl atyjaként Bourassa known to all knew how to debate the future '," said Jean Charest. 
On the other, quoted a "true conservative" work, and John Diefenbaker, prime minister between 1957 and 1963 "Roads to the North" programme. 
The station gátjának Eastmain1a-Ruper Charest in relation to the plan President, it stressed that the commissioning 2012-re planned. 
"This to us, but I plan to be there," he told supporters, and a statement received loud applause. 
The prime minister, who said in April that it would not be an election 2008 and probably 2009-ben, did not rule out the possibility of a vote to be held this fall, in spite of what the law allows. 
Stressed, however, that the naptára now is full of, the tasks for the federal Board meeting of the Chinese and the Québec-New York summit. 
At the end of the week held for President of the liberal pártgyűlés has proved to be an excellent platform to make their views known to the decisions of the nationalist claim, which approved szinte gondolkodás nélkül. Here, especially in the case of the "constitution törekvésekről relating to": The liberal party, in particular, "of the specific nature of the Québec" requires recognition of the Constitution. 
I would like it if the Québec nevezhetné Canadian radio network, and members of the Board, and these are the members of the Québecben vétójoggal they decisions taken. 
But the opposition szkeptikusan Plan of the main points of the North. 
The Coast Québécois leader Pauline Marois észak-québeci again raised the development policy, which introduced the Landry-kormány in 2001. 
In accordance with the Marois liberal government came to power in 2003 has refused the application of the provisions of this policy. 
If they did not have, "now far ahead of him to be," said Frances Mercure-rel Marois, with the agreement of the woman, whom the Jean-Talon-i stand as a candidate in elections to be held today. 
The opposition party ADQ, that the government of the North to adopt the Plan. " 
"What we want to believe, however, if this is not a mere" would be ', "said Sébastien pártvezető Proulx, who leave the Monti Dumont-t returning today. 
"It's a levelek disgrace country 
Vic Toews, the Harper-kabinet minister (besides "judicial" minister last summer), the fact that he had the courage to Louise Arbourt Canada "called" call. 
So to a woman who had always fought the csodálatunkat deserves justice and all - that is, yes, a lot of people, and the surrounding the Prime Minister Stephen of Harper himself. 
What is it, then, that the government, in the west of the country who has not only the home of its own national guantánamói concentration camp. 
This is the part of the government, which is an absolute does not take into account the fact that those felrótt bűntények Khadr to him at the time when it was committed, was a yet. 
This is the only one of the government, which, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, and refused to leave the word that a gyermekkatona sínylődjön inhuman conditions. 
The only one of the government, who was doing the igazságügyből bábszínházat, while a prisoner was guilty. 
Emlékezzünk only to the fact that the UNICEF, the Amnesty International and the Canadian lawyers' association also require those hazaszállítását Khadr to Canada in order to receive a fair process. 
Government and blind eye over the tortúra: It does not matter that a young felnőttet tönkretettek completely right now, and of the many years of torture is likely to be sealed the fate of a lifetime. 
Now, even though we are not aware of this, but currently the take, freedom and treacherous pusztítása demokráciánk. "Democracy": Harper, this time he says the word out of the mouth of the empty szólamként he merely sounds. 
But the time came when he was no longer there is no morality: Arbitrarily - but they may beat me, plague and bebörtönözhetnek any Canadian citizen at the head of a government, that he was a minority (and even after 14 October, what next? "). 
For many of them it believes that the find a pártnál, which the virtues of the Law and Order vanity. They did not see that this is the government of the values set his feet, and the dignity of our reputation. 
Toews kedves, rather than this, "it is a shame not to seek elsewhere. 
The Barrick Gold orwelli vélemény was speaking " 
The Le devoir számában megjelent a letter of 17 September, Patrick J. Garvertől, the Canadian Barrick Gold mine elnök-vezérigazgatójától assistant. 
In response to the me immensely Orwelli Garver declares that the world's largest aranytermelő company sued three of the six million dollar slander against a kispénzű kiadóvállalat author and said it was a "public debate" in order to initiate. 
Although the member shall be impartial and independent judges, the courts, in particular to the decision to "slander" is not the truth, but shall be taken on the basis of the law. 
Not surprisingly, Garver that he was silent about the fundamental differences. 
Indeed, the Barrick Gold to the public debate would be the best way to ruin anyone who would be contrary to the position of his own? 
Regardless of the outcome of the trial was one of the authors of a book entitled Noir Canada and kiadójának költeniük significant amounts of the control of the fight and should be an unequal battle, where on the other side of the bányaipar almost inexhaustible undermine support for the army of lawyers. 
Such unequal struggle, often used the tactic to destroy the defendant and friendly arrangement, which not only the ellenkezőket elhallgattatják, but even félemlítik those who megpróbálnának again deal with the question. 
If the Barrick Gold really wanted to public debate, it would have been more to the public before the views of operates. 
Although a number of other countries, where the Barrick Gold activity in this otherwise, the parties to the arguing in Canada are generally not up with each other, but the thoughts. 
Therefore the bányának would have been enough to open the books and files should be retained, and to prepare for a press, media, publications with the real debate, an independent kutatócsoportokat megfizetve, which deríthettek light on the question. 
But, it appears that the Barrick Gold did not trust the public, and one of the authors of a motion for Canada to protect Noir and letters he wrote. 
Mr. Garver megmagyarázhatná perhaps, how to initiate a "public" debate, if at the same time, take it to the public in accordance with the opinion of this? " 
The deputy chairman of the mind of this is likely to be the only such lawyers paid, and not Canada összlakosságát: The concept of the report of the beszűkül so well. 
Even the others in a democratic State becsmérlőket shall also the freedom of speech. 
The Barrick Gold, you do not understand, "or you don't understand it," and that is, that the copyright and kiadóit Noir Canada in support of the public, because the mine eljárásmódját coarse. 
The public is ready to hear the Barrickot and judgment, but this is the basis of civilized arguments, and not one to many more for the trial by elhallgattatásra. (The "public debate" in the context of the words, Barrick Gold recently called the copyright, in writing, to the Noir Canada, to refrain from the use of this term). 
In addition to the Garver szürreális fejtegetésein Barrick Gold of an attack, university research and address the freedom of the search for truth, against which all építőkövei democratic society. 
In the procedure, taking into account the authentic idézéséhez resources, something the facts and their interpretation of the discussion on the right, which form the basis of the intellectual activities. 
If a country like Canada under the burden of judicial procedure may be to study the issues to be discussed and which are not, as such, the industry is rich in today's world, then who will take into consideration the courage to do this? " 
If the Barrick Gold in an open and transparent discussion, it might the scientific standards, according to which the Noir Canada copyright is used. 
It is right to answer. 
The university with us for a long time we are now able to be treated as the debates, differences and conflicts. 
The procedure of Barrick Gold átgondolatlan shows that, contrary to no open debate continued. 
This means the loss of both the universities in the world, and the institution of the place to the Canadian public debate. At the time, that at last the government to introduce such measures, which shall be limited to such visszaélési launched in view of legal proceedings. 
"Agreed to rescue Wall Street, the Democrats and the Republicans 
The Bush-kormány and the republican and the Democratic leaders of Congress yesterday to reach an agreement reached at the end of the marketing mentőakciót, which is of great economic világválság 1930-as évekbeli since the largest cut in such a plan. 
The 700 billion US dollars' worth of the plan, which is aimed at the Wall Street financial crisis since the end of the month to eradicate fury, still must be approved by the Congress of the house of the two. 
The plan of the essential points: The more effective monitoring of the implementation by the representatives; the public monies for the repayment of any new mechanisms to ensure; the new provisions of the payments due to the absence of detained at the level of the number of houses on the holding; the right of the recipient companies received fizetésébe managers. 
Henry Paulson of American Finance Minister, Nancy Pelosi, the chairman of the US Senate, and Judd Gregg, representing the participating in the republican yesterday, a few minutes before midnight, reported the good news came two days after the end of the trial in the stretch. 
"We have a great deal of progress towards a solution, which will effectively functioning of the markets," said Henry Paulson, the Bush-kormány representative. 
"Everything we've done with the aim to save the reálgazdaságot and the American citizens of the Wall Street to the current Crisis'," said the Democratic representatives. 
"The most important aspect is that, if it does not, then there will be a huge shock, the chaos and confusion of the everyday life of the Americans," said Judd Gregg republican representative. 
The trial of the last few hours they fear that another failure would be a harmful effect on the hangulatára investors. 
The agreement of the exchange nyitásáig this morning has been given a deadline for themselves. 
Late in the negotiations, the two candidate for the Presidency she appeared immediately responsive to reach an agreement, however, have not, and, in particular, the situation in the end. 
The Democratic Senator Obama himself down to an extension of the agreement is in the elements, such as, for example, the háztulajdon or by the government for the conservation of the provisions relating to the payment of the companies. 
"When you please the adófizetőktől to take extraordinary steps to felelőtlensége certain other people, in the not too delightful. 
These are the necessary steps but ', "said a US television show. 
And when his opponent, John McCaint another channel it, "he said," megszavazná-e of the proposed plan, he said: "I would like to know the details, but according to my hopes, yes." 
"What I've read in, already visible, for that matter, which shall be emésztenünk for all of us, and that we can move on. 
The possibility that it is not to do anything, it is simply unacceptable, "he said. 
In accordance with the plan of the 700 down the taxpayers money vásárolnák dubious claims by the American financial institutions, exposed, the assets of the bag. 
The plan a 14 months had been preceded by the crisis, which initiated the ingatlanlufi kipukkanása. This is the first time the risky ingatlanhitelek (secondary mortgage összeomlásához) led the way, and then spread to other debt securities (trade) and, finally, the sources of the liquid befagyását felbolydulását and the banks and financial institutions. 
The first of a group of representatives of the republican megállapodás-tervezetet buktatta in the past week. 
It seems that at the end of the cul-de-sac from kikeverednünk had, since the Democrats have agreed that the companies in a difficult situation in certain "toxic" assets to the government but rather than purchase. 
In order to ensure that each member of Congress to be satisfied, it entered a provision of the plan, which requires that, if the government five years shall be borne by the losses in the framework of the programme, it may impose new taxes in order to regain their resources. 
As part of the new plan in a 250 billion dollars for the first time, it shall be paid in instalments; it may be followed by further 100 billion, if the president considers it necessary. 
The remainder of the 350 billion dollars in the Kongresszusnak payment should be approved by the new ballot. 
With the help of the subsidised or Washington, in return for a share of the profits and dividends, and after the crisis lecsengése sell. 
The federal government will have to postpone the plan for the seizure of land and buildings to cover the mortgage. In addition, set by the leaders of the crisis, the companies concerned may be granted to the maximum value of végkielégítés wages and salaries. 
I want to be part of the plan kidolgozói, if the plan megszavazná today was the day the Senate on Wednesday, and the Senate. 
Still, in spite of the efforts, however, are not sure that the plan to be approved. 
For yesterday reiterated statements were opposed to the plan for both the Republicans and the Democrats. 
"It's quite clear that Washington will not hear it in your voice," he said of the republican választóinak Scott Garrett, who is a member of the Financial Committee on the back of the house. 
"Yes, there are serious financial problems. 
"Yes, there are solutions. 
But no, which the adófizetőknek kedvezne. " 
Brad Sherman, "a fraction" of the small Congressional grouping shows the Democrat representing the end of things, but at the same time. 
"Négyszáz excellent marketing experts, including three Nobel-díjas scientist wrote to us, to ask the Kongresszust: Don't be in a hurry, and thoroughly examine which, by the way," Sherman said yesterday. 
At the same moment, in Europe they again, that there is a worldwide crisis. 
After a válságértekezletet three of the Benelux State announced that 11.2 billion euro (16,3 USA-dollár billion államosítja bankcsoport fortis), the value of a part of it. 
In Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg governments intervention after it became necessary, BNP Paribas announced that the French, not by the rival on the edge of bankruptcy after the 2 million euro (2,9 USA-dollárt billion), the US secondary mortgage lost as a result of the crisis. 
Should the twenty thousand fortis 85, the highest of the European bank and one of the ten largest insurance company. 
"This is not one money '," said yesterday, Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos. 
"We will get in exchange for the right to vote and influence in the bank. 
This is exactly the kind of thing that the interests of depositors and highly evaluated the households, now that the situation is uncertain. " 
In the meantime, the La Manche appears to be on the other side of the British Government, a new bank államosítani, which were at the end of the financial crisis. 
In accordance with the English press the government of the Bradford and Bringley átvállalná ensemble in the process of bank loans, in which the ingatlanhitelek 41 billion pounds (75,5 USA-dollárt billion). 
Santander, the Spanish bank, announced yesterday that they would buy in the British bank subsidiaries and ügyfélállományát. 
The Bradford and Bringley that the Northern Rock after it would be the second of a bank, which, since the beginning of the crisis, the British Government államosítani wants. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008 színészbálványtól Farewell. " 
Gyönyörű azure eyes, according to some of the main card, the main weakness in accordance with the others. 
Ever nárciszi Megszabadult-e tükrétől mosolyú great iconic portrait of the American actor? 
"Yes, and no. 
Szégyenlőssége, sensitivity and congenital had also stood by him away from the loud style, which in the course of a real big monstrumainak lételeme. 
But what a great thing to run!!!!! 
At 83, and Paul Newman, died on Friday in Connecticut tüdőrákban. He was one of the last American movie ikonja prosperity. 
It was a monumental KEVÉSBÉ, like Brando, who like and who, over a long period of the rival filmvásznon. Szerepeiben visszafogottabb and, no doubt, was more valuable, but he had the freedom and the dramatic destruction of conventions. 
The vérek keveredéséből exceptional children often originate. 
Newman 1925-ben was born in Ohio and the Hungarian origins, the German Jewish father and mother there. 
The European roots contributed to the shape of the American dream, one of the symbolic megszületéséhez. 
He thought of himself, not too much, that it only increased. 
It was because he had a 'self-made man' eszményképe and the Pacific war ideálja enthusiasts for a broken country. At the beginning of Yale University in drámaszakán, then the New York Actor Studióban 'and learned, before bursting with the theatre, television and not much later, in the world of cinema. 
In addition to the civil rights élharcosa was the second entry in 1979 autóversenyzőként reached 24 hours in the Le Mans-i futamon. However, szexszimbólumként held, although he has lived in since 1958, Joanne Woodward színésznővel happy. 
Now we can never tell what they were drawbacks of this mysterious, reserved, devoted to the work of his life for the actor, who hated the show-business. This remains a mystery for now. 
Sincere, was one of the noblest within the meaning of the word. 
Paul Newman has been stuck at the end of the week of the death of the mozirajongókat: Great szerepeiben only in the memories of black screen to see. 
At the bottom of the seventh Életművét áttekintve végigpereg ahead of American art, the movie starred with continuous change more than fifty years ago. 
Remember the "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid" great iconic portrait of cowboya (1969) and the sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor elhidegülő) young man, whose role in the "cat in the hot bádogtetőn" Tennessee Williams-feldolgozásban we headed back in 1958. 
In the latter times (1990) in the sensitive Mr. Bridge as it will be remembered, who faced with old age, in the hopes that the marriage was not. 
In addition, there were plenty of other face of Paul Newmannek filmjeiben we. 
Robert Wise "someone up there" in the stormy life filmjében bűnöző-bokszoló, Graziano is granted a memorable alakítást. This was originally intended for the James Dean - and received - after the death of his career színészi Newman launched a role in 1956. 
It is also necessary to convict szimpatikus played the "big trouble" alkotásban diamond, which involved in 1973 won the best filmért Oscart. 
Robert Rossen "The svindler" (1961) preliminary filmjében genius, vengeful billiárdjátékost formed, and similar szerepben returned to Martin Scorsese, the colour of the money "filmjében. This latter given in 1987 and received a single Oscar-díját consisting of nine. 
VÁLTOZÓ times, but always the same face: It was he. 
It was always was. 
The period of change in his earlier fémjelezte. 
Especially the younger George Roy Hill "jégtörők" kultuszfilmjéből know (1977), where Reggie Dunlopot, not a jégkorongcsapat edzőjét beyond normal working methods. 
Coen-fivérek has admirers in the subscribed to by "the great leap" in 1994, but could be. 
The line of Sam Mendes' in the path of damnation "was producer in 2003: This was the last of an Irish maffiafőnök. 
Unlike many a mozilegendával, who left the filmvásznat relatively quickly, Newman remained in the spotlight over a long period, although Hollywoodot judged it in order, and képmutatásával fényűzésével together. 
French filmrendező Bertrand Tavernier, without any sense of humor is not considered as "the aluljátszás live cáfolatát": He was too strong to play. 
The industry, however, it was not always the handsome Paul Newmannel, whose only over a long period of the filmszerepek fell into his lap. 
He played less young and successful characters: Rather than live on the edge of society - idegbeteg, an alcoholic, a malicious or hopeless "figures, whose perfect hitelességgel sodródását were vanquished, and he knew he had to give it back. 
Newman Rendezőként showed the face of a less well known: At the bottom of a very shy and sensitive man. 
The 1968-ban orderly "Rachel at, Rachel at" (which Margaret Laurence Canadian movie adaptation of a novel: Handcuffed) with his wife, Joanne Woodwarddal főszerepben the paint a portrait of a woman with a melancholy. 
Of the 1984 "Harry and his son", the sadness and radiant filmmel visszafogottságot kábítószer-túladagolásban and the son of a deceased, Scottnak a memory. 
Yesterday he remembered the Newman admirer of countless színészről. Close friend and old put, Robert Redford (with whom the "big trouble" and the "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid" in sorrow together), playing with it, he said: "The presence of my life for the better, and the rest of the world. 
The existence of generosity and joy: This was the secret of this great actor, rumor, whom we now. 
In addition to the legendary karrierje civil rights, the környezetért, the independent filmgyártásért kicsapongásait struggle with Hollywood and critical comments. 
We could see the image many sauces, sauces, condiments, biscuits and other foods packaging smile. Bad enough must, though still held at the beginning of the funny. 
The revenue from these sales, however, still suffering from the disease has been assigned "set up gyermekekért. 
Newman had never sat on the babérjain: It is committed to the profession. 
Five of his daughter had left a letter written by one of the following phrases: "Your father and was grateful for the szerencsecsillagáért beyond that. 
It was a privilege to me, that I was here. " 
To us, it is that végigkísérhettük such a brilliant and generosity of the American artist's career. 
It was Mintapolgár, above all. 
& Tsai számlagyárában Zuschlag produced what? " 
Soon, October 8, begins the Zuschlag John and his discussion of the current criminal proceedings against him. 
In the case of this and his companions, in particular, causing injury to a criminal organisation, to business and committed fraud and other offences ", inter alia okirat-hamisítással". 
In accordance with the bar is awarded to the tender money has been used for their own account, the performance of the duties and has often false invoices. 
"The government and the financial sector as a whole, about 65 million guilders - part of the Young Baloldal million dollars, of certain persons in the 60s in his pocket. 
The method described by the nyomozóhatóság was the money is awarded to the tender has been taken on the basis of an invoice, behind which was not a fair settlement, and never has the obligation of the associations have not been complied with. 
In accordance with the accounts for a large part of the document was false. 
These józsefvárosi számlatömböket purchased on the market, the körbélyegzőket Kiskunhalason and manufactured. 
And that is the name of the firms that take the számlagyártás, inter alia, balaton-felvidéki leaned on the boulevard, which sent Lados Istvánt Zuschlag John. 
The latter's boarding houses and bed and restaurants in accordance with what he had. 
The fogyasztásairól requested invoices, and the sample of, inter alia, of the Youth and Sportminisztérium, the social and labour wallet, or to be submitted to the Metropolitan Önkormányzat pályázataihoz accounts. 
The majority of these Lados Stephen said his companion Őri Andrással, who, according to the information about most of it is necessary for the purposes of granting aid, reports said. 
Lados "tanulmányútjának" was one of a sörház kiszemeltje. 
Issued by the Zuschlagék in 2003, according to the account done two of the Supervisor vendéglátóhely Pont Association, a group of ninety people of the staff. 
That number, however, the chief clerk, "according to the statement" not squeeze into the vendéglátóhelyre. 
In the same way the better future "later in the Third Évezredért together in a" Foundation in the summer of 2002, the invoice format and content with defects. 
One of only three szobás badacsonytomaji pension because it was, could not be more than ten megaludni one evening in the invoice, yet one hundred and thirty newcomer said. 
But the an imaginative nyomtatvány-kitöltők too, even when the entertainment also marked the Pigal Kft.-t on which the accounts in accordance with the information given in the vádhatóságnak - "it is not included in the name of better hang on the future and on the basis of the documents. 
The leader of the firm, Wolf vanquished hvg.hu-nak told him that when the ügyészségre accounts and have been shown to him, he knew that it was a false documents. 
The "by the stamp in the wrong place and the good name of the adószámunk." 
He added: "In addition to the grounds for the formal was wrong, in accordance with the provisions of the bill that housed a hundred men, for a total of eleven rooms, where there is so much space. 
In addition, the invoice étkeztetésre said, while the éttermük is not a long time ago. 
The ardent számlakészítők in order not to him, nor that they looked out of Budapest travel office only foreign trips, so botorul utaztatást candidates in Hungary and the cash on the service, which the company számlakibocsátási, also did not practice. 
And, as it turned out, during the investigation of the VAT on the document also they were entered, while the European Union countries outside of the operation was to travel from value added. 
Among the VAT rate of the Hotel Révfülöp Inc. but also by the four document issued to a better future, for the company did not provide the 25, but 15 percent VAT, but also the hotel staff, a bill has been issued, the production of the accounts, but, on the other hand, "he said. 
In addition to this, they also take account of the "kiállítók", a firm that, in the case of goods to be carried out on the road and designated as a "clear the ügyészségi by means of the procedure," which was based on the advice of the genuine investment firm does not. 
Also, in addition to the formal számlaformátum differences "is not appropriate, not a real stamp" fell due to the fact that both of the Third Évezredért Foundation, the XXI century Cultural organization and on the point of the Supervisor false accounts. 
As well as the Ravenna Bt. Sporttábor kunfehértói or, in the case of the representatives denied that the accounts they have been issued. 
Not even the counterfeiters, for example, that the nyíregyházi HIB Inc. liquidation was in at the time (2001), when there was a group of Association for the Young, therefore, in accordance with the firm felszámolóbiztosa "we" denied, he claimed that the paper. 
Issued tudatosan who 
In the other group of számlakibocsátók consists of those who were well aware of that fictitious accounts shall be issued. 
The chance of the Young Foundation Baloldal Budapestért "Young, at the request of the socialists, who together account for the Third Évezredért Foundation, it was about 4 million. 
"The Collab Inc. in accordance with the document of the leader of one of the accused, the notional Györfi Ludovic took him to the issue of the invoice. 
Also cooperated in the present liquidation Zuschlagékkal Biogate Kft., in 2003, the better future Foundation, the Atlasz larch Surgeons Surgeons and saw the value of roughly five million guilders invoices, behind which the real economic activity was not. 
Cash flow, because the lesztornózták after the accounts, but that they had already forgotten dokumentumaikban organisations. 
The bill following the issuing of the firms they belong to the group, which shall be the vádlottakhoz. 
So the fuel and gépjármű-kereskedelemmel, based in Budapest, though not in the Delta trió Inc. Ukrainian ügyvezetőjének service agent Kubatov Ivan. 
The company with more than one bill to be issued in October 2005, in November and December computing devices, selling, about 18 million guilders in value. 
The details of the inquiry, according to these accounts since September 2005, 14 in liquidation kiskunhalasi Cash Investment Inc. bought him. 
The firm was the CEO of a Romanian man, who also Kubatov Ivan has forwarded the documents relating to the firm, between 2002 and 2005. 
Yes, we know, during the course of the investigation Kubatov acknowledged that the Inc. on behalf of the invoice issued Atlasznak, the Hoppának the Third Évezredért together, and the Foundation, and he took up the ellenértéküket. 
Specifically Kubatov Ivan was founded at the request of the Romanian masons Fa-Bani Jos hand-fed Kft.-t Bt.-t. Jos-Investment and the 
Actually, however, was not one of the firm, which, in accordance with the accused was due to the fact that they have not received work. 
The undertakings it yet, because vádlott-társa, the papers which also cégalapítások Szente Zsolt lawyer, at the request of the companies on behalf of the Zuschlaghoz accounts related associations: The Atlasznak Y-Generációnak and the. 
The Cash Investment, the Delta trió, the Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and the Linaxtrade Kubatov given to a total of 15 bill on behalf of the organizations, from 14,2 guilders million in value. 
The bar, the amounts shown in the accounts and 10 per cent of the VAT Kubatov hit. " 
The man, even the Szi-Beri Bt.-t also took advantage of the fictitious accounts, they produced the Supervisor Pont proposal. 
The Y-Generáció Alliance and the Modern Magyarországért in January 2006, has submitted a tender to the common organisation of the Socialist party, the Táncsics Michael Foundation (TMA). 
Also obtained a thousand guilders 500-500, but not the amounts indicated in the tender for the purposes of clothing. 
That's not, the Works Team Kft.-től received five fictitious invoices submitted the TMA-nak. 
These accounts have been found, in the educational tárcánál Kemecsei Árpádnak házkutatás held office. 
The bar of a part of the trial, as did the Ügyészségen, is likely to report on the progress of the számlagyártás. 
The most interesting may be, if you are the prime accused, Zuschlag John decides, it seemed the veil. 
It's not too detailed, and although he said several times that exists, it has not yet done so. 
The question, in order to ensure that this is, a large part of the injury, fifty million forintnak concluded, the head of a bargain with the socialists, and Zusi take her. 
Besides, who now even me, because of the failure of mitigating circumstances, that is to say, he was arrested for domestic service applications fell continuously for the deaf. 
While the much larger causing injury, and not in relation to economic crimes elkövetői sétálhatnak freely, or at least to solicit from their own home at the end of the current proceedings against him, there is no possibility. 
The túllicitálás psychology: Why give out more money? " 
The auction of the customers tend to be more money issued túlértékelni of the goods. 
This is known as the "and apparently irrational behavior neurológiai-ökonómiai feltárniuk had" laid the foundations of the New York University (neurológus and researchers. 
It appeared headed to the Science tanulmányuk alulmaradni in accordance with the people they don't want a type of competition, such as eBay árverése and, therefore, the price is too high rather than paying. 
The research of this "game" nervous sémáját mapped to the experimental aukciók. 
In the case of one group of volunteers lottózott, the other group to play a part in the auction, while the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method has been tested for the experimental persons active agyterületeit. 
Both the game nyerhettek money to the participants, but - in which the árverésjáték essential element in the other party túllicitálása - the striatum, named agykéreg complex elvesztésekor intensified during the game. 
This is the agyterület several other function, in addition to the role of the nervous system "önjutalmazó" mechanizmusában. 
According to the researchers, therefore, the price of the striatum felverése can be explained by a violent reaction to it. 
In support of the members of the group (elméletük financial követéses test. 
In this group to put in a bid or two now a partner against three different circumstances. 
The kontrollcsoporttal simply told me that the real value of the product in question, and they have been taken tétjeiket. 
In addition, another group promised that if nyertesen will be out of the game, then even 15 dollárnyi reward money. 
A third group received 15 dollars but just prior to the auction, but in the case of the members of the team losing auction that they had lost the money. 
The difference between the two groups only so much so, that it was the one for the nyerést, the other for the vesztést stressed. 
However, the provisions of the neurológusok hipotézisét "loss," of the troop members of the control and the 'winning' group tétekre higher than they were. 
"These results of any previously existing economy, not because of it. 
They had only for the joy of victory and the kockázatkerüléssel explained in the auction. 
Only the neurological imaging methods to help in the contradiction between these two are so that we now have a third magyarázathoz ', "said Andrew Schotter, a New York University professor of economic fakultásának. 
Hepatitis: Let us when the doctor? " 
About half a billion people in the world that suffer from a chronic infection of hepatitis B or C, Hungary and the driver of the mortality among the reasons the chronic májbetegséget. 
The number of hepatitisfertőzöttek income may be made at home, but only seven, which is due to: The patients often don't know about that. 
The name of the different types of hepatitis viruses májártalmak gyűjtőneve caused by an infection. 
Many of the Tüneteikben, typical of the hepatitis and the jaundice, but kórokozóik caused and the diseases differ from one another. 
Depending on the hepatitisvírusok kórokozótól in the form of two main elements: The hepatitis A and E is the tápcsatornán (for example, through contaminated food, water), the hepatitis B, C, D and the rest of the virus in the blood and testnedvekkel (ondó, vaginal mucus, saliva). 
In any event, the travellers védekezniük pieces of it against the virus A and B, C, there is no vaccine.

Who but God, less pain? " 
According to the results of a fresh research fájdalomcsillapítóként operates as a kind of religious faith, which most of the Catholic martyrs Michael's death, too. 
The Oxford University scientists carried out an interesting experiment, it was examined whether the istenhit fájdalomérzékelését manner in which affect the people, he told the Telegraph. 
The rather bizarre elektrosokkban within the framework of the investigation would be allowed 12 Catholic worshipers and the same ateistát, while they studied a painting of the Virgin Mary. 
According to the results of the Catholic believers were able to exclude a large part of the pain. 
As a result of the human brain scanner threw the technique, it was found that the Roman Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain, which is responsible for regulating the pain. 
The study is the first of a series of research, in addition to the academicians, the scientists, philosophers, theologians and participate in a different part of the University. 
The study turned out exactly as a means of sparkling in the subject's left hand, which supplied the elektrosokkot. 
In the experiment, the researchers asked customers to look strong, two of the painting, the Sassoferrato painted in the 17th century by the Virgin Mary and Leonardo da Vinci painted the 15th century hermelinnel Lady in the picture. 
Makers of the investigation, hoped that the Virgin Mary in a sort of religious believers in the state, while the da Vinci image was chosen because it is, because we are not too different from the other and soothing effect. 
The test subjects had spent half an hour in an MRI's, during this time of 20 elektrosokkot received four consecutive partly, or the religious affairs or the general picture. 
Catholics are advised that the Virgin Mary in the sight of the "safe" themselves, like who "have been" and "lenyugodtak, filled them peace." 
Beneath the image of the religious affairs during the 12 per cent reported less pain, as when Leonardo of themselves in front of him. 
Miguel Farias psychologist, who also took part in the investigation, do you think that any strong effect with a similar effect may be achieved, the ateistáknál, only to be found in the appropriate photo had been. 
"We should be in a picture, who feel very positive, as a mother or father. '," said the psychologist. 
Tom flyers Anglican Bishop welcomed the results of the research. 
"The exercise of the faith ought to be, and in many cases, and the circumstances change." The flyers, "he added. 
It was only after the results of the fine, the question is, if that Leonardo, or, in the case of a similar calibre of one of the painter Madam show a picture of it, how would have an impact on the fájdalomszabályozásukra? 
The sight of the quality of the Virgin Mary would be even better results? " 
In the case of, or what share yourself 
Tenth birthday, you may tell the Google: The men are described in detail in at least as much in his pocket, as the above their heads in the sky; he knows where vakációztak, szakrendelésekre what they are and what they are interested in. 
But this is still not enough Eric Schmidt, the firm, according to one of the main man. 
That, however, the orwelli rémképpel szkeptikusokat entering this, to the point that they did not see the essence of the web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt, the Financial for it, "she said recently, Google that the main purpose of the more personal information to collect felhasználóikról together, and this is necessary to ensure that they keep the Google-alapítók original objective, which said:" We have all the information system in the world!!!!! ". 
The megszólaltatott Google-vezér világfelforgató ten years, according to the firm, even after work only at the beginning of the run, in particular, that all of the information they are treated. 
The question is, what will become of that five years later, Schmidt said: "If the Google could answer such questions as," what do you expect me to do tomorrow? "Or" how it would be to me really work? ", however, did not know until the software to answer the questions to be so simple, because they could not meet the users. 
Not all internetező is aware that the internet searches in the keresőszavak are fixed, and that the IP-címről after what they search for on the side of the people. 
Two years ago, the Search beindított Personalized eltárolhatják, for example, by means of the users of its own szörfölési háttértörténetüket, visszanézhetik, what, what about, and in the long term by a more personalised találatokat generate the same logikán based on them, and then the Recommendations, which in the case of the products and services we offer the previously told the system on the basis of the preferenciáink and fixed. 
What if the adataimat used against me, if I see what I've been doing? "Ask the users, who are worried the Google adat-monopóliumát. 
For the most part, rather than the firm represented by the scale of the potential power may be alarming, not the guilt, the fear of him, the szabadságvágy, is the power of the rebellion against the ellenreakciókat internetezőkben. 
It's a fact confirmed, however, that the expression of all was not fixed, but they are, where appropriate, to be sold through a third party, such laws in the cases internetezők nothing protects the privacy rights. 
This is perhaps the loudest example of the last time the Brazilian pedofilok concerted action against it, which in the course of the Brazilian government handed it to Google maintained by the Community on the other side of the pedofilokkal called Orkut, allowing the identification information. 
But the privacy rights of anxious internetezők felsóhajthattak even in May, when the firm Eff electronic laws of the body representing operators which process successfully proved in court against the truth to the FBI, according to the Google the future of the Constitution neither he nor any of the fact that the FBI requested by any information which might secretly. 
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought out of about 50,000 webcímet and a thousand keresőkifejezést, which the years adopted previously obtained by reference to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, but yet they managed to obtain the individual users search, lists of a month or two, and brought the total weboldal- kulcsszó-listát). 
It is a very controversial and therefore the Google: Know those who kept their personal data in the grant because they feel, intimate and magánéletük szférájuk soundness, Google that the start and used for the services of the Conservative imidzsben brilliant multicégeknek due to take that up with them. 
In the meantime, the American geek-kultúra and appearing in a number of countries, saying the computer, aktivistákat, comprising vadhajtása nagycégek users to the next generation, "a korporáció" to see them, as opposed to riválisával, due to the Windows világmeghódítóként Microsofttal recorded, in spite of his fight both for the same purpose. 
This may be because of the different Microsofttól in such a way as to the Google does not obtained from the identification code does not alkalmazásaiért money, the open, free, continuously kept fresh and programcsomag forráskód much elérhetőbbnek, fiatalosabbnak, six in one of the official szoftveróriás coolabbnak gyakorlatánál. 
However, it may be due to the fact that the geekek átlátják exactly the privacy rights of Internet and the very problematic relationship, which is one of the most kulcsszava smidgen of recent years, the web 2.0, after you. 
The web 2.0 is not something else, like the kollaborációról, to ensure that we ourselves intentionally tracks available, and after the channels of communication thereof individually and the extent of these changes, the point is the same: We ourselves. 
An average of the young people in the Community may lead to more on the side of the profile of the Facebooktól Xangáig, together, they are also subject to other services, such as the Twitterrel or, in the case of musical habits listázó last.fm-mel, and all these things so követőrendszerekbe bekötheti, like the FriendFeed Blip.fm or, in addition to blogot, which appear in the latest fényképgalériáik automatically, which the Flickr-en Picasán or stored. 
While a number of best olvashatunk case, in which the kiviláglik: The friends easily out of the common friendship circle fényképáradatát breakfast, seeing that fraudulent friend with whom he had spent the evening of a company or kirúghatja dolgozóját only because the real opinion blogjában describes the upper vezetésről: A sure, the idea of privacy completely átértékelődött now. 
Who's online life, consists of a show that, on the day of this fogalmazhatjuk alaptételt hidden behind the behaviour of young people. 
And who has something to hide, or, at least, it wants to avoid the Google-monopóliumot, for example, may take the (from using the Google keresőrendszerét, but at the same time, not deliberately leaving all-items Scroogle-lal). 
Not a few, for example, the number of people who are not deliberately Community oldalakra, that may not be one of them, the Google in the online uses the képkezelőig szövegszerkesztőtől hírolvasóig and may be replaced by alternative verziókkal, which are not huge szerverparkokhoz and which we shall not be compared to the best profile had existed. 
It is not so much a secret to the public, when the Google shows his teeth of the protein. 
The current 156 billion dollars of the value of the company was worth more than the IBM (140 million dollars), the Intel (124 million dollars) or the Coca-Cola (110 million dollars), the AdWords / AdSense-hirdetési reklámügynökségek surfaces of the threatened, introduced by the accelerating pace of services and cause serious Microsoftnak not only the right, but a number of other szoftverfejlesztőnek. 
In the case of the critical, however, is on the side of these disquieting ellenpontokat: The upper management, for example, is rejected by the employees had, after duplájára raised the fee for school supplies, rather too much of the management of the staff of the daily optionally sokszori étkeztetését, however, degraded and the fact that the Google still bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and before the commencement of each hit kiszűr within the meaning of the firm, which is, for the good of the tastes and interests of the Chinese regime. 
One of the company's internal rule seems to not published in advance of the new service, only when it can be used, but, to be sure, in the coming months and years mozgathatják another point for the foreseeable future problems in the world: While some consider the Google project and magazinszkennelési -archiválási and a dimension, the firm that the Supreme Court of the United States soon to be in the face, others fear the Health (3), the fact that the total health profile to build up the previous leleteinkkel ourselves, and problémáinkkal orvosainkkal. 
And the fact that the Google genetic database builds up the science fiction comedy writers of the next generation may be a good material, the popular Cory Doctorow story, to the point of Scroogled orwelli intensely describes the future, in which a man only the Google formidably well from it.

What would be the best way to avoid the impact of technologies for the development of, if not the world akadályérzékelők in imitation of nature? 
For example, the méheké. " 
In Japan for the astonishing CEATEC-en presented in the buzzing bees, the project has been given the strategic value of the Nissan engineers thought to how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems. 
In cooperation with the post but the Nissan built the BR23C type, bioutánzatú autórobot-irányító system, a robotizált miniautót, which features the bees of disrespect, with the ultimate aim to assist the development of such a scheme, which will eliminate all the conflict. 
During the flight, all of the uterus shall establish the oval of personal space, which is similar to the safety of what, really, "he said," the exhibition védőburkunkhoz Kazuhhiro Doi, public relations and technology R & D márkaigazgató. 
It is important that the role of the bee compound, in every direction, which is more than 300 degrees látószögben can see. 
It is a function of the engineers lemásolásához compound, in view of the man with the lasgun telemetry idea. 
This is the BR23C 180 degrees from in front of the same 2 m within the term to identify the barriers, calculate the távolságukat, and send a signal to the on-board mikroprocesszornak, which shall be műveletté to avoid the collision. 
The fraction of the obstacle detection, then the autórobot imitation of movements of the bee, the wheels of change the direction of twisting, to the extent necessary to avoid the collision. 
The current system BÁRMELY in a different manner, this is an avoidance manoeuvre impulse is to take place in such a way as to be completely. 
"If this is not so, the autó-robot would not be able to respond quickly enough to avoid the barriers," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the Mobility Laboratory autó-robot and the leader of the project. 
In such a way as to respond immediately and shall be instinctive, whereas this technology to shield the security of the most vulnerable and the inner layers, a layer in, which shall be deemed to be within the conflict is inevitable. 
It should reflect the whole process, which makes a bee, in order to get out of that other bees. 
This process shall be in a twinkling on roads outside built-up areas. 
But, the bees in a different manner, the derogation does not concentrate upwards or downwards diagonal, only a two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the wheels elfordíthatóságának. 
The bees in such a way as to the rest of the bee level when entering available only instead of infinite possibility here in the movement and accelerating, as well as the decelerations autórobot has been available to the resort. 
The BR23C lítium-polimer batteries, which is easier and more energiasűrűségük, which means that the longer life than the lítium-ion változaté. 
Andoh is an intelligent, in accordance with the instinctive reaction, it is important not to the processing of data, still less ability to store. 
This is only a few seconds of the device input signal must be processed and respond to them.

He finished the written version of the applicable in several instalments, the banks of bad loans to buy up to 700 billion dollars of economic mentőcsomag-törvénynek. 
Circle in the first half of the amount spent. 
At the time, on the east coast, according to the Saturday midnight to further negotiations in Congress during the time of the leaders of the 700 billion dollars for a total of about mentőcsomag, for many days since the debate, "he told Reuters. 
We have a serious progress, "said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic chairman of the US Senate, who was only in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement is sowing paper. 
The package was born in both the compromise candidate for the Presidency, peaches Obama and John McCain, too. 
Henry Paulson Minister of the outcome of the compromise, said: "The programme will be effective and will work, but any further treatment is necessary." Pelosi, according to the Wall Street megmentéséről this not say, but the economy - megfordításáról. 
In a written version of the package, the Asian markets in Washington on Sunday evening in time for the opening of the 8 (i.e. central European time) on Monday, according to two o'clock in the morning before it was published, but it was not caused by the spectacular felfutást börzéken. 
Acting in the programme, the end of the marketing year vészstabilizálási Act of 2008, the name of the law student draft legislation in the Senate, the vote for the first time on Monday, and then the Szenátuson will be at the front of the line. 
George W. President Bush Pelosival he spoke on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of understanding arrived. 
"We are pleased with the progress achieved in the night, and we appreciate the efforts of two of the couple to stabilise pénzpiacainkat and protect our," said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman. 
The programme, differs from the view of the original javaslatától, which said that the 700 billion dollars has been spent also would have been a bad quality, hitelhátterű purchases of securities. 
Now, for the first time in more than half of the 700 down to the amount you can spend in such a way that use of 250 milliárdot immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the matter on Monday, the Ministry of Finance credit background, with the classification of the securities it buys, with further 100 billion dollars, and the president will depend on the fate of the subject. 
The programme shall be the subject of a separate body, the chairman of the Federal Reserve is involved. 
On the other half of the 700 billion would be spent in the adoption of the new Congress. 
The Ministry of Finance, within the meaning of the law may be combined tactics: To buy bad loans and securities jelzálogokat jelzáloghátterű, or any other type of "toxic" loans. 
In the framework of the purchase of aukciók directly and may be communicated to the ministry compares its ". 
The law allows for the firms concerned, to participate in an insurance scheme, where the financial wallet to guarantee the means of concern, because of the damage it is expected to be paid a fee corresponding to the companies. 
Henry Paulson told me: The law will give the necessary tools to 700 billion dollars to remember the urgent needs of the American financial system, or the purchase of a wide range of assets, like biztosításukról, like a large financial institution shall be due to systemic risk inherent összeomlásával elkerüléséről. 
Megtesszük is taking the necessary steps to be ready to stand up to the implementation of the law, as soon as they are signed, "he added. 
The government has been in trouble and talents to help banks may, however, that the association of the overseas money - which lelépési szleng simply gold ejtőernyőnek calls "to the government. 
Only the payments to be made in certain cases, moreover, the constraints on how to provide assistance to the Ministry of Finance. 
The restriction is essentially means that, if the framework of the auction from the ministry, többletadót ejtőernyőre imposed on the gold, unless the unsuccessful bankvezért retirement. 
The bad loans are agresszíven direct purchase of the government, and to ensure that they are, the drivers are not eltúlzottak coins. 
The picture is added to the existing ejtőernyő-szerződések gold does not change, the restrictions only apply to the new, so that to encourage participation in the programme. 
This is the first time in American history, that there will be any restrictions on the approximation of the laws in force as regards the vezérigazgatók remuneration, "said the measure in the Senate, the chairman of the Committee shall be responsible for the financial services, the Democratic party should Barney Frank. 
In addition, in banks participating in the programme, the government has the right to részesedésszerzésre, thus reducing the risk to taxpayers, because in the end, be the ügyleten, as soon as the economy, together with the bank, and he rose to his feet. 
The Bill, the President, in the next five years will be on a proposal to be submitted to the Kongresszusnak, which provides, as may be returned to the taxpayers of the anticipated losses in the financial sector. 
Both sides also, of course, there were some who expressed their inquiries in relation to the plan. 
This is not what the American citizens for us, that is to say, not to protect the taxpayers, "said the California dollárjait republican representative Darrell Issa.

Of the German language area lapszemléje 
The right-wing camp, only within the camp of the electorate öntudatosabbá - and so will analyse the weak on the CSU der Spiegel Bavaria. 
Austria kormányázására Haiderék ready, to prevent the black and red koalíciót. 
Der Spiegel spiegel.de (). 
On the left-hand side of the Internet edition of German hírmagazin Franz Walter, Bavaria szülőatyáit eat the Revolution, will carry out an analysis of the causes of the CSU dramatic defeat. 
The erosion of the CSU in accordance with the political scientist known long before, that would have been the sad Beckstein-Huber duet took office. 
Through the decades the keresztényszocialisták Bajorországot renewed, and now they are just the modern citizens turn away from them. 
At the same time, the whole of the korszakváltás kereszténydemokrácia, Angela MERKEL problem, too. 
It was not a failure for the CSU quite surprising, but on Sunday to put an end to a process, which was likely to be almost exactly ten years ago: He ceased to be a állampárt hegemóniája indisputable. 
MÁR ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU 47,7 percentage, for the first time since the fifties years below the level of 50%. 
It was three years ago, one of the Bundestag 2005 elections, so even the Stoiber in age. 
This is due to the CSU has consistently carried out by the range of modernization, which eat the parents. 
Now, 40 years ago this szociológusok jövendölik, but the pace he deceived. However, it was not without consequences of the electorate the loyalty of the CSU szekularizáció, the educational results, the eastern and észak-németek betelepülése Bavaria in developing regions. 
With the modernization of the increase in opportunities, and the political consequences of this is clearly visible. 
The right-wing camp intact, only the camp became within the electorate öntudatosabbá, kritikusabbá, önfejűbbekké. 
It is also striking that, in the last weeks of the classical civil groups, most of which come in the CSU-tól; free foglalkozásúak, the érettségizettek végzettségűek and the university. 
Here was the subject of a shrinking of 40 per cent of the CSU támogatottsága.

As it was, in any case, the course of the fledgling congress Schüssel-Molterer. 
This is not to repeat the direction of the. 
Molterer has reacted cautiously to the red offers. 
As he said, then surely you will not be effective cooperation if the intervention of the ÖVP Faymann attempt to interfere with the. 
That party or the Opposition, or enters the koalícióba, the as yet completely open to the faction of the issues to be discussed within the ÖVP necessarily. 
Jörg Haider BZÖ President again open in every direction. 
"To prevent the black and red koalíciót, we are ready to assume responsibility of the government," Haider it.

CSU: For a transitional period of grace 
At the end of October to decide the fate of the duet leszerepelt Huber-Beckstein 
Gone, in spite of the failure of the choice of heads were not yet, the Bavarian CSU elnapolták peaks for the personal questions. 
Erwin Huber pártelnök Günther Beckstein provincial kormányfő and still remain in place, the issue is, how long will the grace. 
The 17 percentage of catastrophic voksveszteséget - herringbone been subject to the extraordinary pártkongresszus hétvégéjén last October's fate will be decided. 
Nevertheless, even of the members of the much bírált érzékeltették: Not all the székükhöz effort. 
The fraction with the base, and tried to soothe angry members, who one day "the Bavarian was" after personal STRETCHES due to the loss of the absolute majority required. 
Five years ago, it is true, even the trajectory of the Edmund Stoiber vezérletével "in the tops of the Christian Social Union 60,7%), and now, a year after the Stoiber puccs to 43,4% they could afford. 
The CSU 46 years was "absolute monarch who was absolute" of the German tax of 18% of GDP in Bavaria. 
Even though the conservatives will continue to be the key to the Hungarian economy, high in the southern part of the range, who koalícióra in the future. 
One of the first discussed within the párton Huber, a sign of the potential successor Horst Seehofer Vice-President and federal agrárminiszter is also a place in the narrow felderítőcsapatban, in which the liberal FDP-vel, or along the right values szerveződő Free Választókkal puhatolózó negotiations with a view to a possible Munich koalícióról government. 
The strange fate, and that of the electorate in the list of the Gabriele Pauli törvényhozásba, whose Stoiber Huber-Beckstein puccslehetőségként action against the pair took advantage of it, and they have driven the ambitious municipal politikusnővel. 
The CSU driving now all their energies to be devoted to stabilise Becksteint. 
He would get into the active role in the Stoiber szövögető against the background of the fibres, the former provincial kormányfő and political career of the former CSU-elnök 28.-át. September called the bitterest 
Huber bilious comments on Monday when a few of the CDU, he would have been a much more of an aid testvérpárttól. 
MÁS CSU-s defeat the politicians have interpreted it in such a way that the warning to the CDU-nak Merkelnek and Angela. 
After due in September 2009 the Bundestag-választást MERKEL may not be Chancellor, if the 2005 national success CSU-t playing a major role in the light of the joint force shall not be somehow rose to his feet. 
To the disappointment of the bright fiaskó MERKEL in accordance with the CSU talajvesztése will not have the effect of the fall of the Berlin nagykoalícióra kihatni. 
Which, of course, the relative: The wounded CSU-t will not be easier to deal with the crisis and szociáldemokraták továbbtart. 
The SPD 18,6% since 1946, the result of the weakest of Bavaria. 
Lukasenko-ellenzék: 110-0 
Not a single opposition representative in the parliament in the elections in Belarus on Sunday. 
In accordance with the Russian observers that the result was led by Alexander Lukasenko insured and stability in the country, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (EBESZ), however, can be explained by the szavazatszámláláskor törvénytelenségekkel committed. 
Of the 43 countries sending EBESZ 450 observer did not recognize the election. 
Although the legislation of the country of millions of 10 people in a decade of a hundred and ten or the Opposition nélkülözi, yesterday before the elections in the United States of Democratic Forces (ODSZ) made it known as the opposition had hoped that the alkotmánymódosítás in response to the 2006, the purity of the presidential elections for the fourth time this mandate renewed Lukasenko "allows" representing some of the opposition in the parliament. 
The considered the ODSZ bojkottól in advance. 
The opposition is in the background, that the volumes of Belarus - more and more economically dependent on the Russian földgázimport dráguló continuously reduce loan taken up, and contributed to the country of transit gázvezetékeket Beltranszgaz holds the trophy to the Russian, "he was to improve relations with the EU, where the antidemokratikusnak Lukasenko due to political conditions for the production of certified in Belarus, and several high-ranking politician is not an entry permit. 
Enyhülésre in advance, EBESZ that the assessment of the election campaign, rather than the positive elmozdulásokra, and not the deficiencies, for example, the opposition candidates in the jet was spewed eltiltására third placed the emphasis on ". 
On Monday, however, the EBESZ gyorsjelentése also objected to the campaign - during which the opposition candidates substantially jelenhettek and the press - and, in particular, that the opposition could not be present for the ballot papers bearing the votes cast. 
This, together with the opposition but noticeable improvement in accordance with the political system: The release of political prisoners, and less konfrontációra Minsk to Moscow, refusing to continue the Grúziától elszakadó Dél-Oszétia Abházia and recognition, although the Russia - which constitutes a federal State Belarus on paper - a month as the two independent area. 
"We have two steps forward and one back, but the most important, that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU," said the Daily Prophet Alexander Milinkevics. 
According to the 2006 elnökválasztás opposition candidate, it is desirable that it remains, despite the fact that "power, he was afraid that the parliament or even a weightless ellenzékit beengedjen." 
The opposition is not protest actions at the sight of the results, rather than the message of economic reforms on the need to try to reach the választókhoz. 
"This, of course, there are many unknowns, the opposition shall be nyomtatnunk pages in Russia, the dissemination gördítenek obstacles to the local authorities, but it seems to me that more and more people to support the change among the elderly," said Milinkevics, with reference to the fact that Lukasenko rezsimjét, which is the main results as the creation of social security, even in the most layer of officially supported pensioners, it is not appropriate. 
- The country eladósodása, the trade deficit is a matter of time because of the increase in the cemetery, their ugly "Milinkevics megbomlása social security," he said. 
The handshake the opposition against the Russian observers demokratikusnak certified the election. 
The Commonwealth of Independent States misszióját Sergey Lebegyev leading to the Russian hírügynökségnek Novosztyi Ria said: "It's not the words, but they believe he testified to the people," and the lack of opposition by none other than the proof of the maturity of the electorate in Belarus.

Accidents at work: The more important than anything else in accordance with the principles that preventive action Napolitano

"The Anmil communicated by the troubling data, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, it is supported by the fact that, in the work of the Prevention baleseteknél very important role," said Pietro Mercandellihez president Giorgio Napolitano, the president of the National Association of Accidents at Work message to disabled people. 
Államfő looking for the truth, "the association's commitment to the hard work of prevention, the accident érdekvédelme workers, assistance to the families of the victims and the general public to be interested in you." 
"And frankly TERMÉSZETES are divided by the indignation of such méreteiknél, the media and the public interest also tragédiák continues, but the reality is more than a dramatic day at the end of the day, again and again, to be confronting megismétlődő cases." 
Napolitano openly admit it: "We have no doubt forráshiánnyal, education and information is crucial to the financing. 
They give important initiatives within the school, which was on the brink of its entry into the world of work of direct increase will be targeted at young people. 
Kötelességünk maintained in the interest of the phenomenon, not allowed to lankadjon attention to the social importance of the question, as well as the need for more effective legislation, which shall be enforced. 
The House of the President of the Council of the Gianfranco fini stressed, "ending in the death of accidents at work, how serious, all social significance on his conscience, and the institutions shall be required to put an end to this as soon as possible."

Of the MP3 players as cause 
The cause permanent as a portable pick-up devices for a longer period of time and high hangerőn silence, as is the case with MP3 devices. " 
Done at Brussels, "he said in the report published by the European Commission, the EU's new and newly identified health risks (SCENIHR) by the Scientific Committee on the day on grounds of public opinion. 
"The szakvéleményből, shows that the percentage to be permanent as those who, for a period of five years for more than an hour per day, with a high hangerővel listening to portable zenelejátszójukat" in the explanation. 
"It is worrying that the young people who were in high hangerőn and often used in portable zenelejátszókat mobiltelefonokat and are not aware that could assist visszafordíthatatlanul '," said Meglena Kuneva. 
"The scientific surveys indicate a risk to indisputable, which shall be reagálnunk as a matter of urgency," added the Union, to be sure. 
The most important task of informing the consumer and the widespread dissemination of information relating to this. 
To be reviewed in the light of the report referred to in the experiment of the existing control systems that they operate effectively and to keep pace with the latest technologies. " 
Brussels has asked the independent scientific committee, that the transportable zenelejátszók incidence, as well as the noise caused by an increase in the number of young people who have been exposed to, having regard to examine the problem. 
"The researchers confirmed that there's reason to worry. And the European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and the interested parties, ready to examine what, if any, of the measures could be introduced on the portable players and similar devices are exposed to noise generated by, in order to protect children and young people," he said finally, a member of the Committee. 
The European safety requirement currently in force 100 dB to determine the maximum sound level by portable zenelejátszók may, however, be accompanied by increasing anxiety in the light of such SOUND SOURCES excessive arising out of the use of the data relating to the hearing damage.

This is a portable device is about 5 to 10 percent of the users, which the EU 2,5-10 million inhabitants might mean.

There is no word of any conflict of competence, but we have a platform, in Rome, where, for the benefit of the great születhetnek plans. 
In March, after having carried out the work of the Committee, feloszlik, for a limited period of time and on the basis of the mandate. 
June benyújtjuk "only in Rome, the future," based on the work of the committee as a strategic plan, "said the Lord Mayor. 
Those who, as the functioning of the Commission on the grounds that set up the advice is not binding, Alemanno answers: "It all depends on how the work carried out by the Commission, and that the level of proposals on the table. 
If the standard proves to be considered, as well as in France, the Attali or, in the case of the Commission, which I was sure I, also in the case of Rome, the contribution of the important role of will. 
The strength of the policy often becomes specialized in the daily affairs for some months, as well as the management of urgent cases arising from time to time. 
In contrast, taking into account the criteria further perspective, and in the longer term is elkötelezetten and Rome, and in order to ensure the development of future work. " 
The Mayor of Rome, to clear off, "that the Commission shall not be deemed to be useless" vízfejnek ', because it is free, the Roman citizens to avoid a eurójába will not, by contrast, is gondolatösztönzésül elméinek's involvement in the capital, and is aimed at ".

Obama? "The first Amerika-ellenes President. We'll show why. 
A known, independent of that of the American politician, he wrote: "It will be the second Amerika-ellenes down Obama president. 
The first of the Jimmy Carter, who was ruined by the decisions of the American economy, and close links with the private (as they are even now) with Islam-a traverse of the enemy. " 
As the date for the elections, so sűrűsödnek the attacks against Obama. 
He wrote that a Miami lady on the Internet: "This is the man is full of ambíciókkal. 
Obama arcátlan módon believes that make a nation one of the highest public dignity, which is so far this to a total of two of the five United States and black!!!!! " 
These attacks of the plain fact; of course, racist nature, but did not give an answer to the question of the voters, that would be a good President. And then there are whom opinion polls showed to be: Indicate that Obama will win, and with a significant. 
In this case, it is, and it is not the affections of his brain. 
The interior of the southern states, a mississippi vezércikkében newspaper wrote: We know that the szavazókabinban the real American patriot who give to the vote. 
In a side of the American explainable here, which remained under wraps until the last moment. 
"I can only speak, what do you want, and we know where on the ikszet, or McCain-re Obamára." 
There are those who swear by it: If Obama wins, leaving the United States. 
Never were such words, until recently, when the success of a black candidate was almost certain to be taken. 
At the same time, in spite of all the Democrats winning okoskodások weapons of George Bush himself. 
About 500 people were asked what they were committed errors during Bush's term of office? 89 per cent said that Iraq. 
In America. 
This is one of the nation's 50 000 soldiers lost in Vietnam, and the prison, that flew home. 
4 500 soldiers to lose his life in Iraq, and the Americans did not have them. 
But it seems the majority that Iraq was Bush's weak point. 
ÓRIÁSI task ahead, George W. who enter the place. 
USA: The economic disaster of the journalists feel, the szerkesztőségekben came to the time constraints. Many of the Internet okolják, the printed press "death". 
The Pew research institute five hundred American reporter asked, how to think about the future of their situation and intellectual power. 
"Well, now almost every reporter pessimistic for the future. 
It was not clear, however, that the aggodalmuk would have decreased in respect of its authenticity. 
I do not feel so isolated themselves, than previously. 
The American journalists the problem of the money. 
They claimed that the 2008 crisis, a weak economic model of the bankruptcy. 
The newsroomra TOVÁBBI pose a serious problem, that is to say, the maker of paper szerkesztőségekre measured constraints. 
If you don't want that, in addition to the traditional journalism if, in the sense that the public at large he during this period, to minimize zsugorodjon, it must be solved the problem - say the addresses of the journalists. 
Nowadays, in a clearly visible and compound pessimism of the American újságírást. 
The printed press working journalists and sixty per cent of the top leaders is convinced that the national zsurnalisztika rossz úton jár. 
Journalists at the local level, 65 per cent of the top of the driving position. 
It shall have a printed v. electronic media. 
The staff of the press does not cause difficulties, to see where the Web. 
The largest publishers themselves to break out of the way of the Internet, many of which are in such a way that the printed press "murderer". 
Perceived by the journalists' economic pressure "means increased from 79%. 
The reporter interviewed 500 acknowledged that the technology will be down beside each, in the hope that perhaps the zsurnalisztika benefit. 
Today, the American sajtószakmában szerkesztőségi dropoff in the leaders, that is to say, the directors, and the reporters who between them. 
At the national level, the leaders of the 56 per cent sure that tudósítóik also shared information with others, while on a local level is the ratio may be made only 23%. 
Some of the jobs to be associated with this. 
At the national level, the leaders of the 47 per cent of fears that he might be out within three years of employment. 
In the case of the journalists that the rate of 30 per cent. 
In America a "safe line of work" csapatszinten szerkesztőink (the question of what, in the case of the stands.) is on the agenda. 
- the only 13 per cent of the Treaty provides. 
In the case of a great nation, with more than 300 million in the United States of America, where thousands of newspapers, radio, television and Internet-szolgáltató, employers generally offered as much as they want, so the thing "to be or not to be" on the basis of the work. 
The general managers, the high salary, the editors and may also tens of thousands of dollars a month, the pension and health insurance fee in addition to fizetésén. 
But the principle of the freedom of a pretty complicated: The first year, and at the end of the day, in the third, until after a certain period of time is less than the maximum 15 days. 
But the American journalists, by his own account, often during the course of the year "of any." 
All of the climate.

Ügyvédei, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, requested that the ingatlan-szakember átjárhasson kisvárosból flat in the provincial capital. 
According to the court, however, these ingázások (for which the prosecutor's rejection of a proposal to allow) that the company will affect the affairs of and access to the evidence against him. 
The basic seed veszélyben 
The phenomenon was already a few days ago, when the Senate not szavazta submitted by the White House and the 700 billion dollar mentőcsomagot: Americans are more interested in a substantial part of it, and you still, the Wall Street, yea, save as the economy. 
This is supported by the New York Times yesterday, which is informed that, due to the current crisis, to withstand the republican párton within megosztottságot more than the traditional, moderate, the federal institutions and business circles in support of the eastern coastal attitude and the growing medium and southern states, and financial világ-ellenes Washington- a new line. 
This is the line was critical of the way the képviselőházi referred to in the introductory words during the vote. 
In that event, however, the only one of the major changes, which was still in or láttatni indicates economic discussed in advance, and not only in the United States of America, but the whole of the Western world, and perhaps beyond. 
It seems that the crisis in the USA and Europe, but it was a good time to accelerate the latent phenomena, which are evaporated in the new atmosphere, and are to be revealed. 
The first such újraaktualizálás the phenomenon of the double visszahozása category of the sovereignty of the state, the economy was in a kind of újraállamosításával. 
The crisis for the banki-pénzügyi institutions, which maintain close contact with the rest of the world, and in particular, and fairly widely, so they brought people and families, which is one of the country, one of the State of Israel. 
But this is a direct political difficulties for those on the wheel: What are encouraged to respond to the needs of the people and tiltakozásaira, who, by the electorate. 
Therefore, the crisis világméretűnek what appears to be economic sense, but almost exclusively on a national political sense. 
It seems that the political internacionalizmus outside Italy in a hoarse: And this is evidence of the European Union, which the various interests and different national strategies lavírozva between would not be able to designate a single political line. 
And then everybody is waiting for you in the national government of the intervention, the mentőcsomagot, and boost to the new rules, but most of the opening of the funds: Because of the situation in each of the Member States have economic resources, financial stock, which may be able to do the right things. 
Megvannak and empower the means to use these: In the case of the conditions of the two in a priceless resource, which is likely to be the subject of any other market, an international organisation, and never will be no such provision should be made for. 
Moreover, the nemzetállamiságra by the crisis, which is in full compliance with the new emphasis is put on the fact that, in the latter days of economic growth in a factor to consider increasing importance, which is closely related to the elements: And this is the területiség. 
A paradox, while we were convinced that we had the network, the more sophisticated technology to the world of abstract, and we were convinced that the global financial world to warn that dominated the world once, but we had noticed that more and more of the future, not just an abstract depends on the good things, like the water, and the production of crude oil. 
Such things, though it may be transported in which one half of the planet to the other, yet in full within a fixed, may be one of the area. 
So then, who dominated the area, much more ütőkártyával has, unfortunately, who was born to a place where there is no crop of crude oil, and there is no water. 
This is the second újdonságra through the business, which is a kind of working with the cells. 
Who states that area, state government, the necessarily says: Policy, in other words, management. 
From the point of view of the EBBŐL, it appears that the economic crisis, one of two összecsengő throws phenomenon: 
In order to recognize the objective, on the one hand, that there is a need for credible driving, olyasvalakikre, who can handle the sequence of events. 
On the other hand, the current management másrészről and, in particular, of the total hitelvesztését economic leaders, who proved to be totally unfit and have demonstrated that many of them, even in the area. 
The two together with even deeper significance, and in some ways more: The hitelvesztés, impatience, defect and sense of himself, which was more to the west of the country, the total amount of driving elitet. 
It seems, therefore, that more and more of the population covered by the conviction that the summit in the social elite has expired. Has expired, even before, experience, életmódjukat, know their culture, the complex within the meaning of the word, madrassas. The social elite elidegenedik grew more and more of the opinion of the majority. 
The demand for driving egyszóval, wrapped in the form of a wide, but the strong delegitimációs movement towards the ruling class and the traditional political system. This is not waiting for the voters' lázongásaiban ", or, in the case of the latter days of a sudden changes in the climate. The conservatives such as power appears in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of munkáspárti unit in Great Britain or the US Congressional representatives of rebellion against the Bush (and perhaps also of the Italian M. de Villele for victory here). 
It seems that the traditional elite, pártjaival, programmes and, also, that his habits, and illustrious értelmiségével sajtójával, more or less, that is less and less to be able to be represented, which was a time to the west of the deeper strata of society. In addition, the economic crisis and stronger, and potentially capable of getting mértéktelenebb emotions. 
In spite of all of the masses of impending lázadásáról "to speak frankly, it would be an exaggeration. 
But with his eyes open to it is not at all. 
On the wall, we szupererős sandwiched 
Sandwiched by means of a szupererős defeat the gravity and the wall like Pókember walk. 
The aim of this to more American Research Centre, and one in four by the institution of the place of close to the bottom of the group. 
One of the fellows ragasztódarabbal 2,5 négyzetcentiméteres only a 100 pounds to the body of a vertical wall and there is maintained. 
"The Science study of the American journals publikálta daytoni headed the university, the Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory in a few researchers felfedezéseit. 
The science team had been invented by the substance of existing special ú. coal nanocsöves N. construction materials, integrating it was born. 
"The glue of the operating principle must be very like a similar system of piping spagettihez package," says Atlantai Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology. 
The researchers covered the microscopic redőkkel gekkó drawn from the idea, which provides the perfect grip of the animal. 
The various materials, such as a bottle, with teflon csiszolópapírral and carried out tests indicated that the new glue ten times more effective, as referred to in the reptiles talpai, while, at the same time, "he breaks off the wall," explains Liming Dai, the engineering karának daytoni University researcher. 
Wall to walk? "That the substance of the provisional ragasztóként may be useful," added Liming Dai. 
We look at the wall, as Pókember? ", perhaps, but one of the researchers, they use less impressive than the interconnection of electronic devices, as well as the carbon nanocsövek because of the heat and the electrical current. 
You'll find TOVÁBBI application in the territory of the space. 
Even the szuperhősök can wait. 
The other research - of the University of California, Berkeley, a new ragasztóanyaggal to carry out experiments. 
The American Chemical Society (c) it in accordance with Article appeared in the California scientists a hajszálszerű, mikroszálas glue material, which on the surface during their movement to öntisztuláson goes through, he always perfect adhesion. 
MEDICINAL PRODUCTS? Gyümölcslével. It shall be prohibited!!!!! 
Shall be the grapefruit- vigyázni, orange and almalével. 
These are the high vitamintartalmú, mainly in the summer of popular szomjoltó beverages, if certain life-saving drugs are, together with the organism, changing their absorption, as the case may be attached, or less, depending on the impact that this may have serious health consequences too. 
The box or fresh fruit juices and certain products covered by the application of a combination of David Bailey, of the University of Western Ontario in London called attention to the professor. The Professor in Philadelphia in the national meeting of the American Chemical Society 236 announced: A glass of grapefruit-, orange and apple juice can reduce some of the life-saving medicines absorption, so that the remedial effects and jeopardizing the health of the patient. 
The grapefruitlé already has been on the bar, when it turned out that some of the antibiotic, antihisztamin, szorongáscsökkentő, szívritmus-szabályozó ideggyógyszer and to be considered toxic effects. 
Risky MEDICINAL PRODUCTS - Two years ago, had brought the Italian Pharmaceutical Institute published in the official gazette of the news, and at the same time, the doctors and patients to take seriously the risks referred to in the együttfogyasztással, and to listen to what you drink a bevételekor medicinal products, such as Diazepam or the Metadon. 
It is not just the grapefruit ", according to the researchers, the orange and apple juice contains substances, which impede the effectiveness of the medicinal products. 
It could be a long list of the active substances in the list, in which the absorption of the grapefruit and other fruit juices. 
This call to the attention of the Carruba Michele, a professor at the State University of Milan, pharmaceutical schedule: "These findings indicate immediately in the various national and international pharmaceutical companies, who, if necessary, to ensure that the change in the cosmetic product information. 
It is therefore must always be to read the report from the medicinal product is intended to be collected and, if not, don't allow ourselves to influence, but clearly ask kezelőorvosunkat or gyógyszerészünket, "Ansa - stressed the institute. 
Paul Krugman of the economic Nobel-díjat 
The American Paul Krugman of the economic Nobel-díjat, the commercial models and the context for the regional economic activity. 
Of the 55 years neokeynesiánus Krugman, a Princeton University to teach, and publicistája known as the New York Times. 
Krugman the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy measures, one of the sharpest bírálója. 
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attack, when the Enron went bankrupt, Krugman, a New York haven vezércikkében published in advance, announced that the latter event in the history of the United States of America still sorsdöntőbb consequences, as the ikertornyok collapse. 
There is little dispute that the forecast is not inspired, several times over the (, too, but as we now know, to be exact. 
"I am surprised, and a bit of a shock that the Enron and Worldcom how quickly the scandalous összeomlásán stepped beyond the közérdeklődés'," said Krugman at the end of 2002. 
A member of the European Central Bank in accordance with Lorenzo végrehajtó-bizottságának bini Smaghi, Krugman a "very valuable (", while, at the same time, a fairly "aggressive style of the Bush administration shall be drawn up against excessive liberalizmusával kritikáit." 
Open Office, it was also the third edition of the "Microsoft fighting" package, 
This appears in the OpenOffice.org 3.0 personal productivity, open programkódú alkalmazáscsomag, which, as an alternative to the Microsoft Office free of more and more layers of targeting the otthonitól felhasználókig office, both the közigazgatásig szabadfoglalkozásúaktól. 
The Sun Microsystem supervised by and by voluntary fejlesztők nearly a year after the work to be carried out through the new Open Office more újdonsággal to enter the public: The words on the screen and újragondolt, less Spartan users, in addition to the surface, also offers a more substantial new. Such as the Apple Mac OS X operational system of compatibility, as well as by the new, according to ISO Standard Format ODF (Open Document format) 1.2. 
This attention to the Office 2007 összeférhetőségnek in the system, so that the Open Office to be able to open the new extended Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx). 
It is interesting and even a few module for a specific function, like, for example, which makes it possible to reduce the size of the demonstrations, the PowerPoint. This may be useful in the case of fájlküldés by e-mail. Another function of the graphic modulba pdf files in support of the import of the oldalhelyes retention of the arrangement. 
While on the surface of this "hybrid pdf" létrehozhatunk documents, which combines the format of the typical Adobe táblázatkezelői szövegszerkesztői or components. 
The division within the alkalmazásokon also went through a number of development: The táblázatkezelő workbooks will support the common use of, but they work together to prevent felülírását. Each staff member hozzászólása marked in a different colour, which shall be assisted by a section of the control of the easier felismerhetőséget. 
A company already in the works, that some of the function of the OpenOffice Internetről (also available on the cloud, the cloud), and the next few weeks are likely to be the final version. 
The Italian versions, listed the Mirror on Friday has been found by the side of the English, which may be from the following: Http: / / it.openoffice.org / Download / 3.0.0 download300.html / 
In the case of the usual Windows and Mac programcsomag OS Linux-hoz, in addition to the operational systems available. 
Even in our kérésre, or even the installációs CD-t munkahelyünkön átvehetjük. 
At home, the application for the spread of the ingyenesség means it is likely to attract the greatest, but the Open Office programcsomag the business sector is now trying to get the ball, since a number of administrative and school project also. 
In the absence of small and medium-sized enterprises, not an ideal for education, advice and szervízszolgáltatások, which may open up new business prospects. 
The Open Office five basic failed module may consist of: Writer's, the Wordnek appropriate word; Calc, aimed at the Excel replacement táblázatkezelő; Impress, Powerpoint prezentációkhoz nature; the most Dbase, access adatbázis-kezelőhöz similar; and, finally, Draw graphics of the module. 
The 2008 goal to achieve the downloading of the 5 million. But if you take into account that the new versions with 3.600.000-nél already, it is likely that the number will be higher than expected. 
Kohl also have had a positive result, this was the fourth dopping-ügy 
The last stage of the Tour de France again had a positive sample one of the participating in the colours of the Gerolsteiner team competing Austrian Bernhard Kohl, who has been granted under the bronzérem due to the best hegyimenőnek vest. 
The news he had seen on the side of the internet Equipe newspaper. " 
Kohl of the 26 years of the fourth for a competitive, the Italian Riccardo Riccò Piepol and Leonardo, as well as the German, also Gerolsteiner-versenyző after Stefan Schumacher, who held the third generation version of EPO Cera-teszten produced positive results. 
Kohl vérmintáját, the tests carried out in the last few weeks, and the lausanne-i chatenay-malabry-i laboratories. 
If the control tests also confirmed the positive Cera results, the Austrian loses a third service, and for two years in accordance with the provisions of the versenyzéstől is forbidden. 
The Kohl EPO-tesztjének on the outcome of the third generation of positive news, Pierre Bordry, the head of the French Doppingellenes Agency confirmed, and the Associated Press hírügynökséggel said: "The positive doppingeredményt indicated the Austrian authorities. 
The 26 years of the Spaniard Carlos Sastre osztráknak behind Cadel Evans, and the American managed to stand on an elevated platform, and won the best hegyimenőnek spots for the vest. 
Immigrants: A NEW York Times be wondering what the issue, ITALY racist? 
In Italy, the country of kivándorlók only recently changed through the reluctantly adopted one of the favorite célpontjává immigrants. 
It is, therefore, through the "Belpaese" racist nemzetté? That is a question which is subjected to the New York Times, in which the young Faso Faso-i esetéből from Abdul William Guibre, who was assassinated in the past month Milánóban, for stealing a box of biscuits - a long article to the ongoing debate about racism in Italy. 
Well, that is the case, the New York Times' north paradoxonjának "shall be: In the northern regions of the" strongest the integration and the highest employment "at the same time," the bevándorló-ellenesség and the Northern League támogatottsága "here, too, the most powerful in the country. 
The Italians and the number of immigrants increased in support of the tension between the Milánóban NYT, Parmában, in Rome, and there have been cases of Castel Ciampinoban Volturnoban. 
And even. 
The Guild demanded by new laws, which fognák round the reins of the immigration, in connection with the illegal immigrants and megkönnyítenék removal, the changes have been terítékre hangulatváltozás as in Italy. 
The Pope and referred to in the trend of the Republican President highlights: "Giorgio Napolitano XVI Benedekkel met the Quirinale-palotában, and hinted that the State and to cooperate with the Church in order to overcome racism." 
The students Dráguló rental charges, or even a room may be 900 euróba 
The market hostels egyetemistáknak issued shall not be affected by the crisis. 
The Sunia, Lakásbérlők Szakszervezetének a student, according to the most recent survey of 900 euro or even a single to pay me for his rooms Milánóban, 700-at in Florence, Rome and 600-at 650-et voyage. 
"The phenomenon is now an astonishing proportions," that the families of cylinders incumbent upon which the students - but not because of a broad sections of the possibility of learning, "said Laura Mariani, the leader of the study agency Sunia." In the cities of the Council of high demand for the students had distorted the market to such an extent that the local inhabitants fired against a general drágulási process. " 
In most of the cases, the ingatlanajánlatok also contain a series of irregularity: Not registered, not containing bérletidíj-korlátozást contracts related albérlettel. 
In accordance with the Sunia an extraordinary measure, it would be necessary to review the system by which the taxation of the possibility of maximálására prices. 
The survey found aspects of that Milánóban, a neighborhood of 450 euro Brianza ágyért elkérnek also; the price of a room Bande Nere 650 euros (in the region), on average, up to an amount of EUR 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but also the amount of EUR 900 Vittoria (region). 
Florence, a ágyhely average 350 / 400 / euróba, in a room approximately 700-ba. 
Bologna, where most of the students in the egyetemhez lives in nearby, a ágyhely 250 / 280 euróba if double, and 370-500 euróba, if there is a single room. 
In Rome in the area near the central egyetemekhez (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) in approximately 600 million is a one-man and a two-man 450-et ágyért in the room. 
EUR (550 a little cheaper than a one-man room), the prices for the rest of the university and the neighborhood of Cinecittà Ostiense (1). 
In the suburban districts may be spórolni them: 300 euróba is a bed and 450-be Prenestina in a single room, Centocelle and other similar districts. 
A voyage ágyhelyért 300 / 450 euro is requested a me for his rooms from 400 to 600 to EUR. The árfekvés Policlinico, and Colli Aminei Vomero, the highest in the neighborhood. 
In a 250 / 350 ágyhelyért Bariban shall be paid in euro, and at least one of the single 350-et me for his rooms. 
The smaller towns, in absolute terms, although the prices lower, but they represent a greater weight within the urban büdzsén. 
In the cities, such as, for example, Perugia, where students often seek outside the EU, another anomalies in: The foreign diákoktól rent for about 25 to 30 per cent higher than in the case of the Italian tenants. 
"Good old Cinema Paradiso, in the cities of the old mozitermek over 
Of the Multiplexek HAGYOMÁNYOS cinemas closed. 
"One of the town, where there are no cinemas, blind city, without a face like a eyes." 
The director Giuseppe Tornatore drawn up by all the images, by the end of the show, in which the Italian nagyvárosokban, but also in the regions of the country. 
"It is in the suburbs on the disappearance of the great többtermes cinemas appearance, and as a result, the city centres situated egytermesek elsorvadása visszafordíthatatlannak process," and appeared to be inevitable, but at the same time, private shall be borne by all the characteristics of a real cultural crime. 
When history is full of memories, and appear to be the places, "such as to go to a friend, a familiar, many of whom we and our experience," says the director on the Cinema Paradiso. The film, twenty years ago that Oscar charge, as well as the Cannes fesztivál nagydíját Tornatorénak said, a little movie tells the story of a lyrical, the desire, after a moziélmény, which lost for ever. 
The operators of the largest association of the data communicated by Anec clearly: In the last five years, 316 traditional cinema closed. The maximum loss in cinemas könyvelhették nagyvárosokban: 10 cinema closed in Florence, 9 Milánóban,, Bologna and in Rome, Torinóban (6) and 5 in Palermo. 
In one of the most of the regions concerned shall Emilia-Romagna, which lost 82 egytermes movies, and Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41). 
And that was the multiplexek eltűnésükért penetration proves that he is not responsible for the better, since that point of Italy, the highest of the three regions of the newly open többtermes cinemas number: In the last five years, the number of rooms 195-tel in Lombardy, 81-gyel Toszkánában and ugyanennyivel Emilia-Romagnában. 
"The number of units in Italy in a manner that increased," says the chairman of the Anec Protti Paolo. "It's all right to build new facilities, but also to ensure the survival of those should be, because when an urban cinema: Not all odajáró refused to go through the multiplexekbe. 
Not to mention the operators feltöltetlen intended to support the financial funds: The state has about 10 million owed to the euro. 
Ethical and moral point of view, it is shameful that the government fails to comply with the legislation in force at the time. 
To maintain the market for 16 to 18 million euro a year would be necessary ". 
In the specific case of attention Bologna. This is the first Italian town, which is in excess of the closures, decided that the foreign and in downtown egytermes cinemas in order to help boost the protection and, in the case of an agreement between the government and the Anec through to remedy the problem. 
Among the types covered by the provisions of the tax incentives for operators, as well as the benefits of the accessibility to the public: The spectators behajthatnak restricted zones and certain parkolókban preferential tarifával parkolhatnak. 
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities, like other than the imposition of measures, but they will follow the example of Bologna. 
But it is also sure that the traditional moziknak, in order to be able to compete with the fight by the multiplexek, need to the sound and képminőségen, because the public much more selective. 
Preserving the traditional movie for me it was always important question: "The closure of the Supercinema Bagheriában - where the children and ifjúkoromat - that was the spark that, because I've done it at the Cinema Paradiso-t, although it was 10 years ago, I thought of it. 
I live in Rome, 25 years ago, when in the locked in the Via Rialto Nazionalén go before or at the Quirinale, so that they do not see the dust blackened posters, rather than the head trunk-like. So much experience here was part of " 
The close ties between the 'ndrangheta and policy, was arrested Gioia Tauro mayor 
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro Piromalli-klán supported the interests of the government decisions." 
In the event of a serious charges drawn up by the Executive Board calabriai Maffiaellenes Gioia Tauro alpolgármestere and mayor of judges, Giorgio Torrione song and Rosario Schiavone, as well as the mayor of Carlo Martelli Rosarno against bűnszövetkezetben was I arrested this morning in charge of external participation. 
Bands have been Gioacchino Piromalli, of the clan and the senior intermediary between the administration, as well as of the same name, Politely, a lawyer practising under his nephew, who has previously been convicted maffiaszerű bűnszövetkezetben participation, and up to a maximum of EUR 10 million in damages on him. 
"Any legal and moral rule ignorance of grammar, what is more, for the good of the ízlésé," is the államügyészek. The two local authorities declared his intention of advisory fee to get out of paying rent Piromalli lawyer. 
"So the klánnak officially certainly would have been arriving at the Hotel de Ville, which would have been given the opportunity to manage the administration and control, which was already significant. 
Agazio Loiero, the calabriai region, it is not the President of the General Assembly, in the region have been subjected to "a number of collusion in the local institutions and organised hell, ': There are areas where the Mafia against stronger than elsewhere, where the collusion consisted almost inevitable. 
However, a local politician SZÁMOS to withstand the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, they are the heroes, who shall remain clean. " 
On the morning of July letartóztatások folytatásai events, when the police announced that the Piromalli-klánt lefejeznie. 
At the end of April, was the local politicians from the government for the management of their. Gioia Tauro in municipal committee once the abolition, even in the fight against organised crime between local authorities and the presumed concentrations. 
Giorgio Torrione song, the feloszlatáskor regnáló kereszténydemokrata mayor, in the second round of the 2006 jobbközép koalíció. 
He said, when the Megyeháza feloszlatását ordered the government committee. 
The Court of Justice Minister of Interior, alternate idéztette Minninit Marco, and had accused him of that political purpose nursed everything but the court for the arrest order he signed this morning that the Piromalli-klán had gone so far as to say that the A3 project should change. 
The song Torrionével lehallgatásból imposed against the államügyészek "by" that "he was willing to an extensive, the Piromalli known to be close to the family of the person to be able to meet the claims representative of the group, the klán-érdeknek subject to the decisions of the government." 
The energy of the coming in, and now the big 
An inexhaustible source of 70 percent of the planet's surface, and that he had only just discovered the large international energiacégek 
Waves, tengeráramlatok, tides and renewable energy sources, which have been subjected to a giants, like the Chevron, who is now in the hands of the officers rátenni. 
MÁR searching the possibility of a hundred years ago, how could it be that the sea mozgásaiból energy. The '1970 years, at the time of the first olajválság research to grow. 
Around 1980, when the price of crude oil, the use of marine energy félretették idea, but today imposed by the requirements of the protection of the environment and the increase in the price of crude oil to give a new impetus to the sector. 
The London of the World Energy Council (WEC) in 2007, according to the estimate of 15 per cent of the world's electricity needs to be covered by the seas hullámzását treatment facilities. 
This shall be equal to twice the quantity, which is currently the nuclear power stations. 
In addition, there would be the currents and the tidal. 
Of the giants her. 
The Enersis was the first of the firm, which has embarked upon the marine energy, and signed an agreement in 2005 a Észak-Portugáliában erőműről intended. 
Forradalmi step, it seemed, and when the signature. 
Two years have passed since then, and more and more of the company will be down to each of the marine energy, including those who had come to the traditional energy is committed to promoters. 
"The study of the recovery of the oceans, Chevron energy technologies, and to consider the possibility of cooperation with us," said the American olajipari spokesman for one of the giant of an associated company of, the Wall Street Journal economic napilapnak. 
The question in cooperation with the American energiabizottság, issued by the marine energy use of Alaska project for obtaining the necessary authorisation for the job. 
It is not a little importance, especially if you take into account that the US was Alaszkában kőolaj-kitermelést engaged, and President Bush recently launched a plan for further fúrásokra. 
In addition to the Chevronon Verdant Power Inc of the New York and New Jersey shore of the ocean Power in the sea by way of raising energy. The amounts invested, to know the details may be increasing érdeklődésről do. 
The technology is developed. 
Yet, according to the experts, the primitive technology, but also because of the sea from the energy does not remove doubts concerning the environmental impact. 
The existing, the portugáliaihoz skóciaihoz or similar establishments, both small size, in respect of the ecosystem and therefore do not cause too great a problem. 
In order to comply, however, that a larger scale energy can be produced, it is necessary to installations, which are also significant environmental impact. 
As far as possible többféle exists: The ocean Power, for example, a interconnected bójarendszert. 
The waves generated by the bójákat lökéseket moving up and down, and the pistons and placed them nyomássá hydraulic cylinders. 
The pressure was a turbinát, which feeds and a generator. 
The electrical current to the electric under the sea in the land. 
Of the four egyenlőre is the establishment of a similar nature of the design stage, which only the federal approval for the energy produced a part of a military establishment használnák fel. 
The Verdant Power, on the other hand, the East River in New York in the firth six submarine turbines has already started using the power of a shopping centre and a parking. 
The movement of water Árapálykor takes the turbine lapátjait, and this is the forgómozgás the generator. 
The Verdant claimed that there is a long list of contain information concerning the agencies with, who only the energy necessary to make use of licences. 
After the tidal waves. 
Currently, special attention to deserve to be exploited by the tidal opportunities. 
Although it is a temporary phenomenon, the tidal előreláthatóbb, like the wind, the sun, or the waves and, therefore, is considered a more reliable source. 
In New York, Maine, and in Alaska, as well as the other coastal State 7,5 million in 2008 dollars, was supplied by the tidal energy exploitation. This is the amount of the 35 million 2009-ben woman.
