Food guilty at European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured are the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the euro area, the increase in November higher than expected, after the percent in October was an annual inflation rate of 3.1% channels as the statistical office of the European Union in Luxembourg reports.
Official predictions are only 3% as a basis, Bloomberg announced.
Unlike the American, British, Canadian Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower. According to your discretion, the rate of interest the increasing raw material prices and the easy drop in unemployment, the formation of an.
The ECB, inflation is under two percent, or at least just at the.
According to an analyst the ECB in the double: you must "arrange" the inflation in order to exclude later action need.
With 3.3%, the inflation rate in November in Germany a; in Spain, the rate of climbed upon%.
Responsible for the rise in inflation in the euro zone, higher food and energy prices.
The MATIF rose by 88 per cent, and of course also soybeans reached a record since 1973.
Also with edible oil and milk products, there was a substantial increase in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil increased this year around 52% - in the last month, the price per barrel of the black gold 100 of the US dollar.
The ECB will, inflation in the year 2008 from rise to 2.5%, but one counts in 2009 with a drop of 1.9%.
For the coming months 3-4 comes from a number of the annual, however, with 2.1%.
For 2008 Experts reckon that the ECB will decrease the.
Gallup locates government crisis
After long stagnating the number of the by early December considerably. First times since 2002 the party has the greatest basis camp, while the agreement for the Socialists according to a Gallup unprecedented low of 13% has achieved.
With the party faithful voters the difference, it is thanks to the determination of the very high, more than two thirds (71%) are a fifth (20%) approval for the opposite.
MDF and szdsz lie according to inquiry under the parliamentary entrance hurdle: you come in on two per cent of the total population.
The number of the two camps is up to 1%.
Compared to the last low the general economic atmosphere worsened - never before, the proportion of the economy of the country as "expressed badly" high judge (41%), while other 46% "for" quite bad.
According to prospects in the spring and summer of the families see the change of their financial situation once again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population reckons a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth goes out of an improvement.
A carried out in December showed that 71% of the interviewees - a historical high - the work of Prime Minister as bad "rather than" judged right.
Thirteen percent of the interviewees have great confidence or confidence generally in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the percentage of supporters is forming 38 percent for Viktor.
About 54% not trust the politician, compared to 27% of distrust of the party leader of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those who think one could get the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister also without regime change in the grip.
After the riots in last October still 35% for the whereabouts of the government and of the government itself, this part amounts today only 20%, while the relative majority (33%), the only solution is called for.
For their interest in the referendum answered 60% that they participate "with security", and another 20% their vote "," would probably give.
For the comparison: if the parliamentary elections on this Sunday, would only 55% "to" go to the further 15% hold their participation for "probably." in the light of these tendencies, the result of the referendum is obvious.
74% would against tuition fees, 79% against the charge and 84% against the vote.
Put down on the group at the referendum "to" participating, the parts of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital charges even 81 to 84, and / or 89%.
At the most expensive, Tesco increases by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in also have this year the average increase in prices of 16% from the last year, with the difference this year that there is no increase in the value-added tax.
Article from napi gazdaság
In the budaoerser, the price of the usual Christmas "napi" also this year around 16% were increased, but in all price increases of more registered.
After the prices in the food markets last December "," the price increase not out to be drastic, compared with the previous already high level.
However, it has an effect on consumers certainly as a deterrent that that is what they are, in the last year still far below paid hoof, not even for 10,000 this year is available.
The price of the "napi" basket crossed the by at least 91 hoof studied in the markets.
The highest price amounted hoof.
(the price, at 6.800.)
The prices for unicum and live fish almost remained on previous, have, on the other hand the prices for nut and poppy.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, there were cut, however, for forint 139.
There was no mention product limited price slump with less than 200 forint.
This is also what the price of a stroke of under two Coca-Cola 200 forint, thus the drink cost including pledge only in 257.
Nevertheless, this year in the "napi" at the most expensive and at best.
Our calculations indicate that the prices in the "napi" market basket vis-à-vis the Christmas prices in the last year, while Tesco around 15 and 18% cut in each case raises.
The difference between the cheapest market basket of the previous year and the most expensive of this year amounted to 12%, while the increase between market basket of last year and this year formed of 21%.
The average price rise, 1.480,00.
The average increase in prices was still at 1,206.00 last year, however, the tax increase in prices to apparent last Christmas.
Just this process found the trade badly: seemingly the department stores could not decide so right which price margin they should use in the individual articles, because the effects of the increase in prices for the consumer, unpredictable.
(if the vendor is on the rotation speed of a product badly, it can fall around essential profits in the price margin that follows the undertaken.)
The price increase of the "napi" turned out in the last year so radically, that the most expensive basket the value of 2006 about 1720 exceeded, whereas the difference in prices at the cheapest basket only 844 forint was.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost about 1.630,00 forint more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a rise in prices of 1,284.00.
In the comparison of the two last Christmas showed a catastrophic increase in prices, the price of the daily consumer items on the in less than 20 months for more than 30% per year.
(this is not necessarily confirmed the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, with some basic food the statistical office in the period of 12 months a more than a price increase.
So in about beside flour also with eggs.)
However, one looked into the "napi" market basket, this seems almost impossible with the latter, because the price of the product already in the previous year even in the worst case for little more than 10 per cent.
Obviously are in a stronger position than the egg - after all they could the drastic increase in prices to the multis shift.
In the golden the hypermarkets do not complain, constantly about good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores does not look at the prices more.
From all large quantities are bought, lasting foods go in over the counters.
Wednesday morning, all three department stores endless with the cash when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, the country is a smaller customer frequency reports, so that many multis deplore themselves with the, they could not achieve even the planned turnover, and not just with food, but also with lasting consumer goods.
In many places saving
This year more than a thousand infections in hospitals that due to inappropriate handling antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overload of personnel - factors, that the embankment of the infections are not just benign so the leading doctor of the national.
In many cases also near the saving.
In the traumatology-department of the to hospital a mrsa-infection was diagnosed recently.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient, after a serious accident to the hospital.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured person of a hard car accident was released from the hospital, the man had little later return, however, with a mrsa-infection an important because of the operation, since that is still in the body of patients, not yet carried out.
Until 10 December of this year from hospitals activated by pathogens infections scale to the national nosocomialis surveillance system, so the leading doctor of the national,.
So many activated by scale, pathogens infections were registered in the hospitals therefore with security, may be higher in the darkness.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were against by the methicillin-oxacillin of resistant staphylococcus unnecessarily.
The staphylococcus (SA) bacterium bears about a third of the people in their nose without its causing an illness.
SA limited infections (as inflammation of the throat, tonsillitis, inflammations of the skin or wounds) react mostly well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
The means are however measured out too high or used, arise from the well respondierenden antibiotics resistant bacteria under appropriate conditions spread out in the hospitals quickly.
In the case of patients with badly or permanently immune systems, but also in older, or patients with small body weight can these bacteria difficult infections, such as or wound poisoning, therefore, cause.
The scale of the medical according to hospital is nothing special, such occurrences life.
One must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, manhte a - there are not only there, where it is not searched.
Resistant to antibiotics
"such patients are isolated, the nursing staff bears rubber and masks the supply, and we have the antibiotics, necessary for the treatment of" - so.
With their admission into the hospital to the patients to be examined, not always an infection can be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of initiated by infections in hospitals would be avoidable, however the currently prevailing conditions and conditions for the checking of stemming the origin or the spread of the virus, says.
After this infection mainly in hospitals and homes for the elderly, the taken patients should examine and mrsa-infected immediately isolate.
In the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological sampling is not quite so often.
Last but not least because it sides of the national health no subsidies for this investigation.
Most cases would not come to light before then therefore if anybody has a noticeable, according to the medical head of the epidemiology Center.
In addition, the European Union, there are strict recommendations regarding the appropriate use of antibiotics in the humane medicine, there is, however, also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and clinical pictures.
Antibiotic therapies are supposed to be precise, that is, microbiological studies are necessary, so that no resistance to the means, however, that this directive is not always kept by hospitals either.
Under the or in the basic contained patient microbiological sampling are even more scarce, however.
In the case of the saving will
Scientific evidence proves that to patients with one of the most widely on the other is transmitted by nursing staff.
So the manual washing, or carrying gloves and masks a great importance, however, there are also in this area considerable shortcomings in the hospitals.
To is transmitted through droplet infection or contact in the indigenous hospitals, it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are even often full the beds connected barely even epidemiological view between them from a distance of at least 1.5 meters should be.
As karolina keep saying, it happens unfortunately in the financially less well set hospitals even that near saved, there are few nurses, many patients - factors, which almost favour the emergence of infections.
Such infections are demonstrably far less frequent there or the further spread of the virus can be stopped where these protective measures are followed, however.
Against to government Program
In handle causes enormous costs for the health insurance, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example the prevention of, or to their containment held in the government program.
After the first signs is successful - as published data prove, the tendency of the declining in England.
The European heart for illness prevention (ECDC), the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant (including), as well as to the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.

Bulgaria, the EU
The development of the Bulgarian property market - all of Europe looks attentively at the Balkans state formerly rarely mentioned.
What, where, and who still have to buy the cheapest market, the EU becomes more expensive wildly?
An analysis of the Bulgarian re / Max division.
Bulgaria is currently without a doubt the plaster for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with most and houses in the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions bansko, borovec, pamprovo and the popular, too, at the sea albena ", the", the "," and the historical and the properties, but rather around kavarna and balcik asked more and more.
According to estimates of re. Or in Bulgaria also the inland sooner or later, to attract investors, for example, gabrovo, Elena, and triavna, and also expressed the area of records more buyers.
The capital Sofia offers also enticing offers - trade and office areas offer highest yields.
Bulgaria is on the best way to one of the most attractive European, and so the next summer and winter season also in the other two seasons attract tourists.
Foresighted investors shop therefore are already in great style, for example around bansko.
According to people in Bulgaria, seek the properties and that a change of their conduct.
Most purchasers British, there are prospects however also come from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present while there are being in the Black Sea and mainly Russian purchasers.
There are three groups of foreign buyers says regional director of re..
Those who want to establish themselves, either to buy properties 50100.000 euro or descended houses by 50-100.000 euro, which they then.
Good connection and accessibility and communication possibilities are largely written, but also the proximity to a city, businesses and doctors are decisive for the buyers.
The second category, who in the search for a domicile (Bulgaria was in December under the top ten listed for vacation objectives of the Germans).
The third group make the businessmen, with the objective of a medium- to long-term increase in value.
In the capital properties are constantly more expensive, necessitated by the ever growing demand.
Within the EU, the lowest indeed in Bulgaria, in the last five years there was a price increase, however, around 21% annually.
The price increase with the real estate prices far exceeds the increase of salaries.
And the six percent of the Hungarian
As Secretary of the announced, the expert meetings end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international after 2012, the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries discuss about the timetable of Bali, in which the measures for the period after 2012, after the Kyoto protocols, are set.
Currently a fierce debate in progress between industry and development countries.
The United States has that they do not want to negotiate about concrete numbers, however, they would be ready until 2020 greenhouse gas emissions, the relative to 1990, in order to reduce percent.
The other great question of the conference is whether the industrial countries are ready, the reduction of emissions in the developing countries both financially marching.
There is also an agreement about the support was achieved by developing countries.
The Kyoto protocols Adaptation Fund is supposed to be administered by a 16-koepfigen advice, presumably at the Global Environment Facility (gef) of the UN, as in the "piac profit" is posted.
Hungary's six percent
Secretary of the States in the name of Hungary the effort of the EU took their with global, and to achieve a new international agreement to 2009.
The Minister said that the EU until 2020 greenhouse gas emissions, to reduce the 20% (from the values of 1990), regardless of whether the agreement is successfully obtained after 2012 ", or not, the Union would be even ready to support a reduction other great industrial nations of the world, and / or developing countries are also willing, their obligations after forces and responsibly.
Of the stressed that the aim of the States that joined the Kyoto in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2%, whereas the European Union with its then 15 Member States already committed to a minus of 8%.
The guideline for Hungary is reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6% in comparison with the years - a guideline will absolutely fill the country as in the press release of the Ministry of the environment is posted.
The stakes are high on Bali - after all, the long-term international agreements within two years ready, otherwise it would certainly have only come into force after 2012, which in this case would not renewed established in the Kyoto Protocol, international emission reduction consequences, whose importance also the IPCC, the international scientific distinguished with the Nobel Peace Prize of the UNO in his recent report has emphasized.
Through that the emission reduction would be delayed, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth more than 2 ° C inevitable, which would be extremely serious and irreparable consequences according to the result.
British army recruits on
The British army units, functional about operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, for the purpose of the portal.
First of all the British air force (RAF) discovers for itself: special units stationed in Afghanistan load since March 2006 videos on operations conducted against the Taliban into the net, the BBC tells.

Use in Afghanistan
Originally the air force has the videos, with the aim of soldiers, publishes, and as the says, the contributions serve also the purpose for informing the population of the actual objectives of the foreign actions.
Such kind published propaganda is almost freely compared to traditional, according to Gordon mackenzie to the BBC, however, these videos always take a certain amount of political message in itself, because the right to exist of military measures decided on by the government confirm its own way.
Recruiting Americans with game
The army must fight, however, also against which it beside the carefully worked on, zensurierten create functional into the network as well - such as such, show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda talks about the losses at most, the bloody pages of the war are not shown, however.
Of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, incidentally, has already been in use many videos loaded on the platform, this "type" the British but only recently for itself were discovered.
Meanwhile the Americans recruit on something different way, namely the shooting play "America's army" in which the players within the framework of a more or less in the skin of soldiers simulation can slip.

Political capital: Hungarian guard increases state risk
In the view of the Department of risk analysis (risk division) of political capital in the activities of this August with support from the "movement for a better Hungary" Hungarian created guard the risk of Hungary and the region in several respect.
In the "risk" of the institute does among other things: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk sets the "intensification of already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsies and in Hungary, even in the short term, which could lead to violent ethnic quarrels."
The main reason is the Hungarian guard, probably at the provocation of such a confrontation, for example at the research institute.
How reports, this is a failure on the part of the politically responsible considered: "public discussion of have with representatives of radical political grouping, who are now based their political strategy on the".
One presumes that the problem, the reasonable dialogue impossible extremities favour, as well as the probability of violent quarrels would increase.
The forschungsinsitut means the activities of the Hungarian guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the domestic and foreign media, "the picture of Hungary abroad substantially, particularly in confidence in the stability and democratic maturity is concerned."
We remember: since fall 2006 the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary is accelerating, so that since summer 2007 several association, "national" naming organizations were established.
"these groups is that in each case define as a civil organization, while they are boasting about that openly their members on - sometimes armed - tasks, preparing (disaster protection, national Defense), with reference to the unsuitability of the police, the army or the State itself," called it.
Further, and this in accordance with that method which is focused on the political and various moroseness of the population based, political efforts as civil initiative to camouflage.
The emphasis on civilian character and the association not merely serve the avoidance of legal hurdles in the course of the registration in court could emerge - it is also a political strategy.
What is to be understood from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian guard a risk factor for the relations with the States.
In recent months, the Hungarian guard in several States as a potential source of surveys, for politician of certain countries sees in the origin of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of his own.
All this has effects on the political stability of the region - it was called ".
From the point of view of the research institute the creation of the Hungarian guard no in, thus the political risk increased for the entire region.
As reports, the activities of the Hungarian guard comparable with those of the Bulgarian national guard, in the creation of the Bulgarian's National Union (bnu) was announced.
In the background of the Bulgarian guard were in a mass of Sofia quarters (krasna poljana) stood.
The bnu took as an opportunity the incidents for the establishment of the national guard, with the argument that the objective of the organization of the "national protection".
In their view, is the last 17 years a regular "palpable" in Bulgaria, the State remained, however, idle and indifferent - so political capital.
And further: the initiative would have a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public kicked loose.
As said that the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also proved by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to found their own guard.
There the activities of the Hungarian guard up to now many similarities with those of the Bulgarian national guard shows, not to exclude it is that the Hungarian Roma also with the organization of their own protection to react to the threats that it is called in the risk of political capital.
Attila juhász, research with political capital said on request of the report: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis published, and should is visible tendencies, the public opinion is informed, as in the case with the publication of the risk.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary holidays are dealt with by law, so that the procedure for the reorganization of the work days around the holidays has now been established, but the coming year little such days.
Also in the EU and in America one means something different by "holiday".
The Hungarian judicial system differentiates between state holidays and days.
Work free days are usually ecclesiastical holidays or are related with significant historical events.
We celebrate for example also new year: both the last day of the old, as also the first day of the new year, free days - for the latter to rest.
Throughout the year, we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state of 15 March are at the revolution of 1848, and 23 October, the anniversary of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August the establishment of state, on 1 May the work celebrated on 1 and 2 November we commemorate our dead.
In addition there are the two holidays to Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
As our Heads of State or religious holidays rare on a weekend fall, the practice of the "" proved itself in the cases in which we before or after the holiday only a day would work.
The price of the prolonged weekends, however, is that we are very probably work on Saturdays before it, or must go to school.
When that day before or after the holiday should be processed last finally, since long years by the Employment Minister in its own regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and takers for public employees and civil servants of the public service.
Only companies and facilities are excluded, in which the company without interruption, also at the holidays, is continued.
This only rules by holidays at the end of the year are damaged: from the 24th December remains life positively in this country as most of the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the holidays, particularly for it waived.

Six as a deterrent, in order to annoy
E-mails which we forget, we never receive - harmless lies, do not strike us anymore at all, ":" at work to the weekday.
The question is whether one becomes of these small inconvenience to put it better, or to the challenge and attempts these misleading, for other annoying situations consciously.
Tips.
'Sorry, I forgot to tell you that somebody of the marketing referred - a colleague says ".
That one missed a meeting through?
At best one regrets it and it is again when maybe one phones the marketing department and admitting, one would have forgotten to align the report which is the usual method).
Mostly the thing with an apology.
Before it, embarrassing excuses, one should consider inspire his colleagues can truly prepare unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Something borrowed, which does not belong to one?
There is hardly a little pithier than if a document, office accessories, or the telephone, but it is not there.
Yesterday, the still on the desk - it is today?
Or is lost believed ballpoint pens, for example on a colleague's desk?
No one should ask nothing of the colleagues borrow, because they are wonder if they find that something disappeared.
Thus, no covers or post office from the office put into the bag, because it could meet: no more because, if it's nevertheless urgently needs.
Ratchet over the private life of the colleagues?
There is no effective means, a which has already been put in the world to stop.
Who with whom, done something?
Where and why?
(IT) The information or suggestions about the private life of colleagues not to give way to build the nose!
And if someone opens and tells us its internal secret nevertheless, we should not misuse this confidence!
Best one keeps quiet as a grave instead of just is not present to adjust even if other about the problems of colleagues know also answer.
Without reason sick self-employed?
If one calls in the office in order invoking tormenting headaches sick to answer, because it just feels uneasy, or simply wants to rest, it should take a clear: one's own work, urgent, projects with firm dates must now instead of one's colleagues do.
Do not treat the colleagues badly therefore!
If one already knows at that, in the next day into the office will not create, or that something could get in the way, for which one must stay at home, one should announce it in time so that neither the colleagues, nor the head unexpectedly with the absence.
Hum, tittering, phoning
One is hollow just in his work, but by the loud giggle of the colleagues disturbed?
Unintentional a telephone conversation that one should not have heard better?
One should not the colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations (one leads over their heads), trample, or permanent moaning nerve.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not just in a task (to write) are planning to organize deepened.
The other is to blame?
A project is not period ready, one has an important letter or forgotten important nachrichte to send, should be the fault of the own forgetfulness not look at other!
As far as possible one should not to the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
Best one admits his errors and excuses if others were also affected by it!
To combine the mistake again, or which missed retrieve can only too, is inadequate!
In the office - a sense as at home?
Pants and schlapfen: force for at home, but has been lost in the office nothing!
Not even then one should dress so Leger if the job approved it actually!
Only not to become too - one should both his colleagues, and as far as that itself respect one dresses in according to the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Wants to prepare - or as one becomes uninteresting
Stop and, the car right in the traffic.
From the radio a strange rings out: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I turn the volume.
The speed changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a real choir.
It is the song "wings of love of the", on onmr2.
The domestic music scene has for a long time, not just with delicately.
However, now one sees even the traffic different if one hears the new album of.
The appearance of so many to new and exciting production from the domestic digital underground wearing slowly to a change of the overall picture, and even if the skirt with his gitarrengequitsche is again "in" the domestic proves: there is new under the sun.
In pécs Balázs, ranging from even in the volumes to before he - perhaps, because a pub no two piper - his own path to follow.
The breakthrough with his project (zagar) and its music which elements from jazz, electronic and pop, he only together, but as one with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film had approached him (i.e.
"szezon" of Ferenc töroek).
The formation, which had arisen at first in smaller clubs, was known to the wider public first, as the magazine "wan2" their first album from the year 2002 under the top 50 French and zagar, together with almost only to, for example, also in the West marketable trendsetter.
Without a doubt, and its volume "trendy," it is not interested but whether they bear this brand also with pleasure.
The band reacted, as it should, with a new, even better album.
The now appeared new album entitled the "cannot walk fly" could open new paths for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the pécser years.
The expression originates indeed from the time when Balázs still away with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be also in order, to fall, however, next to the character of the - the spirit and the trends louder, because of the influences of the rock piano 'n'.
With these songs of living in England, and with the band "the puzzle" working singer himself during the premiere in.
A song of the album it even for the radio hit - since one from early to pop music late pet, "This the listeners with the number of" wings of love, "the participation of six domestic singers stars") ("received, successive the created.
All right, then (?).
The hvg.hu has enquired at Balázs.
Hvg.hu: this new raises the question: to what extent does your music of a certain shift remain reserved?
Balázs: the term "i" means not just much.
In my opinion, there are two classes in the pop music, and indeed not mainstream and underground or and pop but rather commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground can be shallow and meaningless, but also as it can only be produced for the sale of commercial power to music.
Also a good pop number can arise from an honest motive.
The acceptance of listener functions also according to this principle, independently of languages and borders.
Hvg.hu: do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and of foreign public your music?
As zs.: abroad, in particular West of us the pop music has a greater tradition.
There not only on teenagers or concerts, but also the older audience.
They pursue the trends in the pop music, which happen around them, much more attentive, because they also for a part of the contemporary culture.
Hvg.hu: what role is attributed to the public during?
It is important, who, where, how many hear your music?
As zs.: it is, of course, a good sense to see that more and more to come to our concerts.
We must never, however, for the market.
For the music does not arise in order to serve a purpose, but for a particular reason.
The role of the public is perceptible mostly at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but there is only prolong the unreachable changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, one struck me: you want to make it all right, you are not more interesting.
Hvg.hu: how far you like to follow the example of?
He is under way, and as has his career in the West.
As zs.: we do not in fact his way, once completely disregarded the fact that one attempts again and again in our music.
We see rather than which on the presence of other musical trust and they unfolded.
At the beginning of our work, comparisons with the inevitable to, as several of us come from his band and took another way.
Hvg.hu: in the wings of "wings of love" stands in the first place.
Many have only in connection with this number is the name.
Was the opening with a somewhat style in the direction of a wider public conscious?
As zs.: we had no plans to write a train horse, then for the excuses.
Here it is a question of more song.
It was considered as a final of the, with which we and the a little more difficult issues will disappear.
Hvg.hu: how did you the six singers?
Why is it, which was the guidance principle?
As zs.: the idea was to make a gospel well-behaved chorus.
Then came the talented choir from soloists of the indigenous music scene.
So the six-headed choir arose - for sena, edina kutzora, péterfy, eniko "hodosi [neo], sena,, which then we" apäter stars "underground.
Hvg.hu: you have the song just or do have it the girls?
As zs.: there was the number in the longer, but when the material was ready for the album, we thought that this number is "something needs".
The piecework has positively asked for a song voice.
I still rings out in the same night, later the girls learned it.
There has been virtually everything immediately and frightening spontaneous.
I can remember, I was then fairly, but it has already needed the "stars" as well.
With my voice alone the song would never have become.
Hvg.hu: both on the plate, as well as in concert had the impression, the girls would be in the background.
There is not any solo (except for the short solo of), they have no own role completely sing together and are not louder than the music, therefore their gesang not only accompanied from the music.
Also on the stage they stood behind.
Is it intention?
B.zs.: that they are stood at the rear was so because of purely technical problems.
However we wanted to them consciously not solo roles.
In the number is also that you forget his ego a little bit, who have forgotten where and where it is on the way, we are simply too, that this particular wing, the wings of the love.
I would like that also other sense this euphoric State we felt when the song arose.
Hvg.hu: what was the most extensive song?
As zs.: during the musical work work actually none, it has rather while mixing more difficult tasks.
For example with "dorian Gray's dilemma", in which I play on a or with "rock piano 'n goes to the girls" where the groove not work longer, but little by little everything turned out, as in the case of a puzzle.
Hvg.hu: what is your album of the new?
As zs.: that changes with the concerts constantly and also now, where I have the album "losgelasssen".
Currently it is "prophet is a", "escape from the earth" and the number of "never the same".
Fraudulent broker risked because of inferiority feelings billion
Bottomless crooks
It calls its former Société Générale employees of the French Société Générale, owners of banka done.
She lost indeed almost five billion euros because of it.
It seems, however, rather so that only one of the big players, wanted to do it like his colleagues in addition surely incapable was.
In contrast to all large in recognizing it at the amerikanischenn mortgage the crisis.
"It is psychologically rather weak" was from the mouth of his superiors said, announced it near the police.
But what follows from the statements that the French media, for example the newspaper Le Monde, published, he was a man, at the end of last year with its business profits of 1.6 billion euro had obtained.
Crisis not only in America
"All which I wanted was for my bank to earn money", he says in his statement.
In it, he was able to the American crisis half a billion euro.
The opportunity in addition it had already at the year beginning.
In February there was already first news about so-called mortgages prime customers or such like, who had already in former times, then would be in trouble.
Influence on the whole economy, but this crisis should not have.
Générale did not believe that and was right.
At the end of the year, he had his profit up to 1.6 billion euro.
"I have as the first half billion had earned, I did not know, as I should explain that to" Générale and continue to say that he did not keep anything definitively for itself.
During the whole it admits that it forged documents so that he may not come.
He succeeded even be duped by his bosses, too, even in its revision for businesses interested.
Risk profit
Did he fear to fly up?
Hardly.
"I thought, that they the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the Bank, satisfies."
Where he has had the courage to risk so much?
He had to gain its position gradually.
It came into the in the year 2000, immediately after he ended his study at the Lyons university, had a.
His annual salary was about 51000 dollars.
After two years he was already assistant a broker and in the year 2005, he an independent broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollars.
Nevertheless he knew that he will never earn as much as others.
"already at my first debated in the year 2005 I knew that one observed me.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development, "said the investigator.
But happens soon after it came out of the first major success.
With the stocks of the Alliance he earned a lot with the London embassy bombings by half a billion euro on, this title.
And that was the catalyst - now he wanted more.
Carried out unless it profit makes, we leave you
"this is like a snowball", he said to the police.
But the Heads of knew supposedly or suspected it.
"as long as I earned money, the eyes of the people."
Then came at the beginning of this year the great blow.
On a single day he lost a billion euros.
At a weekend in the middle of January, he wanted to balance that.
When he came to work on Monday, he was not more 'of the Bank.
A few days later, the Bank announced that she lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they come it on the?
It looked suspicious through a holiday.
"I have only four days of the previous year.
A broker, does not take any vacation is one who does not want you to look to him into the cards said, "definitively.
The Czech Republic has the chance to come to 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed yesterday a total of nine development programs through which the Czech Republic in the next few years to 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Crowns) do.
It concerns here approximately half of the Czech Republic, the sum in the years 2007 to 2013 will actually receive from Brussels.
Approximately 125 billion Crowns come from seven programs.
Czech companies about 100 billion Crowns from the agenda "and" assigned to get innovation.
Most money, approximately 150 billion, into the traffic flow.
The traffic program is the greatest development program and covers up to 22% of the funds, the Czech Republic, can receive from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State next year 90.8 billion will do.
This innovation "and" is supposed to serve entrepreneurs and companies to winning resources to innovative enterprises.
The companies, which are intended to finance for the introduction of new technologies, for research, but also for the introduction of more effective organization methods.
With the previous geld-aquisition from EU funds belongs among the new accession countries, has become the most successful.
Nicaraguan Court confirms twenty year long prison sentence for ex-presidents
A court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the twenty detention for the former President Arnold Alemán, he 2003 because of finance fraud of 100 million dollars (almost) billion Crowns had been condemned.
Later, however, he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hazienda near the nicaruanischen metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American State finds out grating again is currently unclear according to the news agency.
The chairman of the Court of Appeal, ileana Pérez, as a result of the now and it will depend on whether they serve out his punishment at home, or whether it needs to jail.
A court rejected four years after that regularly money out of the government at the accounts of foreign companies in Panama, delayed.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts belonged in reality to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money finally landed in a fund, for financing of his election campaign 2001 had established.
Budget is through
Yes, it is created.
The national budget is approved.
What is special one at this budget?
It is the first budget which this government projected, and without the support of opposition was accepted.
For the current year still with the ssd (social democrats), because it ministers endorsed (of this party) had submitted, and it therefore could not allow to refuse it.
Unlike the lively debate in front of the vote on the motion of no against the government nothing dramatic happened this time.
The Parliament approved have noticed, yet this is highly important law calmly.
This is, as it were, the paradox here.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and positions of the budget, whether one likes or not.
The budget is an essential component of the policy, however covered by the power of the government and the opposition.
This is a topic for the media, and therefore they dedicate more attention to it.
A quarrel among politicians is much more interesting for the public as a sober numbers.
The national budgets suffered from the last social democratic governments under three weak points that the budget for the year 2008 at the same time eliminate not:
The first is the high proportion of spending, because of law obliging, at which it does not only concern the pensions, but also to the spending the "implicit" coalition of ssd and ksm (Communists) in the last year before the choices.
The second is the fiscal account as a consequence of the first.
The third restriction consists in the deficits of the public finances, i.e. the deficits of the municipalities.
The greatest risk is not, however, the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and eingermassen under control.
A real time bomb is, however, the budget deficit of the Communities.
Many mayors gave in order to save incomes from taxes, and bank credits further sources for investments, often mostly from financing through which they caused their city halls in the excess.
In recent years, enabling them, these debts by massive sales of stocks of energy and other supply networks, in which they had received from the State to pay off.
Now this source has already dried up.
As far as we adhere only to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy for some years, as the rest of the world, a growth through, whose incessantly boasts about ran the.
That represented a unique possibility for their governments, public finances in order.
Instead, the state of these governments were, however, still more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have much more reasonable than our Republic.
That is a giant disgrace which mainly be ascribed to the former governments.
We belong to the countries in the global scale, seen the least of poverty are threatened.
This is not, unfortunately, social nassiven needed just in the last years very in gigantic extent was blown up.
Even if it is able, a part of the unreasonable populist spending, which were adopted this year before the elections, altogether, if it is clear that soon lead to a shift of the pension entry age and come to a reform, then virtually any policy in this country, and, very quickly, who is in power, he will not have anything as a pure administration.
It is only easily exaggerated if it is, then, that existing officials from politicians, who are the largest part of the tax revenues mechanically on pensions and social.
Therefore the this year's budget can not be a revolution, but it can only the expulsion of normal outputs by duty.
The deficit intended for 2008 of 70 billion Crowns would be quite superfluous if former governments in the last ten years have not spent, which only worked.
If we do not want that in fact it results in that, at verwaltungsbeamte from ruling politicians, then we must be patient and this strong coalition government too, that it is conscious that the state can issue only as much as he taxes and fees is able to take rest during the preparation of further wish.
Only these facilitate a gradual enforcement of a balanced budgets.

Banks want to overcome crisis
The American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada decided on together against the crisis on the financial markets.
So more than 100 billion dollars by means of auctions on the currency markets.
On these auctions, the banks auction interest rates, to which they are ready to lend money mutually.
For example the American fed sends 40 billion dollars on auction, other 24 makes them for the European and the Swiss Central Bank.
It is after the attacks of, is the first time that the central banks of the individual States to such a coordinated procedure for the defense and / or reducing the consequences of a financial crisis.
This step is to "remove the greatest difficulties of the economy, the increasing lack of free capital that the banks can lend" in a report for its customers Bernard pool of the consulting firm economic outlook group.
"the coordinated action of the central banks, the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65% to around 50%," added in his report.
The banks have because of not operated credits already around 60 billion dollars, particularly in the United States.
Analysts expect still further losses.
"this central banks must really had fear before it, which still everything can follow when to this procedure decided," said of ABN AMRO, kieran Davies.
It appears that the situation is really bad "he passed on.
The central banks have the fear that if the banks themselves have access to loans heavily, credits even more expensive for their customers.
That would reduce the consumption and the American economy into a recession, possibly with impact on economic growth, on the whole world.
The central banks decided, after they failed to in lower the so-called 'with the London between banks will be used.
That means that the banks were afraid continuously to lend money each other, and that although the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain during the autumn had lowered their interest rates repeatedly.
"that will have the same effect as a further drawdown of interest rates," said salvaggio of Greg tense consulting of the Agency Reuters.
Some believe that this step of the central banks contributes to the heating of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, and indeed the case of the property market in the US.
Klaus: debates of the ecologists are unbelievable
Global climate changes supposedly most damage developing countries.
President Václav Klaus commented again on the problems of global warming.
The criticism referred now supposed to the end of the UN International Conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where his book "no" blue, green planet, he presented, that the debates of the ecologists are.
According to Klaus not only the structure of the conference that forms a strange mixture of government representatives and such of non-government organizations, but also of the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it, and the reality.
"the debate there is unstructured, it is some word fireworks that only substitute for a real solution of current problems" said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed during the idea of his book that his issue is very important for it, and that he commits itself to that so therefore.
He also expressed its satisfaction over the fact that his book appears in German translation because "I often at the caricatures of my views."
Now business prospects could therefore read its setting.
Klaus reminded that it was not klimatologe, but it has in his opinion sufficient conditions in order to write such a book.
It is finally academics, able to understand professional discussions and to judge, has experience with statistics and is also.
As a main statement of the book he referred to the thesis that the climate is changed continuously and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no to global warming matching opinion among the scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and, therefore, no threat represented and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate, superfluous, ineffective expensive and.
In addition he considers it as somebody who has experiences with totalitarian, unacceptable opinions on other ones, to impose he regards that as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
At present, when he said that he is not against "a reasonable environmental protection, however against militant who take no consideration on the relationship between expenditure and profit."
On the same issue in Vienna Klaus had already two months ago in the spoken.

Test Peugeot 207 1.6 1.6: voruteile fade
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving were not much value to refer to the quality of the control as well as the processing could one as rather designate below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, on the market and this is much better.
In combination with the designation sw is still go further and only remains for me to revise my opinion.
As I had tested the classical hatchback 207, I had to complain about the too low, for example on the rear seats.
There are now no longer these complaints, because the body combination is formed in such a way that not even suffer.
Fast further
I go by only in order not to repeat myself too very much.
It is a question of a quite succeeded design, where I have only because of the miserable central tunnel's objections.
There I would welcome a little more designerische organization, where the car makes otherwise a so elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past the times of where we too short seats or.
Even the side has fundamentally improved in comparison with the 206.
Regarding the space is concerned, you here can feel the increased dimensions of the body.
In the combination of already mentioned lack of head freedom.
Suitcase into the trunk
The main thing at this step forward is the back seats.
(The I must also because of the reverse window) as very well beladbar and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with safety belts which represent an ideal compromise.
You do not disturb can and hold even more difficult objects.
But, we talk about the drawer volume.
It is according to table in the basic equipment 428 compared to competition, which is a rather average value.
Not compared to the vehicle of this class, the? fabia.
If we take the 207 1.6 with the new generation of product from Mladá Boleslav compare, we find that the Peugeot around clearly perceptible 52.
For a foreign vacation or when inviting a buggy this value is already critical.
But in order to emphasize the positiva, I must have the loading space completely flat after turning the back seats or also mention the very low.
120 HP in four row
Our was with a petrol engine with capacity of 1.6 litres and an achievement of 88 kilowatts.
And frankly, it should have a look, which propels a family.
It is quiet, has a small consumption and attract good way.
When I compare it with its counterpart with? comparisons, which sometimes works as if its exhaust with a rag been blocked, then I can only be inspired by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not just national.
We must remember, however, that we have a well equipped car with a spacious innneren and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400th gasoline engine at the level of 329900 crowns still starts.
With our engine it costs from 410900 Crowns which is already quite a lot.
The equipment of the test car once again with 80000 crowns besides.
We had, however, bags automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper electrical window lifters behind and and...
So the car costs in total 531900 crowns settles.
That is a lot, but they expect the options of a fabia once and they will arrive with a very similar sum.
Therefore only the decision, which mark one vote.
Integration Slovakian student in britschen schools will not
In British schools the number of children from countries of Eastern Europe, which at the local ones for the further development of the local public education.
The integration of the east Europeans pushes up to now to a series of obstacles.
British schools find even cases where disputes between the immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants of violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe at britschen schools illustrates appropriate in the case of North Kent, where the conflict between local and gradually Slovak immigrants.
Quarrels, harassment and fights among pupils, relations between the parents.
The situation developed already so far that the police in a Slovakian woman who young with a ten-year had beaten.
The accused to emphatically that the young it with racist insults insulted.
The police had also an attack of two minor girls on a Slovakian immigrant intervention.
The girls were against the man supposedly racist remarks and made him with stones.
"when we went home, a young on a cottage and spat onto us.
As I said to him that he should stop, he us with apples and pears and then be described, "a mother Slovakian students of newspaper the another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals referred to the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe even as a survival fight.
The aforementioned cases testify that the atmosphere between local and immigrants at British schools is strained always.
In Great Britain 70000 Slovaks are self-employed, came to job hunting here.
Approximately 30000 Slovakian students attend accordingly British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is in fact an island of freedom.
What they expect from their holidays, that will be fulfilled if they choose the right thing to do.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea which is quiet as a pond.
And all of this with palms including at the beach offer pizza, ice and beguiling cocktails.
Kitesurfing, Gulf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you find that in measure.
Only on an island you find, however, still many more, and that is the island of Cuba, the largest and most beautiful great Antilles.
At present the Spaniard was Cuba their bastion of conquest America.
It called Columbus the most beautiful place saw each individual human eye.
Havana was once a warehouse or transit camp of value, which had stolen the Spaniards in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American period.
The hotel Nacional completely arose at the end of the 20th century.
Building left it one of the leaders of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was regarded as a crime in the USA (especially during the prohibition on Cuba), was most welcome and support - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Under his guests were among other things.
Winston Churchill, ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high-rise buildings increased, over the wide boulevards of car go which were part of the cult of the ritual among.
Ernest Hemingway bought a estate in San Francisco de Paula, near and he had in his yacht lie.
At the walls of the bodeguita del Medio star of the show business and politicians from the whole of America their signatures.
And today?
At the walls of the bodeguita of Havana, you too can leave behind your.
At the bar in the hotel Nacional it mixes cocktails very for it.
And the cult of the 1950s drive around in Havana until today because the imported once and Fiats in the and damp air fell apart a long time ago.
May Havana, in particular his oldest part heavily nowhere does it finds in so many colonial objects of interest here as straight.
Other places are just straight, for example Trinidad.
In relation to that of tourism brings urgently needed money, it was there for this development green light.
In the last fifteen years, not only new hotels in Havana, but also in varadero, at the coast of the province holguín and also on islets as cayo Coco, cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba is still a fad that is unique in the world, and above all railway lover.
Steam of remote and brought the railways to the sugar factories.
Their vehicle fleet was not renewed over decades, and so, is there and fully functioning locomotives, whose lengthen contemporary elsewhere in the museum.
Trip goals
The places the majority of visitors from Cuba.
It must also be about varadero Havana have to write or not.
It remains only to mention that in the already mentioned estate a museum, whose visit, writers, these measures should not be.
The viñales-valley in the west of the island of Cuba is one of the angles.
The luxurious vegetation increases to lime ground.
The mogotas, lime hill and rock, rise sharply from the valley, in their hollow fertile ground water through which also adopt by a thick.
It is this valley where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is built on.
In its final form, you can meet him if you visit one of the cigar factories.
Perhaps it seems to some also interesting that the Chilean consequence of the TV series "major Zeman" was turned.
Trinidad
An ancient city which shortly after the Spaniards had colonized the island has been established.
Brought fame and wealth of the trade with slave and sugar.
The fortune embodied itself in the beauty of the small city.
The Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed since four hundred years.
Trinidad between the sea and the is a sited remote place that there was still in the streets of the last century, not the area associated with the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to its remaining unseen.
Nothing was built down, however, therefore also anything any was happy that he had a roof over the head.
If more than one afternoon time for Trinidad has, then it is worth interesting places them in the environment, such as the beach playa ancón or the "valley of factories".
It should be at the Casa de la go following the darkness, and where the music not silent up to the morning.
Baracoa
This completely in the east than call on some of the most beautiful island.
Certainly this opinion is also by the way there.
Both the roads lead from Guantánamo there must overcome high and zerküftete mountains and run by a landscape, which is scarcely touched by human interventions.
UNESCO received this eastern outpost of Cuba, thanks to the pristine in its nature.
There the best chocolate is manufactured in the church, one shows the Cross of Columbus (in fact, it is about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus came into being, and from the hill, where the former castle, the present hotel El Castillo, are to be seen, several of which El yunque is the best known.
Over the coffee, the rum, which cigars, which Sierra, the Bay and the island Isla de pinos, about the heiligtum of the Cuban patron caridad del cobre about the santeria, an African religion of the descendants of slaves stand above all, one could write many sides.
However, as one says so, looking better with own eyes.

We have about Ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment that we need, and that is too little "de Hoop of the Agency Reuters said with regard to the end of talks with the Japanese Government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries involved in recent months, there is also dispute about whether all allies give their best in Afghanistan.
Because of passivity for example Germany.
"the Germans are relatively numerously represented in Afghanistan.
They are stationed in fields where there is only a modicum of violence, and not as high for them and for us in the southern and eastern part of the country, "said gates.
The British "sun" called this week the German soldiers rotten furs.
"Afghan nothing door unmasks: the German make plays while our boy fight", the "sun" in a contribution which was supplemented by photos of German soldiers who play.
The German picture newspaper proceeded with the counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit with a in the southern part of Afghanistan.

It sees Vladimír, analyst of the next finance: "to the excess of one trillion, we could, in the course of the year 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If it should be shown that the situation is changed on the political stage, and should be ready to save more, that could last up to the year 2010.
But I do not take such a change, "he recognized.
Debt grow
The national debt stems from the debts of the state government and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits of the national budget.
The national debt is financed through treasury, state financing, direct loans or for example through loans from the European Investment Bank.

It is interesting that the growth particularly with the bonds, where the increase is 20%.
It is bad that the debt rise, but on the other hand this shows that one can undertake something, already before pension reform comes ", the data.

From the financing strategy and the contact with the national debts for 2007 that the government had intended for this year billion Crowns.
At the beginning of December the lower, thanks to the better development of the state but the plan to 152.8 billion Crowns.
This amount stems from the state budget deficit that 76 billion Crowns obviously this year instead of the estimated 91,3 billion will achieve.
Further concerns it at most planned means for the consolidation agency in height of a billion Crowns for the payment of the pensions, the financing of 43 billion for and rates for the loans with the European Investment Bank in height of billions.
Of a given a name, it was presented for a court in Khartoum today.
After indicating their attorney, the British teacher in Sudan, the accused of insult of the Islam on Thursday evening, by a court in Khartoum to 15 days detention and following classification.
The Briton was accused, allowed to pupils six to seven year old to have, a Teddy bear to give the name, although any representation of the prophet is prohibited.
They would have deserved to be whipped.
After parents of pupils had complained repeatedly near the Sudanese Ministry of Education, the education and cultural in the unity high school of was active on Sunday with themselves at home and picked up to Article 125 of the Sudanese penal code of the insult of Islam.
In fact, this matter takes its beginning in September when the teacher their pupils six to seven year to contribute a name for the choice.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, Robert boules reports.
Finally, when the class co-ordinates 20 of 23 children of Mohammed choose as like first name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophets, but it is also a first name very frequent in Sudan.
Then the children a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on that and the caption is my name Mohammed.
The bear did not carry a label with this name, but the problem is simply that the representation of the Islamic prophet regarded as an insult of the Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, teaches Sudan at the same school, said that he knows it well, and she would never have something would have done, and to close a religious belief, I can only regret that she asked the children, a name to vote for his opinion is only a "innocent error.
An opinion that numerous pupils of the teacher of these as very attentive to their pupils and as a person, who never talks about religion in the class describe.
One considers that the first name Mohammed in Great Britain at is the most frequent given, for which in English 14 different exist.
This first name often selected by Moslem families is seen as a kind of respect at the prophet (it is frequently given a family holds).
But how do the rules in the reference to the use of this first name?
One must give it for example a toy?
This is naturally a matter of interpretation.

Three days before the Parliament choices, the Russian President Vladimir Putin an information broadcast on the public senders to the voters that already indeed was recorded, whose contents are however kept secret.
He does this as a leading candidate of United Russia, who, for which an overwhelming victory announces itself.
Yesterday the President looked through when he received the foreign ambassadors, and is happy, a new target against the Western powers, to provide the interference accused of its favourite topic during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest, extremely transparent and open elections, elections without trickery, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they there wasted.
It prangert one by suppression stained campaign.
The Communist leader günnadi ziouganov says, it would never have been such dirty choices, not even in the time of eltsin.
According to the suppression of the demonstrations at the last weekend, is valid for Garry for bad demonstrating to five days imprisonment, furthermore, according to his lawyer.
The Russians preserved the mentality of the Homo sovieticus
After these general elections without tension, two a lot continuing questions:
Who will succeeded as President Putin will?
The newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential elections yesterday, 2 March 2008; the candidates have time until 23 December to announce.
Because he was selected 2000 and 2004 were, Vladimir Putin, not for a third mandate in sequence.
And now is no successor.
What role will play Putin after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the majority in Parliament and the all-powerful party United Russia, the government and President will select?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary and presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
That is tradition.
The Russians the mentality of the Homo sovieticus, they are not wishing to their fate, mean the sociologist lev director of the independent Center levada.
The historian Nikolai from the State University St. Petersburg goes back even still further: the civil society, in this country which five centuries to Europe, only very slowly; the famous esprit de corps delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the nineties Putin connected to the model of a paternalistic state, which was completely accepted by the population, all the more because on this new paternalism no terror followed, but a certain economic prosperity, Maria lipman means of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians renounce "voluntarily with the personal responsibility which they after the collapse of the USSR on a short-term basis laid by the day.
To which still long held over?
This phenomenon affects all social classes, including the business world.
And the administration understands it, to hold the status quo: 65 (governors of 85 Russian region chairpersons) lead the local lists of the United Russia.
The new, coming from the West freedoms are often tantamount to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara tcherednitchenko, a 54-year Professor: to which still for a long time?
Those powers are not so bad, why they pay off?

Banif believes that in that statistically considers the month of December at the stock exchange, usually with a positive market trend changed
Nonetheless it is not advisable, short-term projections, and only on the basis of statistics, particularly then not, when developing the current market event tensions
Although other experts to such a strong in the last weeks of the year, not approve nevertheless these say that the market prices from the liquidity of the market and the market participants will invest this is due to the lack of safe in a pension fund, which mainly by the revaluation-running trend towards net assets is greatly concerned.
Therefore according to expert opinion that the stock exchange rather a rather, influenced from market fluctuations, particularly because we have not the scales of the possible drop of the interest rate of the US can assess a uncertainty, above all to the increased and the danger of the rise of the large inflation is.
Javier barrio, chairperson of the sales at bpi in Spain, agrees with the fact that it is a risky time to announce a forthcoming market rally.
The chances do not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish share index, for its maximum mark on 8 November of points lost a value of 4%.
But not all experts divide the same negative opinion.
According to opinion of Juan Solana analyst could, in the ibex 35 due to the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional, carried out every year around this time, the year of the pension fund successfully with nearly 16,000 points.

Five times in seven years
In the last seven years December showed only in two cases sinking course courses.
When at the end of 2003 the burst this led the stock exchange from their crisis and initiated at the same time the last real.
This year in which the ibex 35 by 28,17 percentage points of December, a course of 6,68%.

Popular will its 200 credit institutions of on Mondays and Fridays have 12 hours in the day.
Popular decided on a large part of its branches modernize.
Overall 200 of them are in the economy strongest regions of Spain.
For the institute that operates under the brand name popular Max these subsidiaries mean a big milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institute, as popular as a first name is the leap lengthen the opening hours of its branches and on Saturdays to extend to apply from.
The, also the prolongation of their opening times in the addresses repeated reads, has made no definitive decision.
The current negotiations of the Bank with the unions, seem to aim at an agreement on the 75% of all branches are closed on Saturdays and on a weekday open up this afternoon, if not the custom.
Whether other banks of the new initiative, for the opening times, will depend on the empirical values of the popular bank.
And just that is also the intention, which pursues popular with its project.
The goal is to extend the opening times of those branches of their situation, the custom of independent, small and located centrally enterprises inclined to buy, but also the cause of large department stores.
The bank wants new 200 branches in the course of the coming 18 months, because they are not new, but opening times are changing.
For that the Bank will acquire make the premises of those which are already in business, and they adjust to the individual customer profile of the different zones simultaneously.
So the enlargement of the opening times with a new room organization of the branches, compounded by a more current, characterised colorful design.
The responsible representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require any greater investments, but would be accompanied by an increased personnel attitude since a branch now no longer six, but eight or nine employees needed.
The acquire even equipped with additional premises for the SMEs will be will not sell any financial products.
A positive experience for the Group
Popular already at nine branches in Madrid tested.
And the empirical values turned out positively, according to.
The subsidiaries of the streets Bravo murillo, O ´ and grain were selected for that, which appears to have been a clever resolve.
Popular currently guides. 2500 subsidiaries.
And another 60, which operate under the name and specialize in immigrants and have expanded opening hours as well, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of the model of the bbva not used as most of them instead for a wide choice for the sale of non procedure.
We would not like to represent any competition for our customers, declared Rivero.
With Telefonica they came preliminary to the agreement of external aid to sell mobile telephones.
The Spanish private station Telecinco doubled for the first time an outdated agricultural market value and thus its rival antena 3.
We created it.
With this sentence of the executive director, Paolo Vasile, with satisfaction, his views the sender guided by it had its value by double its rivals, 3.
One aspect, however, subdued his joy: this is exactly what violated; not me is that we have a higher growth, but that we had smaller losses, he stated.
He stressed that they, despite the weak market is not sink deep.
Telecinco ended yesterday the day with a positive balance of 2.54%.
This profit reduces his previous losses of this year on 15,66%.
According to information of Bloomberg reaches now 4.488,88 million euro Mediaset, with the main part of the capital (52%), controlled and vocento is involved only with 13%.

The market value of other stock market; on the other hand, in the case of sogecable on 3.571 million, at prisa (editor of the magazine días) on 2.518,53 million and at vocento on 1.779 million.
The comparison with 3 can be derived from the fact that it is a question of two similar enterprises Vasile, for example.
Uncertain, nor the question to what extent we are in fact at what price and how we can make on customer.
Telecinco declared a week, his intention this year to the first television networks, with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising ago this motorist. Tringali, the executive director of the insured and the group.
If the project should be converted to the sender his in comparison with the 965,4 million from the previous% increase for advertising.
In the case of the 3, by 1.6% in the first nine months (up to 734,4 million), while the net income from which only a rise of 0.7% (630,4 million) could have.
The main factor for the better in the comparison, or of the high payout reason, that the company could show up to the present time: in 2006, as well as the enterprise guided by Alejandro a 100-prozentige.
Uninsured Vasile, however, that the reason for the purchase of 33% of the parts of final moles, with media set as a holding company, nor could vary, even if it is still too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged to the official compromise at least 50% of the shares, even if we have to pay up to now always fundamentally stated more.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year we whose shares the purchase of 33% of the final were already able to increase.

Bono declares itself, but the candidacy of the PSOE and, in the case of a choice victory, in Congress.
The former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, will he PSOE candidates on the list of the forthcoming general cite in Toledo and, in the case of a choice victory of the Socialists, the office of the.
So it of José Blanco, of the PSOE and Bono in the press conference, having announced today in the headquarters of the party was a meeting with Zapatero.
In the view of the leaders of the offer to the former Minister justified since it is important in the politics to be able to count on the best and Bono among the best.
Moreover, coming from the Mancha politicians in the case of a victory for the Socialists at the next elections according to all appearance as chairman of the Congress for the party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as a, which was announced on the last 15 November at the next general, no longer his career to the public policies and in the end, university area for the climate protection.
The former Minister had to admit that the two years since his resignation continuously on his return to the political event had insisted.
Moreover, he pointed out that the party, such as the appointment of the Vice-President for economy, the citizens, who do not want councils in the case of a choice victory would the post of the lead, and referred to this as an act of transparency.
If it should take over the office in fact, he hopes so the Chamber in a House of respect and not the insult or the action to make them so increasingly more similar to the citizens to appear.
Unfortunately one gains from time to time the impression as if the only place in Madrid, in which one can speak not quietly and neglected the Congress; it was in the Senate once up to 26 times interrupted.
At the same time, he has praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and pointed out that he does not want to raise the appearance already have taken over the Presidency, because otherwise his political opponents would refer to this as arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since the both the sceptics of the climate change and those that put a social and political debate in the face of a merciless criticism, the unterzieht movement as a whole a strong cohesion on the day.
Especially when it is a question of a chief of the movement, which, as in the case of the government Zapatero, the fight against climate change is more important than the fight of the Islamic terrorism and even suggests a new contract with the planet to a conclusion.
This proposal brings it, however, in a declaration concerning the action, or of his government which has contributed decisively to that Spain within the EU at the top of the countries is that the guidelines of the least fulfilled.
Who are the persons responsible for the non-fulfilment of handicaps, to which sectors is this, and his government that the contract with the planet had proposed not stop this development.
In addition it is now forced, the Spanish citizens of which measures against him to explain the climate change without beating around.
Which companies will be affected by the citizens, which is supposed to be changed, which individual and collective economy measures must be carried out and what economic consequences result from that.
More specifically, the victims, and who must pay for saving the planet.
However, it has and there will be no such explanations in the future.
Just because it is a question of the sacrificing and the payment is concerned.
Because the measures against climate change, which can really be used are unpopular.
They are uncomfortable and alarming for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the proposed by the PSOE appeared seen Zapatero so dangerous that he saw forced to take back the proposal again.
Accordingly, now, the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise so suitable for campaigns politicians talk neither, still accuse, still want instead follow the exacting output and decorate meetings with his this kindness to inspire and others.
But this can only be done if the Treaty does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and thus does not claim that the bicycle future to the only progressive movement or we will only with a fan may.

What insurance is suitable for me the best?
The insurance that a possible claim caused by the driver, covers contains a high cost whose height of depends on different factors, and other of age, sex, time of the creation of the driver's type of car which can be insured and its use, and so forth.
To own a car is only the beginning.
After all, it is even more difficult to find the suitable insurance as the correct vehicle model.
First, it must be clear to one with what we have to do it here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an assurance company and an insured.
This agreement will be held in writing by means of an versicherungsvertrags damage that society receives and return to a claim is that the appropriate sum paid in compensation.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance, consists through several factors, and other age, sex, time of the creation of the driver's type of vehicle which can be insured or its use.
The insurance companies and set their prices according to the statistics so that with a higher danger of accident also higher payments are due.
For this reason both via women less contribution payments achieve, because statistics prove that these groups, thanks to their caution have a smaller accident rate.
The same is true for married persons, as this according to statement of the statistical values and therefore also after conviction of the enterprises to fewer accidents tend as singles.
The benefits, is attributed to the vehicle influences the frequency of the driving and thus also the probability of an accident.
As the use, the more probably the damage.
At the installation of the premium insurance must consider a whole series of points.
For this reason also the driver must study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance which meet its personal needs earliest.
We do this is the most important points that one with the selection of an insurance should take into account not only to performance, but also a price oriented choice to make.
The less than 25-year meetings with the choice of a low-priced insurance in numerous obstacles, such as low and the "young" driving licence.
Even if it is an ideal coverage for the risks to a conclusion, there are nevertheless more inexpensive alternatives.
The cautious drivers can select a full hull with, so that the achievements of an covered, but indeed offered at a low price.
This kind of contract contains that the customer a part of the amount resulted from the damage must pay.
The amount is before the end of the contract and by means of the levels of a higher premium is ever smaller the sum to be Luis Noguera explains main agent of Spain with, one for Europe.
Another option is not the enlarged insurance, the customer against external damages, however, against the harm arisen at the own car.
Furthermore, this kind of the insurance theft, fire and vehicle loss.
A Council.
If you are less than 25 years old, it suits in your hand to lower the cost of insurance; so your credit increases itself when trying to drive, and to avoid accidents.
A credit is a lowering of the base rate in the corresponding assurance company.
For this purpose a payment on an increase of said rate.
The height of credits and punishment payments are linked to society and its returns.
If it has a rich year behind it, can be taken the liberty, to increase explains.
As soon as the exceeded, it is easier for drivers to sign a contract. Reason for this is the fact that with increasing the accident rate sinks.
Thus it is most reasonable for deciding with a full deduction.
Usually the young people can not profit from their previous experience no, both in the case of an accident and at the time of driving not, describe the Spanish of the European enterprise, and adds, that the majority of the accidents in the second, after the fear of beginner "was put down.
Nevertheless it is with a married customer, who does not possess children, a full; only then does, of course, if the financial situation of the person concerned also approves.
On the part of married couples with children are regarded as the customers with the least accident rate, and correspondingly low also their contribution payments.
In this case, would be a full comprehensive insurance with (with an amount for the 300 Euros) the best option which you will receive a high credit, is recommended an extended insurance, only for the third year.
You go more loosely in total and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to a higher contribution payment determine Luis Noguera.
It is good for pensioners, with a full deduction (with an amount around 150), the euro or an enlarged insurance which does only with a sufficiently high credit.
Finally one must observe that the car insurance something very important not only because it protects the driver against possible, but also because it contains high costs require it, that a thorough choice is made, which corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes on the point in Milan round of the

New fears about natural between Russia and Ukraine
A new price quarrel between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the danger that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe.
The largest part of the Russian natural in the European Union (EU) is led by the Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is observed very exactly.
Kiev has warned that if the price that Moscow it must pay for the natural gas from Russia, there are higher transit fees into account will put.
A former conflict between the two states in the last year reduced deliveries into the EU.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow happens at a time at which the Ukrainian Government and the Russian State Gazprom, try to achieve an agreement how much in terms of Russian natural gas in the year 2008 pay.
According to Gazprom more must be charged Ukraine, because the company agreed up to 50% for natural gas from the neighbouring Turkmenistan to pay.
Say that this could mean that Ukraine 40% more for the imports of Gazprom pay.
It is important for us, our arguments as one of the most important to use in talks, said the Minister of economics of the Ukraine the news agency Reuters.
"The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly with our arguments concerning the height of the transit charges [to] about the Western Ukraine."
In the last great natural between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 Gazprom shortened deliveries in Ukraine.
This led to consequence for a case of exports to Western Europe, which pushed up the prices drastically.
Russian gas, a quarter of the supply of the European Union.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but a lot of that remains underdeveloped.
The consequence is that Gazprom his own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.

It added that the Scottish Government, in connection with the health authorities into account, the recommendations of the report and would guarantee that the best practices in updated guidelines concerning the control investigations in the employment of all employees again - including those from abroad - whose publication is planned next month.

The climate on the Venus might be a view on the future of the earth reveal
The Venus was maybe once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data on European contained an orbit show that the planet Earth a twin resembles more aware than hitherto.
Venus is the sewing Estonian planetary earth.
The two worlds have roughly the same size and have similar planet courses, however the Venus of the sun is a little closer.
Before billions of years would have been there on the Venus' conditions, very similar to those on earth would have been and could have been even inhabitable scientists believe today.
But because of the erosion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower's Venus, a quite different one.
Today the planet of water is robbed and has a surface temperature which is enough, lead to melt and ravaged by and flash storms.
The findings of the space probe Venus express the European space travel agency, which planned for one year examined, offer a view of how the earth in view of the catastrophic climatic changes could develop.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Department physics at the Oxford University, one of the scale of the Venus express mission, said: "It is clear why the climate on the Venus so different to that of the earth, while the planet are being quite similar."
"our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which the Venus before billions of years as the earth has begun, possibly with a environment."
"enriched uranium" confiscated by the police

Everything still open
Memo romey said, it does not consider worthy of a presidential candidate from a to be consulted.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the Presidency, ultimately, willing to place itself to a debate on the questions, in ordinary voters video questions and hand in order to send it to the candidate.
None of the questions that on the Wednesday evening, the 28 November, were raised, as ridiculous as the snowman the democrats, about the global warming in the debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected this time is the state of the Republican Party which opens in the elections next year is open.
It is not known, just as the producers of CNN, the debate, the selected the candidates to selected the beginning.
Yet in the first half hour of debate, the longest the a single issue was dedicated, immigration stood in the heart.
The issue is one of the strongest topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked to manipulate a group of voters to operate a if they heard things that they liked: the television noticed points of the agreement as the candidates talked about the borders severely.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between rudy Giuliani, the national forerunner, and romney of in the decisive inquiries in Hampshire and new pushed forward.
Giuliani attempts to shake off the call that he was soft with regard to illegal immigration, when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked romney in that it the former governor of Massachusetts accused of illegal immigrants for working on its House.
The two stopped especially hard as interrogators asked whether one of the candidates a "Amnesty" (illegal a regular status and the way to the citizen would be) would support.
More insignificant candidates as Duncan hunter, a representative, and Tom tancredo, a representative from Colorado, in with this topic.
Neither of the two men have serious chance during the nomination, but both stay in the running, maybe because sooner and harder than others on the immigration bass drum.
At least in the field of immigration, the candidates and the same opinions: sharper borders, intolerance illegal migrants.
This issue, together with fears about poisonous toy from China or other worries about the rest of the world to help the republicans differences between the liberal Conservatives and Christian or to minimize the least.
But the debate was clearly problematic as other topics for the language.
Mr Giuliani was asked, why he supported in the past.
John McCain and romney discussed about whether drowning should be regarded as torture.
One of the interrogators asked whether the candidates every word of the Bible.
This Giuliani representing the point of view that although the Bible is his preferred book, it the history of jonah and perhaps literally did not believe the whale.
A further question regulator asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
MIKE huckabee - now towards all expectations in the first place in an inquiry recently carried out in thanks to his Christian conservatism existing for a long time - said that the death penalty is painful, but necessary.
When he was pushed on whether Jesus would approve it, he said about Jesus was too intelligent in order to apply for a political office.
The racing remains open extraordinarily.
Huckabees rise in comes together with Paul's recent and its in the debate of Wednesday.
These two are out of nothing, because the two wings of the party up to now not yet on one of the better known and more traditional candidates of some could.
In 1980 and 2000 a candidate from the beginning and convincing together with a victorious message about the size of America and a to both wing of the party.
This time the party divided, and the result is not at all clear.
The labour pains
Gordon Brown has yet another pit for falling; its way from this remains the same.
For British scandals this is not especially slippery.
No nobility, sold, Parisian pays no politician, hotel bills have no toes.
But the revelation that a rich businessman ruling for the British Labour Party on more than 650.000 pounds (1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people disguised, and that the party failed to announce this is something without the fought Gordon Brown good would have managed.
When two months ago the Prime Minister of the demand for an election had escaped from on stupid way the intelligence of the British offensive, when he said that opinion polls would not have influenced this decision there was hope that it would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, such as vince, increasingly astute agency chairmen of the Liberal Democrats, it expressed, the former brown from Stalin to Mr. bean.
The awkward rescue of northern rock, a bank, struggling weakness and bad discernment pointed under attack.
Badly thought out proposals to change the tax set against the government applied.
The loss of personal data of 25 million people demonstrated inconceivable administrative.
A trio of generals in the retirement started a revolt in the House of Lords in protest against shortening of military expenditure: to be Minister of the armed forces, so they have claimed, was a is.
Now there are the diverse donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, labours Secretary-General (and their former fulfilment leader) already resigned.
This means that brown breaks direction open.
Nevertheless governments can reach a turning point to which they feel impossibly to govern.
Neither like still people trust in politicians, but do they normally hold back their scepticism when a new force takes the office.
If it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister to improve the situation, and he does not even for a long time, this delay is past: the public service begins to become leaky; the cabinet ministers to start; the press looks for bad news; and the defensive and aimless.
In a way the position of brown particularly difficult, because he compared to other political leaders can not claim to be a new broom.
So with pleasure it Tony Blair would deny, he was.
The problems with northern rock and the issue of, for example, together with decisions that brown made as a Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even if not directly involved in Blairs of misfortunes - as in the case of the "money for nobility" of political party financing - may go to the voters that he was.
In spite of that situation is not quite as bad as it looks
The misdemeanours are not so terrible as the Conservatives describe it.
As with Mr. bean, nobody died, or was entirely cheated.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to be delivered, which of course Stalinist promised tendencies always: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new fuss about political contributions is a good example.
The garboeske Abrahams, which compares his donations with his non-profit gifts, says he wants no public recognition for his goodwill.
That may be so, but the decision was not about him.
The laws against anonymity for major political contributors are clear and they exist for an unequivocal reason: the public has a right to know who is to have access to which rule over the country can be bought.
Watts says he would have known about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, some questions must, of course, exactly as labours main finance recoverer the about the strange donations in October was told.
But so far Brown is not involved: there is nothing, that it indicates that he knew about this confusion, even though the largest part of the payments made after his taking office in June.
Up to now the Prime Minister finished half of the work.
He has fast violation of legislation by his party, but it diluted this determination by reaching for a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry to the topic - led, in order to make the measure full of a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, "this is not to be pulled out very complicated.
If the law was broken, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown must do something, as a permanent chairman for the independent committee for standards in public life that has been vacant for six months and to advance with a drastic reform of political party financing.
That would require from the hardliners of labour to co-operate with the Conservatives and possibly in the special financial relationship with the trade unions - which bitter pills for a party comrade as Mr Brown.
But it should be conscious of some partial facts.
The Conservatives have now a clear leadership in the opinion polls; it has two years to recover and voters; the only way it can achieve a victory is through incontestable honesty and sound competence.
Card sharks
Does the credit to the Americas?
If blood is in the water, it is only natural that dorsal fins spin annoyed.
Now the property market, where America's ailing the predators in the of the country.
Analysts of goldman reckon that the kreditkartenverluste 99 billion could achieve if the danger of infection of credit to other forms of credits.
Signs of the strain are clearly visible.
There are rises both with the writing off and that the measure the part of the credits which not individually retractable way or more than 30 days are too late.
The hsbc announced last month that they are a 1.4 billion dollar collection of charges from their American financing partial because of the weakness of credit card takers.
Nevertheless it is too early to lapse into panic.
Losses and delays are still low.
According to the rating of 3.89% was almost a full percent under the historical average.
The deterioration with the rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American one in 2005 led to an abrupt case of in turn for a large portion of the offers us; the number of registration (and in this way would rise again), whether the general conditions for deteriorate borrowers or not.
The industry also reports of solid which show how much of their debt consumers every month
And the confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, in spite of the standstill in other corners of the structured funding.

British bänker plead guilty in the Enron case
Three British bankers, for their role in the fraudulent system with the former main Andrew of Enron, should be put in court on Wednesday, changing their requests in guilty.
David bermingham, Giles darby and Gary mulgrew had originally for seven cases of fraud by use of for the alleged with fastow in a secret finance fraud in the year 2000 in order at the expense of their employer pleads on innocent.
The procedures had been applied on January.
But during a hearing in court in front of Ewing junior everyone pleaded for a case of fraud using telecommunications means.
The three former managers of Greenwich natwest, a unit of the Royal bank of Scotland group plc, were in Great Britain in the course of delivery procedures which lasted two years overdue.
In the United States their case is a loose end of an investigation, which was started after Enrons breakdown in 2001.
The accusations originally submitted against them in the year 2002 made fastow that he shares the objective of an investigation of the government in connection with the Enron fall.
The accusation against the bankers - mentioned the three "- claimed that they are in the year 2000 to Houston about one fraudulent plot with fastow and his former top consultant Michael kopper hatch.
In a subsidiary Greenwich natwest had invested a partnership of Enron controlled by fastow, was the architect of innumerable fraudulent was which contributed to tear the company in bankruptcy-wobble.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank the value of their participation in the subsidiary estimated to zero, but the three British men knew that she had considerable value in reality.
An enterprise under koppers control acquired the parts of the Bank of the subsidiary of 1 million dollars.
The bankers paid kopper 250,000 dollars for a participation in this enterprise.
According to the accusation, wrongly, that opposite Enron the energy companies 20 million dollars natwest for their parts of the subsidiary numbers.
But in fact 20 million dollars went to the British bankers, fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million, while fastow, kopper and other about 12.3 million dollars, according to the accusation.
In January 2004 admitted itself in two charges on conspiracy for his role in the Enrons bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow sits out a term of imprisonment in the achievements of Louisiana.
Kopper serve a punishment of three years and a month in an equipment in texarkana.
Each of the three men was on free foot due to a 1 million bail, which made it necessary that it was the United States lived in expectation of the legal proceedings.
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest enterprise, crumbled in the bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of bookkeeping tricks not disguise the billion debts longer or action, make profitable.
The breakdown destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
The Enron founder Kenneth lay and the former one executive Jeffrey skilling last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling serve a punishment of more than 24 years.
Lays condemnation for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were futile, after he last year because of heart illness.

Soon, there was a.
And then a further one was there.
And then I saw the medical coroner approaching, said livingston, a supervisor of the restaurants, on Wednesday.

The behören found out that the dead Ms Olga Arroyo, 41, was, an assistant of the director of the Newark police department.

Peevish markets in a clear effort, to reassure the light of sign of rising credit said the recent turbulence would have "part of some of the improvements of the late part of September and October."
If the increased turbulence should stay, they would have the possibility of a further intensification of the financial conditions for consumers and enterprises, he said.
The comments were picked up by investors as a signal that the Central Bank is ready to intervene and with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further reductions of the rate of interest to stabilize the conditions.
The remarks helped to reassure the Wall Street, faced with further bad news from the US economy, now since the sales of us real estates achieved a new record depression in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil, of the announcement of bear stearns, the they highlighted that 650 jobs, or 4% of their global workers, in a measure for the cost reduction, to eliminate serious losses from their lost bets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 will disappear from these places in London, where the bank employees Member.

England confronted with decision on the statements of owais Shah and
Here two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the others.
Who as number 6 for England in kandy at this weekend, owais Shah, or ravi?
And, not less relevant in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is supposed to make the decision?
The second question is important, because the David youthful, on call at least under this specific title, here is the Peter bog and captain Michael Vaughan to help to determine and because the table of high morries, the English gradually managing director, with applications for national voter pews when not even for which in partial time.
Whoever does not get the sixth will be unfortunate, but the life is often unfair and the sport, it is beyond doubt.
It is never easy to nail exactly what a human being to reach the top of his while someone else about the lowest rank sometimes for lack of luck instead of capacity.
It is not only in the cricket where it is needed, where difficult judgments are always at the end subjective.
It is the correct time for, from?
It is fair to Shah if he does it?
The same can, in a further area may also be asked whether, for example, John Edward "or", both intelligent young managers with good ends, know the business well should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class for a one-day, unless, he will have the possibility to swim or to go down.
As a matter of course numbers have a great influence on decisions, but also have this chance.
Within a team a one-day must the eye of the captain at the right time, start if he can take a wicket and a regular opportunities must be in order, if he wants to do impression as a one-day.
The eyes of the catch is too complicated.
There were many who better in the last season than, for example, as James Anderson, seemingly in the first test will play, even if Stephen pronounces itself and for known as the wind into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with each 33 runs in order to earn a position in this tour.
Chris tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but they both had their highlights and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or, in the asgiriya stadium, can only play a question.
The choice could decide on the careers of both men, or, perhaps, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka played Gareth batty in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, it was, however, Paul, then still fightingly, in order to consolidate the break-through to an important testkricketspieler abolished and that, although it is a double hundred against Australia in Australia, perhaps still is underestimated.
It is probable that youthful Vaughan and bog, after a further discussion in the course of today's in the asgiriya stage their conservative instincts and for shahs greater experience about net enthusiasm will follow.
There are arguments for both of them.
For Shah speaks his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds, and only six of the seven years younger with 22 years, and an excellent balance against bullets.
But Shah made only ten runs in its two innings in the may against West in the test in Lord, its as a player from middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection of the devices as Vaughan was known for his position for the next game, the momentum from its defeat seems to have taken the was still manifest in Bombay.
In contrast, the Jack of all trades from Essex Essex.
He has nothing to a impressed and its attitude off of it was perhaps when he recently with a vehicle in an exhibition for England sponsor Volkswagen had estimated.
He suffered smaller injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was his Vodafone (, of course, also gesponsort) to get out and ask its Cook, which had observed this from the distance, and eagerly to say: "You saw that did?".
, is a much better, he his here with some impact on the grounds, what it seems to match and tolls with confidence and fate.
The right man to vote is one thing, to choose the correct time another.
Perhaps that is the actual art of choice.
I now its opportunity for this purpose, which does not mean that Shah well, but perhaps not chef if, as the from Ceylon suggests, it is that that will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first bus Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of refugees, whose resources or visas ran out, and the other, hoped that the city to normality returning.
Some have even come back around the rebels, it from their homes.
Busily still before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen penalties, was active to terminal with fugitives from Syria and Jordan had returned in private.
"I decided to go to Syria, after they had killed many doctors in Baghdad, said Sabah al-qubaisi Sunni, a doctor.
"I returned today, because of what I have seen on television and which I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad and as it would be now secure."
You say that of course stopped killing people ", he said, with respect to the Shiite of militant clergyman addr, arranged its forces back to the present time.
Qassim Al atwani, a 38-year old Shi'ite teachers from the overwhelming Sunni part of returned with his two children, because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime does not allow Iraqi work.
Its Shia neighbours in amariyah called it, in order to say to him that a militia local, supported by the USA helped out of Al-Qaida bastion in the west of the capital, and insisted it for the return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni, Shia who from its house in sleikh include in the north by an attack with grenades was expelled, after he had requested its fellow citizens for fight.
He returns in order to fight.
"two days ago some of my friends called me and told me that they all the militia in sleikh and that they took my support and that of my young.
That is why I returned today, said, 62..
Many told that by the growing since the rest in the capital and the growth of local "groups affected citizens", which had been attracted arms and in cooperation with the American military their boroughs.
But, more languages home money by visa problems and conversion to be forced, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in the last years.
Salaam al-samarrai, a 51-year father, expressed the general suspicion among the threefold that Shiite Prime Minister had requested that the Syrian Government to impose visa limits for the refugees to return to force people to.
More than two and a half million people are likely to be of the sectarian death fled the country.
"We were fine until al-Maliki Syria, and the government has pushed to the Iraqis no more visas, to return to Iraq to force" said the Sunni pensioners.
"I can not trust a government supports the criminals, the House burned down after I went away."
A part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunni, Shia and expelled from residential areas, which led to the creation of many places where tensions decreased.
There are fears that a sudden influx of displaced people, tensions will stir up again and come to conflict.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest state is leading with the job training and shine even with the international orientation of its nature.
Only in an education which expresses the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I have 'yesterday to the 50th time, that we are not French - the smallest state placards this slogan ironically to its 50th birthday.
In this case France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland the of the Institute of the German economy Cologne (iw) on place five.
So the colleges co-operate already from tradition countries closely.
The university in Saarbrücken was set up in 1948 of the French.
Until now, lock here their study with a double or even close.
The part is correspondingly high foreign studying with 15.6 per cent.
But also the Saarland brings the onto the colleges in number above average - many of them without an end at grammar school.
"in Saarland one uses the professional education" expert, says at the iw.
More than every fifth young person acquires its study authorization at a vocational school, this increase is more than seven percentage points over the.
Even the possibilities of vocational and academic training are comparatively fully developed.
On the total population the equipment with dual courses of studies which is based in Germany.
In spite of the practical training and increasing demand the number of the engineer in recent years, however, around a third have declined.
For that the ministry engaged the universities now to a marketing campaign for fan.
"at the general education schools after the Pisa study we first activated a few reforms says", a speaker of the Ministry of Education.
So the Government introduced national benchmark tests.
In this way the children to begin formerly to learn is the last kita year free of charge, a model that meanwhile also other Federal States copy.
If the services of the pupils improve development will show, only future comparative studies.
In PISA 2003 the part of the risk of 29 to 20%.
Altogether the Saarland did not however increase as strongly as other States.
The Bavarians calculate better.
And the anger at the are not measured - in this area, one could otherwise.
Because the language of the neighbours is at grammar schools - even if the French are not.
Chávez rearranges the clocks
In Venezuela the clocks tick soon differently than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez has the in the South American country turned back by a half hour.
Meanwhile in Spain Chávez becomes the joke figure.
As the Gazette of Venezuela informed, according to a new law the clocks on the world time minus four and a half hours.
In this way the südamerikansiche State gets a time zone which in any other country of the world.
The USA hostile Chávez justified its decision among other things with the United States in the world the organization into time imposed to full hours.

With the reform would clearly develop his power in the country.
The release of the argument was like a decision to extract the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, when it comes to the release of hostages.
Uribe Venezuela with his decision into the face, Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
Also in Spain is Chávez in all of it.
A new mobile phone-klingelton provides in the country for sensation: "por qué no te callas bell" (why you do not keep quiet) is the sentence which already more than half a million people downloaded from the Internet.
Spain has spoken him King Juan Carlos at the irritated by the constant interruptions iberoamerika-peak was and had gone to this over the mouth.
German threatens 2007 wage minuses
In spite of the strong economy threatens a prediction German workers according to this year.
Experts named a whole bundle of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation of the hans-böckler-donation workers may 2007 with less in real terms in the account than in the previous year.
"even the modest wage development, the tax increase and the with food and energy, said Gustav Horn Institute for macroeconomics and of the" Bild "newspaper.
New burdens could also come up with the unemployment insurance to employees.
Chancellor said "peer Steinbrück Osnabrücker newspaper", the planned for the insurance on 3.3% to the turn of the year is right, in the current situation and reasonable.
But for work must not happen again in embarrassment with the Federation for credits or subsidies, to have to ask the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it had become known that the price explosion in nahrungsmitteln and the inflation rate at the highest levels, since 13 years.

Venus is the twin of earth
The Venus, despite their anti-life atmosphere of the earth of similar than up to now thought: the European space probe "Venus express" has flashes in the atmosphere and discovers in Poland, as they arise in the winter also on earth.
Since almost three decades of scientists suggest that there is on the Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus express" produced the proof - it sought out electromagnetic waves on the fringe of the atmosphere: the flashes on the Venus fire at a value of approximately 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud Christopher, reports from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "nature".
According to the famous "ursuppen-theorie" flashes life on earth develop: thunderstorms should have stimulated in the ocean reactions that led to the formation of amino acids, the elements of life.
Not so on the Venus: "if there were ever lives there, it must have been in the very early history", Sean Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington.
Today, it is on the surface of the Venus little live: the atmosphere is about a hundred times more closely than on earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus is perhaps the of the earth, but it is a twin", said russel.
Why the Venus, the earth in mass and size so similar, such a completely different development, is the basic question.
The start of "Venus express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research as, since the beginning of the nineties no probe more particularly for the study of this planet was under way.
The most recent research results now in several "nature" are presented to underline in the view of the researchers, not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"You also show that in parallel with the earth is larger than initially accepted" the ESA informs.
For example, next to the already known whirlwind researchers at the North Pole also at a, it is still far more quickly.
The phenomenon reminds air currents on the earthly winter hemisphere to a group piccioni of the Italian Istituto Giuseppe Di astrofisica spaziale e hemisphere.
The second innermost planet of the solar system is almost the same as the earth is excessive and with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers almost as large.
Also as a or the planet referred circles in scarcely 225 days around the sun.
But he concerns a lot slowly themselves: a will take 243 earth.
Although the Venus with of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar scarcely on the earth scientists assume that both planet had arisen under very similar conditions.
On both water that remained on the earth in oceans, on which Venus but lost into the area.
And while while on earth in carbonate rocks on the Venus, does the majority of the atmosphere.

In the realm of Angela cloud
The unrealistic appearance of the Chancellor documents that with regard to the contents of the coalition is at the end of it - and that nothing is more to expect.
In which country does this Federal Chancellor actually?
After their hopeless appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag and meaningless, one must say: not here - not in the country that would have to be governed by it at last.
The accusation that it concentrates too much on the foreign policy, Angela Merkel, with a badly arrogant sentence rejected.
That is provincial, she said, and thus showed first that it does not want to understand, for it is a matter for the critics.
In Parliament it has been documented for all visible as their accusation is very true.
Neither concrete interest was present nor to feel a sense of the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela cloud presented itself: a removed politician who in the foreign policy and even there in the approximate.
Example climate protection: there it praises without brakes for the resolutions of holy dam but does not say how parts climatic goals are to be achieved.
Anyway, the self-praise - so much had presumptuousness still two years ago.
Now she clings to the empty phrase that the upswing arrives at the people.
It damages its image as a pragmatist, solve the problems instead of talking the world beautifully.
But in the realm of Angela cloud an edge appearance domestic problems.
Child poverty and the concerns of the low earners?
She has a few subordinate clauses for.
It is characteristic how often it promises when it came to the children.
She needs three approaches there in order to bring out a sentence straight.
She stumbles as on foreign terrain if it becomes concrete.

Richard is simply not cynical enough
With "the party" and "murderous peace" two films deal again with Balkan war.
But both do not.
Either the concepts set too much on action and geballer or however they are too sentimental.
There also Richard in "the hunting party did not help.
The good news first, while the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic hide still in the mountains of the Balkans, but right there, in the dark hinterland of, now the actors, Richard have found again.
We had the most beautiful man in the last years from the eyes, because in all too many kind unimportant roles for women and all too many press conferences drove Buddhism is the desire to issue a on seeing.
Now, Richard suddenly the most important argument, "the party - when the hunter to the will gejagten (why must be today actually always so long and confused as train them, perhaps, but?).
It provides a perfect representation: after his Simon what could have become from, if the fate and the reporter were not so benevolent: a man, of its very best times has long behind it but himself as a monument his decline is preserved considerable residues of the former charm.
But in spite of this, "the hunting party" together with the German production "murderous peace" starts also in this week, only the endless series of failed continues.
With "murderous peace" one can do short process: the film acts of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian topol, Max riemelt), from save from Kosovo, on which a swiftly, her falls in love.
Although it is not that once an only Serbs as the root of all evil are represented, the film is far too quickly in geballer and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for 11" without motorway but for with war.
On the other hand it can turn to "the party" almost exemplary, why it did not was never yet a correctly good Balkans.
The history of three, to open up the Serbian "the fox to trace with" would have another director and another (both in personnel Union Richard shepard) at another time perhaps a new ‘ Apocalypse Now ".
Because the stories are alike yes: go both male small teams in the forest, in order to achieve something which the soldiers and not can both male it becomes a journey into the madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "the party" is that it is not simply the Simon descended cynic with heart when he presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script, and it still a romantic affair with a Bosnian murdered later.
Finally "the hunting party" go then the brook down, if the reporters within the last five minutes in the CIA succeed in what NATO, and all of the world in five years: the war criminal catch and the Muslim Bosnians for the just revenge.
That is so bad that the International Court of Justice in The Hague because of crimes against the wishes to call.
The film has a deeply human concerns.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic still freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they are supposed to be by way of exception once agreed) pursuit due to secret political arrangements so intensively.
But the well-meant one and the evil are sometimes so similar to that a famous comes into the sense.
In that it is called on the wooden of Asian demon on the workbench of the poet: "I see the swollen front forehead: how hard it is to be bad".
Films as "the party" have exactly such swelling heads, however suggest how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the category of the limited.
Recent newspaper reports is that all Iraq films were big flops.
One can add: there has never been a good South.
Almost always applies: if a star on the elements or mine fields of the world, then something comes out of it as "Rangoon" with Patricia arquette beyond all borders, "or" blood diamonds "with" with Leonardo dicaprio.
Possibly all the conflicts within a given time simply still too.
It is, after all, decades ought to pass before Hollywood with "Schindler's list" shoot a good film about the Holocaust.
Some film will presumably still mature - as classics now geltenden "the", "Apocalypse Now" or "full metal at that time really" are not celebrated as masterpieces unanimous.
But maybe we know today, where every mass murder in real time comes on now two screens at home, also simply too much about the conflicts in the world.
And that robs the screenplay writers, which it needs in order to tell good histories.
"existence or the" or "yes" big dictator are finally therefore as well as well, because lubitsch and Chaplin did not know yet how badly the Nazi regime really prevailed.
Perhaps one may not want to be good if one wants to make good films.
Perhaps the artist look of the Lawrence Norfolk.
As the parallels between his historical novel "lemprières dictionary" and Balkan war was questioned, he replied: "that is only because some things never change.
Cities are always terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in dreadful way and always there will be war in Yugoslavia. "
Criticism reaps of Olympic cancellation of
The moving away of the mayor of the application of Olympic summer games with politics and the economy in fierce criticism.
Many want to continue to fight for the games at the water.
But realism sends a reminder of the assessment of the chances.
On Wednesday, the Chamber of Commerce, Hamburg, Hans calling on Wednesday a renouncement is not good for the economic location ".
No other project developed in recent days in the city as large as the Olympic idea.
"without this objective would have gained the could be maintained not equally."
Schmidt-trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but a new long-term approach, to find the basis of a modified ".
Ole remained Mayor of on Wednesday with previous statements that at least the up to the year 2028 are unrealistic.
"not Hamburg decides about an Olympic, but the German Olympic sport federation", said world online.
He referred to the resolution of the expected for beginning of December about an application of Munich for the winter games 2018.
"this preference is for us that we have seen in the period up to now thought by us have no realistic chance."
Nevertheless, the dream is not for all time, said.
The Hamburg Sport Federation (hsb) regretted statements of beusts.
Thus the impression that Hall in the next 25 years, no longer want to apply for Olympic Games.
It is too early to obstruct a chance for himself, by encouraging the plans already at this time buried, said Günter ploß on Wednesday.
A renunciation of the application is furthermore contrary to the statement of the one on to the General Assembly of the German.
There the application of the 2015 "not as a substitute for Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The College was only in the last week as applicant City Hall nominated.
The SPD citizens faction reproached the Senate valuable time for the House building in Hamburg to have used.
"the development of the small grasbrooks was delayed by the Senate for years because he put Olympia on the card and excluded the House construction", the SPD delegates Carola veit and January.
As for the SPD was always an integrated planning for Olympia and a subsequent use, the CDU on one side on the "factor".
The application for the 2012 Olympic summer games had initiated a great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Leipzig had defeated, however, Hamburg.
That is not warhols boxes
Who the concepts Sweden and wood thinks Ikea, but not at Andy in.
Or?
In Sweden now take a dark shadow over warhols.
A large part of the listed there of the "Stockholm" are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper "expresses some months ago about the genuineness of Andy warhols of companies in 1968, internal investigations come in in in the Stockholm now for a result: the six boxes", "former of Museum in 1995 as the the donation has bequeathed are copies - and probably the majority of the about a hundred more of the", "the Stockholm on the international art market in circulation.
The case history is encapsulated, a confusing artistic and kuratorischer productions.
In 1964, created in New York his first boxes "," the painted wooden on the design of the cardboard boxes of the soap "brillo".
An exhibition of his work in 1968 in the thought - with warhols agreement - hundreds of brillo cardboard: these (derived from cost reasons), but they were not, directly from the brillo board mill.
It was not a question of works of art, but their models to mere exhibits.
At the same time, in 1968 presumably the permission of a few brillo wooden produce in Sweden, but not in the in the were switched off.
Time witnesses speak now of about fifteen boxes which then as authorized original-andy-warhol-brillo-boxes with the names "Stockholm" to right in the art and auction history.
Some of them are more than 100 000 dollars on auctions escalation.
The problem is now that the legendary director of Museum has claimed later by mistake, it is about a hundred 1968 boxes in Sweden was produced and issued left to him then.
Indeed, only in 1990 105 boxes for an exhibition in PC St. Petersburg.
It was already three years dead.
Lars bystroem, on in the curator, along with the six museum boxes even three from Swedish private property, of which two 1968 in Stockholm were made: your pressboard plates were first and ground after, that, with a white laid on.
The structure of the copies from the year 1990, on the other hand betrays that the without with a coat directly on the laid on it - it was not a question of oil, but also about color.
"these boxes were not autorisiert from artists and from the official list of Andy warhols" can be removed, the director of the Lars in, announce: "when the 'Andy in kind board' in New York not to another, the conclusion will in the six boxes in his collection as copies / classify."
Already in July certainly the authentication board announced the ", the" serious accusations being on the soap powder boxes are raised.
But since then, one in relentless there.
