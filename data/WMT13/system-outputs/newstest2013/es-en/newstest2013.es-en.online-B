A Republican strategy to hinder Obama 's reelection
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat voter fraud.
Now, the Brennan Center latter considered a myth and claims that voter fraud is less common in the United States that the number of people dying due to a lightning strike.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found more than 300 cases of voter fraud in the U.S. in ten years.
One thing is certain : these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures partly undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line a majority of the American governments enacted, from 2009, new laws that hindered the registration process or voting.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw an increase of 675 new Republicans in 26 states.
Consequently, in 2011 introduced 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require that voters present identification with a photograph, and a U.S. citizenship test.
Moreover, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register to vote in the election day and removed their right to vote to citizens with criminal records.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state demanded that voters present a photo identification document.
The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008 upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law.
Therefore, the republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to show a valid photo ID.
It is important to note that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identification, such as Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo identification issued by a government agency in your state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack identification with those characteristics.
But often, obtaining required identification costs over a hundred dollars.
Whereupon, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than$ 35,000 per year, 18% of citizens of more than 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years do not have a valid photo identification.
And there's more.
Students in many states, most voters vote for Democratic candidates, can not use the photo identification issued by your institution.
Moreover, these same states authorize members of fishing clubs or hunting that usually vote Republican parties use documents issued by these clubs.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures seek to clearly limit the Hispanic vote.
It appears that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers supported in 2011 legislation abolishing certain voter registration on the day of polling in eight states.
In addition, limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service to help voters who would enroll.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, the registration drives to register voters contributed about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 ensured that the rate of enrollment of new voters fell in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other states that favored the reduction of early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African American, while the latter represented only 13% of voters in the state.
In the case of Hispanics was exactly the same.
These represent only 11% of voters, equivalent to 24% of citizens who vote in advance.
However, the white, representing 76% of the electorate, they represent only 46% of citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have fervently opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
In this sense, the Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The prosecution in the United States intervened to suspend the controversial laws.
It could, in part, to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Critics denounce the partisan Democrats of the laws that have been voted, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the results of 2012 in key states.
A Brennan Center report 2011 shows that the states that have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It's too early to say with certainty whether these legislative amendments scale electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential elections in 2012.
One thing is certain : these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In this regard, measures partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening : Become the test or not let them?
Indeed, the PSA test has sometimes erroneous results, with false negative or false positive results, after which it was decided unnecessary medical interventions.
It is a reason enough to make men doubt as reticent in itself, should be whether or not screening tests.
To become a test or not?
We asked two experts for advice.
In studies conducted in the United States is a great index detected infection among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed some difference in mortality between patients who had realized the detection and those without.
The study, with the track 12, also demonstrated that between 30 and 40% chance of developing metastasis was not performed if the screening test.
I recommend, therefore, the test from age 50, or after 40 years if your father has had prostate cancer.
African American men have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
Is it really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of their cancer. You must provide all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not conflict with long-term life, in which case you should rather opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today many men that have been detected are not treated cancer because the cancer is not aggressive and pose a risk to your life.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer a treatment.
Determined frequency increasingly precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that you take the test anyway.
But it is important to talk with your doctor about whether you should take the test or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing disease
Unfortunately, there is no magic formula to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of the research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles are still the best way to reduce risk for the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, they could prevent 30% of cancers.
"If no one smoked, the rate would rise at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we assessed that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the tobacco control remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
The snuff is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
Also constitutes a risk factor for other cancers.
Greatly harms people 's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said the spokesman André Beaulieu.
One encouraging fact : 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
Fatness and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.
feeding
The agency further recommended limiting consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scale the risk for colorectal cancer.
The deli products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting may cause the formation of carcinogens.
"They can damage body cells and lead to cancer development," he explained.
vitamins
In recent years, scientists have studied the links between multivitamins and cancer.
However, by the time their investigations are inconclusive.
SCC Segou, studies about vitamin E are contradictory.
While one of them was observed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another it was observed, instead, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D in cancer has not been determined clearly.
Moreover, M. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about the concerns and family history of everyone with your doctor.
"Do the test does not cause cancer detection."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson generated a stir last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that the Higgs is a participant in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence is predicted Standard Model : our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists is not entirely clear that the case of Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle that resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week in a major physics conference held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, but there are still more data to be completely safe.
In any case, we assume that it is Higgs, since the chances of mistakes seem small. We'll see what it is.
There is, in this big world, a widespread and inescapable law implies that two things can not be in the same place at the same time.
There's no way of breaking that rule and do not try too much, because it will end up hurting.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that it also has a law of its kind : the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state", a "state" consisting, roughly, of some of its features.
Physicists particles classified into two categories.
On the one hand we have the good citizens called fermions, which obey the Pauli principle wisely.
And on the other are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not by this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure Berkeley Laboratories which, incidentally, is extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: mesons, of which we will not talk here, and the "force particles", by which large forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would be in some way related.
These bosons, it should be stressed here are not exotic bugs might believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, is thanks to a remarkably banal boson : the photon or the "particle of light" that acts as a "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, "clutters" the electromagnetic field at that environment, a bit like when you throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" is born an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, the ultraviolet, etc..), And this wave is nothing that a photon, ie one of the bosons "force carriers".
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that this is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "messy" for this boson appears.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate need to reach extremely high energies, a bit like if it were a frozen pond in which only a thick rock could slide across the surface.
By this requires a huge particle accelerator like CERN (the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km in circumference!) To achieve such levels of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles or all the materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, make, but others : a piece of paper, for example, will not be maintained by itself never stuck to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field : those that do have a mass, while the rest (how the photon, by the way), do not.
Now, what "can provide" all these investigations, asks Mrs. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows the physicists escrutinen the differences between observations and predictions of MS.
For their part, many wish fervently that they are, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that covers certain model holes.
This, frankly, is still enormous gaps, as it does not propose any explanation on gravity (ups!) Or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the universe (another oops).
But we have not found such differences in CERN so far.
aftermath
The impact of this research in our day to day are difficult to predict, but we do not mistake that will not have any.
To see : the early 60s, the pioneers of lasers in the laboratory did not suspect at all that his works provoke revolution.
Glimpsed scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as I said physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, the laser was invented in 1960, and produced the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, the first laser was rather considered a ' laboratory apparatus ".
Imagine...
And further, applications can also be derived from all instrumentation surrounding research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a sensor light in 1969 in the course of his research in optics.
Although it was not his original intention whatsoever, this sensor is now serving "eye" for all digital devices in the world, earning him the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die... | Le Devoir
In his Die in Dignity Commission, Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of end of life.
The debate should resume soon while preparing a bill.
Now, within that domain essential, there is still much to do.
Le Devoir has sought closer look.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
Prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year reprieve.
"I was given five years to live, but I have been so seven," he says, made a pass, lying on his bed in the hospice Victor- Gadbois of Beloeil, which arrived yesterday.
"But it's always a shock, we can not be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has caused havoc : huge weakness that prevents you from going to the bathroom and even feed himself.
Sitting in front of a very tasty lunch, accepts resignation to help you eat.
Valiente, reaches even to smile, to talk to strangers they devote attention, bring medicines and offer a bathroom.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that I cure diarrhea, is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found that wrong remedy.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man pees standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the center Victor- Gadbois.
Return to your childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the ability of the person to accept that regression" notes.
Because, in the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place in the heart of this regression.
All patients entering the hospice Victor- Gadbois with cancer.
They have a life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them care no longer offer "healing".
The greatest fear of Mrs. A., 89, is dying "conscious and drowned."
But the disease has made him discover his children.
"I have some good kids," he adds.
"Now I have no more desire in this life," he says, before agreeing to be fitted with a mask to help her breathe.
And wait, in the next few days, a last visit to his son who lives in Italy.
In Victor- Gadbois is offered, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
Palliative care are given to them when you can not do anything else.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
Very little, since we know that all end up dying someday.
Here, life goes on in the best possible condition, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center.
Whether comfort level physical, emotional or spiritual.
When you are offered dying mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, depending on demand.
In the diabetics and controls are not your cup sugar.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we serve a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son finished his beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the center Victor- Gadbois the days pass without ever being equal.
Next to a man of 94 years who savors his last family reunion in the courtyard, well placed between your pillows while all drink to your health, a young man of 36 years dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, provided there are three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years with cancer", worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the center - Gadboisarrivent Victor comes home and 47% of the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, ie, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient arrives at the terminal phase of their lives, whether at home, in hospital or in a care.
And several agencies, including the Victor- Gadbois center and hospice society 's home Grand Montréal, specializing almost exclusively in the care of patients with cancer.
It is this large relative lack of Quebec health care which makes many specialist palliative care doctors fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since last October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec 's health care system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before accepting proceed with euthanasia.
"Recently," he says, " I saw a patient in the ER spend 14 days in great pain without having done enough to alleviate it.
I fear that patients want to die just because they do not receive proper care. "
And in parallel, many oncologists are bent with their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Survival Hopes Hélène Richard were already under minimal when left a grueling chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist I wanted to stop the treatment, she said she was very sorry that would stop fighting," he says.
"However,she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
No care almighty
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients die applying thank their caregivers that they have attended in their demands once they have relieved their pain by a palliative care team.
But I must say that palliative care are not absolutely omnipotent with respect to pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home of Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to treatments for pain in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, used to sleep the patient until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can not pretend we do not understand that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, unrelieved disease will be able to have that palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved they all say the same thing: "I want to die".
But that does not necessarily mean "want euthanasia" but "I want to relieve me."
The completion of this report has been made possible by a grant from journalism institutes of health research in Canada.
Wide-ranging real estate scandal in Quebec
Officials of the road network, BTP entrepreneurs, fundraisers parties and specialists of the Italian mafia have, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system," which includes the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and gangsters.
An "industry" that came out too expensive to taxpayers Quebecers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
" It is curious how the system is sprayed once we hunted big media, 'says Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former head of the Montreal police.
He led the scandal broke in 2011, made possible thanks to an investigation into embezzlement linked to road contracts in Quebec, the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had not allowed more than delay.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between the industry illegal funding of political parties and corruption among officials.
"Since the beginning of research in 2010, only transport ministry would have saved billions of dollars in contracts", containing some of his instincts to keep a proportion.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, while waiting to get to "demonstrate the existing stratagems behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011, applies also with his team of auditors, researchers and government analysts.
This unit operates in addition to the police "squad Marteau", which, since 2009, have made the "sewer cartel" moderate Montreal when inflated contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit proceeded to the registration number of the allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a town outside.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec City third.
If sospecha that has repeated pocketed bribes in exchange for public contracts.
It has indicted the road network engineers and entrepreneurs Montreal Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has shocked the committee to explain the mechanics of the "system" to obtain public contracts.
He himself paid for three years by 3% of the value of contracts awarded to an intermediary in Montreal linked to mafia money transferred to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
M. Zambito distributed money right and left during the 2000s, providing more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals in power.
He admitted, too, having organized an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal deputy prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
The cost inflation sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, former engineer of public works, explained it perfectly before the committee : in ten years received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey and bribes from companies in the construction sector for a total of$ 736,000, all in return for contracts whose costs inflated sewer.
Other roads officials have admitted receiving money by inflating invoices between 30% and 40% as false extras.
In addition, a party organizer mayor, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay have deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled their coffers dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected political Montreal who sounded the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière - des -Prairies, in the east of the island, opposed from 2010 to the sale of municipal land acquired for$ 5 million and 1.6 million resold by promoters in the real estate boom.
70% of the money from election campaigns was dirty money
From the research I finally held, she ensures that strip "of a thread in order to understand how the system works, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and catch the culprits."
He adds that the process is "painful but positive."
We are cleaning the wounds but would need a clean research unit in Montreal and be alert to dubious practices do not recur.
How do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for its part, states that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is restless especially the role of the ' "elected politicians aware of the ploy".
Estimating by 70% the proportion of dirty money that was spent on campaign financing in Quebec, quips : "I have said that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit to$ 100 donations to parties, but that does not change the donation, he said, "while not strictly limited election expenses, will dirty money in politics."
It advocates a comprehensive review of the system of granting public contracts and financing parties "can not sink any lower, go to the bottom of things, with courage, we will rebuild the house with a more solid foundation, with more controls and laws".
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is the FC Barcelona!"
This season he has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would you explain this progress?
It could be explained by individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I walk beside her.
The staff also provided me a lot.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything is going very quickly in football.
But I did not heated up.
From my beginnings in the center of INF Clairefontaine preforming up my time Saint - Etienne, I have always made great strides.
You will get the benefit of competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
Recruits this summer are used to play high level games.
They know that every workout is crucial.
That makes a player as I have will to fight and give everything.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my positioning.
It is supported by assistants as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the man? Needed equipment?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, no one alike in the League 1 and is among the best European coaches.
He has extensive experience and has won numerous titles at the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think it will be other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting him.
I had just emerged from a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken the position of leader.
But we in the ambush.
One of our major goals is the Champions League : we have qualified for the knockout stages in style.
What is the aim of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have much to say in front of many great European teams.
We want to begin to end the first of our league against Porto to qualify for the knockout round.
Does the PSG can become a big European club in the short term?
I have the budget...
To become a big European club, Paris has to win titles and be there long term.
Today, that is not the case.
Economically, the PSG is delivered to their means for that project completion.
No win in the League Cup 1, as in the last season, would be a big failure??
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we will invest all our efforts to take the title of champions.
Last season we did not get far.
In May we were hugely disappointed because we had optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We ended up with 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think will be good.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to grab.
Do you think the media expect more of PSG?
It is normal to expect much of us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have accepted fully.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, still encounter things that reproach is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We tried to start a game project.
A team is built with time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for the second round, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the amount invested, I would imagine with 15 points ahead of the day.
That would be neglecting our adversaries and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, they were not good last season, have been "driven" by this new PSG.
This shows that the League 1 is exciting.
May I hope that we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we finished taking us the trophy.
The PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic hits.
Better to say that we have a "Zlatandependencia".
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that puts a lot of goals.
It has come to prove who is the star of the League 1.
And has shown on all computers on which happened to be a great player, a world star.
In the group respect the man and the player.
And he also respects to the men who have around.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows all we progress.
How have you lived Euro 2012 with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this tournament.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me accumulate playing time.
I went there and saw things reinforced.
Today achieving good games to play in the selection.
It is what I expected from my baptism with the "bleus".
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and this is because we now have an exemplary behavior.
What vision do you have the first month of Didier Deschamps in front of the "bleus"?
It is getting results.
They are well placed in the group of World Cup qualifying.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires win.
As was the case of Laurent Blanc.
But I will not make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the European Championship.
I hope Didier Deschamps selection carried to Brazil.
Does the tie (1-1) on October 16 in Spain served to lay the foundation?
That game gave us confidence.
Each fought by all.
Before that shock in Spain, he had not lived a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on central banks, the transactions identified and processing loads between the parties.
Also, as often happens in technology, political vision is palpable : the conviction that the current monetary system, banking monopolies compound leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible into dollars, euros, etc.. and secure exchange protocol BitTorrent 's way, which allows the sharing of files equals.
There have been nearly 200,000 15,000 transactions by computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as payment.
The price of bitcoin, having reached the peak of$ 30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to$ 2 five months later, before returning today to be around ten dollars (the quotes were counted on page bitcoincharts. com).
It's not impressive when compared to global changes in real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in it in a report on virtual coins issued in October.
In it, he described the bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "Racing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other types of systems with virtual currencies as the "credits" used to advance a video game and you can win playing or you can buy (and sometimes even redeem).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But all sharing a central authority controls and deal with changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both trustees of ledgers, testers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two addresses as email.
A user can select a different address for each payment, ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction are electronically signed by a double cipher key.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoins changes appearing on the public ledger, which spreads throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write the new transaction in that book.
This happens by solving a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker will have the privilege of adding the complementary strand.
This is a file chopping phase, ie processing a large file into a shorter and numerical fingerprint unique.
Computers "catch" the new transaction and add a number before "chop" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular trace (more zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes is easily verified that good.
The transaction is then indestructibly chain linked to the other sets of transactions, any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit fraud, a user would pay twice for the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would accept as valid only one of the two transactions, the other would be left an orphan, as both have traces different.
The computer that meets the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regular, likely by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but are divisible to cienmillonésimo, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge are also disclosed in each increase in computing power.
The lifetime of the network already has its ups and downs.
Web sites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and robbed on deposit bitcoins.
"The ruling does not affect use same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, which just launched Paymium a payment company that uses real currency Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of blanquo of money thanks to this anonymous service.
But the cash has the same defect.
The major players like Wikipedia reject such payments.
Others, like the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, the Weizmann Insitito in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins does not circulate.
In November, they released the "sales giants."
"Changed$ 30,000" exults Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins in gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a book on that currency pedagogical, believes enough in the potential of this technology as well as in network transactions.
His system, Paytunia, equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a contactless mobile payment, but use Bitcoin to validate transactions, so are cheaper.
The carrier also manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in the shops, you do not have to install new devices or software.
We simply provide an address than a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, which claims thousands of users.
There is a general movement systems review flatter hierarchical systems.
"It will take a while for Bitcoin is imposed, but in 2013 could be a change," he predicts.
Furthermore, in its report on ECB expected to reassess the various risks, today considered high, if that currency is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army retake possession of their territory and that Afghans choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We punished especially Afghan farmers, who have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, more wounded and maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former heads refugees in Pakistan, but often also farmers who reject foreign military presence, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes join jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will no longer when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops Nijrab base, I saw from the top of the hills planted with almond thanks to French loans are made by order.
Convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without suffering any attacks, watched by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul since late 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was now empty and the country engulfed in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of release, return to safety.
The Afghans have paid the price of obscurantism of his peasants overwhelmed by the Al- Qaeda, but his situation is no better today.
The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, seizing government land for resale as solar refugees have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting the American pair of large outsourcing contracts.
They are discredited, most of them have not fought.
People, I hear on the field, aspires to a government that is not formed by thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as also will those who have taken advantage of American generosity : capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during his exile in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its benefits.
With about 65% of its population under 25 years, Kabul has right now with 5 million, one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, public schools are full of both girls and boys.
We will have to give work to these young people who will not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, are hungry for mobile phones. The Turkish television serials and feature a modern world that has great fans around the country.
The army is now present.
Is it considered legitimate authorities who want to lead the country?
The former anti-Soviet commanders worry and struggle to reconstitute the provincial militias, they will flee the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, of strong local identities, should qualify for some decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has sought to transform into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister was from the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular during elections scheduled in April 2014.
However, the country is dependent on foreign aid from the 50s and before.
No industry has reestablished its services, not fixed any reservoir nor been repaired major irrigation systems.
Everything is imported and not produced anything except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to private initiative.
In a ruined country after 30 years of war, would have required government control.
It spread rumors that Afghan poseía huge mining wealth.
And that not only increased the feeling that Westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract iron ore or copper ground without transportation for export through the mountains, no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned copper mine Mes Aynak, letting international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) dig the huge Buddhist site and remain there as major employers in the province.
It will also need to Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country largely dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations.
French troops departed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid : girls' schools, schools of children, a French department in the university, the French Institute, the cooperation in military, legal, and health and agricultural support archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of trying to "win the hearts and minds" and to perform the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions match, a service of "civil and military" the Ministry of Defence (Cimic) abolished in 2012, and did bring brought through a small French NGO numerous works of public interest and agricultural rehabilitation activities in dozens of mountain villages.
Those jobs, greedy to get local labor, may have helped contain the insurrection : irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased arable land.
What leave as a souvenir after two billion military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, very hard in those valleys often located over 2,000 meters high.
The Embassy received dozens of written applications with small agricultural proposals by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
For the release of the insurrection conducted by foreign groups, something farmers have told me they want, would it keep a small civilian aid, good control and reach them directly.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
It is a double or nothing new President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever as to the constitutional declaration, which provisionally granted full powers, he decided to play all out.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote the final text the next day.
Just last week, the head of State had two months to the Assembly to finish its work.
And nearly two years ago that Egypt used a provisional text several amendments, weakening institutional stability and leads to legal entanglements.
This new initiative has not only increased the fracture in the country.
To his opponents, the president continues with its "delirium autocratic" and continues "betraying his word" and "trampling the law."
By its supporters, ensuring that it is a measure to stop faster with the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.
In the next 15 days should organize a referendum.
A very short period of time forcing the brothers to give up his project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular legitimacy and democratic while controversy rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in their favor, as said in an interview with the weekly magazine Time.
Considering that this resource has voted very quickly, contains an ultimatum to the Egyptian people, "or vote my text or keep full powers" powers that supposedly come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, Islamist overwhelmingly voted yesterday text.
Most liberals did not attend the announcement.
In mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, had closed the door because they felt that they could not enforce their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve a quorum, yesterday morning 11 people added, substitute members, hastily.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As expected, the items have been voted unanimously.
To the commentators amuses them, on the other hand, the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day is expressed nearly the hour of prayer, so much so that several committee members came to think that the clock Constituent was wrong.
The text, which yesterday afternoon was still being voted, consists of 234 items.
Article 2, object of attention, finally remains identical to the 1971 Constitution, which stated that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
Salafi parties for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hopefully be able to replace the "principles" by "the rules", which would have allowed stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their good will and their respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals be labeled as hypocrisy and consider that it is nothing more than a publicity stunt.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is made through other items.
They refer, in particular, Article 220, which gives the Al- Azhar University an advisory role, particularly for anyone who has to confirm their compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, is disturbing because "people are to decide not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy. "
Liberals Fears are further increased by the fact that the next president of the university would be far less moderate than today.
" For now, there is no particular religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are in the context of marital status.
Most lawyers who have worked in this text are not mullahs but college, some of them trained in the French system, "explains Alexis Blouet, preparing a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity about Article 220 , because the terms used mimic the religious vocabulary.
" We refer in particular to the term IQH [ Islamic jurisprudence, editor's note ].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are civil courts have jurisdiction over this. "
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received much criticism relating to extended powers conferred by the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few in comparison with those who were under the previous regime.
Another point of conflict : the powers conferred on the army.
Accordance with the wish of the military, the Defense budget review will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national council of defense.
Nor prohibit prosecution of civilians in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defense of human rights.
They also showed their concerns relating to the text, which consider liberticidal.
The offense of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, the insults are prohibited, which could have serious implications for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
Furthermore, no article emphasizes the protection of women, Heba Morayef stresses of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive was the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word is not contained in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was out last night on TV, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The head of state supporters demonstrated on Saturday.

"The great and powerful" will take you to Moscow : immigrants save for language
While deputies and human rights defenders argue about the consequences that the law on compulsory examination, have already appeared in the country certified scammers who sell "fake"
Each year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most are citizens of countries of Central Asia : Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its sole purpose is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
From December 1 enters into force a law, according to which every immigrant labor should perform a test to check your knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule is applicable only for those who intend to work in the services sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised in the Federal Migration Service, the tests will be mandatory for all immigrants.
Furthermore, it is sufficient to take the examination of the language, but also the Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
The knowledge of the language should be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
Exception are citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
They are not subject to this law people who successfully get their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Utility doom and rights
The network of examiners work sponsored by Pushkin Russian Language Institute, University of Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian institutions of higher learning.
Immigrants may be submitted to the tests in all the cities, now in Russia are open more than 160 such centers.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But advocates of the rights, long before the law came into force, succeeded many times to ask this question to the press : And what this actually provide?
What changes will bring the obligatory knowledge of the language, both for the Russians as to the immigrants themselves?
First, meet representatives of the Immigration Service, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "slave labor."
Many people talk today about the rights of labor migrants, says Victor Sebelev, chief representative of the Federal Migration Service of Russia in Tajikistan.
The defense of their rights should be initiated prior to departure.
Only organized selection system will solve the problem of migrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems the immigrants have no profession, education, those who know the language and pass the medical control.
Without understanding the language, says Sebelev, the intending immigrant will be sentenced to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping him mess a ' little trip paid " a creepy and narrow den, where he and dozens of others like consumed him for months without food or documents, working 12-14 hours a day.
We received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise one thing, but on arrival they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, not paid promised wages" confirms the Head of the Department of Labour immigration Immigration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Do not get angry, jefecito!
However, while many citizens of the republics of Central Asia who want to work in Russia recognize that not only do not know the language of the country you intend to go, but also in their own language written with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but his own misfortune few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford to receive regular primary education.
This is because their families do not even have anything to feed the children, not to mention dressing, putting them on and buy them you need for school.
Upon reaching adolescence, these guys are venturing to work at the first opportunity.
It is difficult if you do not know the language, recognize them.
"You feel humiliated and inferior".
However, in regard to the law on language rights advocates point out an important point.
The examinations will be held only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If you do not have that status, there will be no consideration and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or No Trespassing strangers"
Many visitors say they receive official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
Furthermore, legalization costs money : for 12000-16000 rubles.
However, a false registration can be done quickly and for only 1500 rubles.
Employees of the Russian police know that we usually false documents are not registered and extortion cases appear.
"We ask one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," he told reporters citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov.
"Come on, do not be stingy, buy a painting"
The first day of the entry into force of the law on the tongue, it became clear that not only alien registration documents may be false.
Several certificates "false" knowledge of language have been seized by officers of the Federal Migration Service.
The forged documents were printed on standard printers color.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners as a gift : every immigrant, willing to make it easier to pass the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and half times more expensive than the formal procedure, which cost the three thousand migrant worker.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption for the "diplomas" not to buy, converge government officials and rights defenders.
So far, the authorities can promise the immigrant workers that could not successfully pass the exam the first time to study the basics of the language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Home Office does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered guns is quite small
The Home Office intends to apply the law more rigidly in relation to owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government's reaction to the recent incidents : Tighten gunfire during wedding celebrations in which fortunately no casualties, and the slaughter began by lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov Moscow, which Tighten seven people were killed.
The police want to ban the use and possession of weapons in public places and traumatic raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry firearms, 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and combating corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the law on weapons possession will be taken to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hardline".
In the network appeared an open letter, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations shooters require desist from such measures "rigorously nonsense".
The percentage of vandalized with registered weapons is minimal, told the BBC news service Russia, Vasiliy Lesnikov criminal lawyer.
According to Ministry of Interior, for six months of the year 2012 142 crimes were committed using firearms registered in organs of the Interior, 1168 to total recorded crime for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the field of civilian weapons will not be an inconvenience to which the offender is directed to the black market.
Now, in his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at low prices.
Meanwhile, in the Interior Ministry stated that the situation of illegal arms proliferation is under control.
Try: from factories to official
He black market arms is supplied through various channels.
Main channels are, says retired Col. Victor Baranets, who for ten years he worked in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the Web site that accepts orders for weapons
The first, "vestige of the army or military", ie the weapons were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officials and by the same Caucasian" says Baranets.
The next type of "black gun", the stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes the weapons stolen from police stores and those stolen directly by officials of the organs of law enforcement.
Illegal guns go on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals often had explosions.
"There are versions demonstrated that some fires were deliberately to cover the lack," a former soldier.
According Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their two cents.
"Now private factories have proliferated weapons that are not competitive in the international market and distribute underhand weapons black market, including Moscow", says the expert.
A black market source is smuggling.
Lots of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"They have their own production, sometimes handmade, and trained a mafia that has organized the flow of weapons," said the former soldier.
Where are the weapons?
Experts have calculated what is the approximate share of each of these sources of illegal arms supplies to the black market.
A report on this subject was made in 2011 by the Center for problem analysis and public management planning.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, criminological literature and publicly accessible data portals whose theme revolves around guns.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from the military and security forces.
Half the black market weapons has arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to weapons," he said in the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there is armed conflict, 14% of all cases is stolen during the production of weapons and 5% corresponds to the "archeology illegal."
The clerk of one of the gun shops, who asked that his last name not be mentioned, said that the weapons found by illegal diggers not buy one for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, providers targeting military stores when they need a game.
Through a lieutenant, the supplier buys a unit, eg a TT pistol.
The deleted from the log and pass it over the fence.
"This takes the gun to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two magazines," says
"But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically when the plan must meet crime detection, performed test purchases to illegal arms dealers," says the clerk.
"Like a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually found through acquaintances.
"I visited web pages and blogs to a guy who asked me to come to the platform" Begovaya "where a man would take me to a" little corner " where we could negotiate.
The price of the gun, I found only there. "
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says store clerk. "I have a friend like that, but I really trust him."
In the markets there are vendors, but there also has to come, say "for Mr. Ivanovih, who asked him to say that he had lost a tooth to his daughter."
Even I can get a pair of brass knuckles by a trusted person.
He supplied me also just me because he knows I will not reveal.
The novice seeking weapons of different ways.
The former soldier Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid -1990s, he was preparing to publish an article on this topic.
Schemes, in his words, have not changed.
He was given a photo album where there was "everything".
"I felt like a luxury boutique," says the soldier.
The buyer, in the words of Baranets, no bait and switch offer : everything can be tested.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy, go with the seller of the forest, where we put a target.
"I get the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we begin to negotiate," describes how the expert.
Store sofas
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", which offers buy weapons "for different purposes".
For this does not require any documents or personal meetings.
"It's not enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the advertisement "Buy a gun or a machine gun."
There, users place their orders and questions.
And sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user to "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"I buy TT pistol. Moscow", laconically formulates his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of websites captures two fictitious and hands to those who want to buy guns.
And people will like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
former soldier and military commentator Viktor Baranets
I've heard of these systems : generally, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
"In response, I sent a photo and instructions so you know where the gun is hidden," says the press secretary of the NGO "The right to arms," Dmitri Kislov.
Baranets Viktor says that if you make an order online, you're left without a weapon and thrown in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of websites captures two fictitious and hands to those who want to buy guns.
"And people will like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for$ 100
When buying illegal weapons, according to experts, one can spend 100-900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The right to arms," a Makarov pistol can be purchased for U.S.$ 100-300.
They should wait a month and a half.
It is sent from military stores by mid-level commanders.
According to official statistics from the ministry, compared with the period January to October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia fell by 7%, which is 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of arms, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.

In recent days, the United States has started a wave of protests against low wages paid in the supermarkets of the corporation Walmart and restaurants of the popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
By now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave come at nine points, or if you lose strength and amansarse intended in its early stages.
Protest actions have the support of trade unions and a number of leftist NGOs.
In addition to the modest increase in wages earned by workers in Walmart and fast food system, the goal of the organizers of the protests is the creation of trade unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the union movement.
Forty -six cents a year?
Stocks started last week, after Thanksgiving Day, known as "Black Friday". That day, in the United States coomenzaba the orgy of cuts that captured million, and sometimes was accompanied by clashes.
That day, some Walmart employees of the corporation, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and formed picket lines with unions and leftist activists in the tents of the corporation, whose products target people of modest and moderate.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those of the larger supermarkets.
That's why many Walmart workers underpaid buy only at work.
The availability and product assortment have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
In the words of two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain of poor working conditions, such as lack of forklift or hand scanners.
That "Black Friday" rally participants demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
For a typical worker Walmart, which receives$ 9.5 per hour, this cost is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average wage to$ 12 an hour, this will cost the corporation$ 3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than they spent on salaries now.
If Walmart sets the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the shop will find only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of$ 12.39 more than you spend now.
Walmart supporters commenting satisfied that the protest had taken place only in nine states and did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" in their stores lasted from 8 pm on Thursday until midnight the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold over 5000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers performed "Black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.
The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with leftist website Huffington Post, who left his job "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest was not just "another PR stunt"organized by the labor union.
"Free Box"
Protests continued this week in New York, in which the goals were not exactly the department store Walmart (which in this progressive city will not have appreciated, so for now there is none), but the "McDonald's" and other restaurants Cheap.
McDonald 's says that sells billions of servings, and then not even granted sick leave and not pay you for your work honest!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council
Currently, according to the federal and New York, the minimum wage is$ 7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are going to increase over time, but only slightly, and average, ordinary workers in New York receive$ 8.90 per hour.
Nobody wins unless they in this city.
How is it possible to survive in New York with the money, to me is incomprehensible.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers went through the McDonald's and worked there, behind the counter, part time after school, but still living with their parents.
Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or were planning to stay there long.
Now, constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal is a commentary whose author says it is irresponsible to have children if she does not know what to feed them.
The participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 am on Thursday at the McDonald's of 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and fast food cooks start paying them at least$ 15 per time, that is, they were double its current minimum wage.
They also demanded that the fast food sector unions are created.
U.S. law prevent administration prohibits this right and punish labor movement activists with tricks and layoffs.
Moreover, the administration rarely makes life easier.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions covering quick meal sector.
A major is the excessive turnover.
discordant
Noisy protests took place the same day in other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at the McDonald's located near Times Square, in which several politicians local Democrats, including City Council member city Jumaane Williams, who said : "McDonald's says it is selling billions of servings, and then not even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example the candidate Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support workers fast food sector to achieve fair wages and economic prosperity you deserve every New Yorker."
As described by the New York Times, this was the largest event of its kind in American history of fast food.
But it took only a few hundred people, even not all of them were employees of fast food service, which trabakan tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not clear if this will spark to cause a mass movement.
"For now, trick the brain is not so easy"
The augmented reality theme, so popular among fans of modern technologies, lately mainly normally perceived through the prism of special glasses.
In early summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a model in movement and later, in November, it was revealed that Microsoft had also submitted an application to the relevant patent claim.
However, in a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology in Microsoft's Cambridge lab, Izadi Sharamom, was elucidated that scientists of that company, the glasses and belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted by the prospect of virtual object manipulation in the air with his bare hands and the establishment of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject matter of his research group?
- We specialize in human-computer interaction, but also try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
For now, the vast mass of humanity has been trapped in the stage of working with flat screen pixels, sometimes touched with your finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today is sold without any Xbox Kinect, and that everyone interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold?
- Although Kinect interaction has led to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we work in truly three-dimensional display systems, based on different technologies, including design.
They should release the computer world to ours, physicist, make it more tangible.
For this, however, we must recognize not only the user, but also the surrounding space.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable.
First,to hell with those silly virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A detail very popular, but do not you think it overestimated?
- Of course it can not be considered a panacea, left unresolved the issue of privacy as it does not always want others to know of our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in his own field.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we think about the gestures, but not loose motions but shorter.
Furthermore, gestures were not captured by the device camera, but for a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
It is now very large, but in theory can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future is to control combined type, eg gesture + speech.
- How so?
- For example, how would you ask me that would happen this can of soda?
You talk and display at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that will be very difficult to recognize.
- You mean, you want to force users to adapt to what can or can not do at this time the machine?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think in the near future we will have to work primarily in the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors because they provide good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about his work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints you have modern cameras?
¿ Les lack resolution, depth on something more?
- In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the issue is not the megapixels, but the quality of the array and depth.
From the latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, this is more work to algorithm designers.
So, we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y, but also in Z.
Also important is the speed, number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and current of 30 fps are truly scarce, especially gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor processing adjustable delay 1-100 ms and it is noteworthy that the modern mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands what extent this affects the human-machine interaction.
To me it would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but does not require contact so that the frames per second more.
- What is necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "chambers", one of which is indeed infrared transmitter and the second receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third chamber is actually a simple tuning fork sensor visible.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more number of cameras may solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog Kinect, play with the curvature of camera location and see how this would help determinr dimensional position.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has submitted his glasses to the public.
Do not you think that, from the point of view of daily use augmented reality technology, the glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smartphone in the hands, not very comfortable, but I think, the best option would be an augmented reality "transmutable" when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could spend sunglasses to your smartphone,
The glasses are very personal devices, in that is its strength (private things only you can see them), but also its weakness : one based augmented reality glasses will not work on virtual objects with others.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in air is available not only for Tony Stark in the movie "Iron Man", but also for any mere mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point :no tactile feedback!
The hands do not feel anything!
What answers prepare your group for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh appearance in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth could be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as support for the image.
Registerperfect touch!
But there are technologies that are truly designed to bring tangibility to these "images in the air." For example, the interference of various ultrasonic beams directed at a specific point where the finger gives a feeling similar to what you feel if someone was blowing in the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what seems like it should feel when you see something?
- That's a good idea, we have not tried yet.
Here lies another challenge that we have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space that will create open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not such as gyms), mobile platforms, as well as the giant balloons.
For now, trick the brain is not so easy, even you have to work for many years.
That's what makes it attractive to work with virtual reality researchers, many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste rather than culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "St. Petersburg Avant-Garde", dedicated to the people that are in front, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city often find recognition in Europe without Russia even know them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, which can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or trendy meetings and inaugurations.
Kirill Miller 's paintings always attract crowds wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those storytellers purely sociofilósofos St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright representative of St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80's - early 90's.
It is also an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the town awaken in the people smiles and lifts all the mood.
Recently, he took a barrel organ and became the organ of St. Petersburg, as it has matured as difficult to paper, bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you going around town dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red because I am fashion designer and dedicate myself to the look and image.
In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, the image makers and society.
Although society, everything that is not a little gray aggressiveness and agitation raises nothing good properties.
But my provocations are intended to start a conversation.
The entire history of my provocative actions are an invitation to debate.
- When you realized you had to be an artist?
- In an exhibition Nevsky Palace of Culture, where he exhibited my works.
I realized that this was my path.
Then the old wave of unofficial artists was over, and the new, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with post setting out in Gaza and Nevsky, which led to "Pushkinskaya -10", and it's over the next wave.
I fell into the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but no letters.
- And all this came together in your art clinic... - For me it was important to meet the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where he had to meet the best creative minds.
In 1995, I took a territory Pushkinskaya -10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical arts club, bohemian club, bohemian house in St. Petersburg.
Many were born there : Noms, Tequila Jazz, remember how Schnur brought the project to "Van Gogh 's Ear."
Schnur and his friends sang songs under phonogram light, wearing tight pants, among them was currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began playing live, became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was animator of many programs before Hali - galivskih times.
We gave Trachtenberg and was the beginning of his great career, basic education and training he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", the " Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and repeat customers.
I am a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was made in the press, the prize was "The people of our city."
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" was chosen me, so ended my climax.
In these new times is not convenient to work, I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our times it is easy to catch on, but the culture and popularity are separated. One may be popular but little worship.
- There is something recognizable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, clearly expressed in them today and occurrence.
I will make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be outgoing, but now be so painful and frightening.
But clowns all smears and tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, bizarre thoughts I have.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and coercive change of clothes.
Now follow him one by clothing, verging on the outside, but not inside the person.
And, maybe that person is not owed or shaking hands, but spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed when changing clothes.
- I recently saw you in the role of urban organ. - A cultured city should have a hero well.
Whobetter than me to be!
- Well but how to best commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, be tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people clustered in herds, Bohemians wanted one thing, the simpletons other.
Now all have been divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar bill to be liked by everyone.
Now we have to think about who you like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
-And to listen to Stas Mikhailov arrive by thousands!
- Will see the abandoned, there does sex - social sphere.
And a cultural event going 300 people, 10 000 never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything fades.
I have my fans, most importantly, do not cheat, do not spoil what you have accomplished.
When I was young it was such a collector 's paintings had hung on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually ends.
Now often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of culture yesterday, grew up on the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money just to paint pictures.
I am in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what is missing from St. Petersburg?
- Buenos experts in culture.
There is a concept : official culture.
But not all of them may engage culture.
When kings were correct it was otherwise, the Kings may not understand very well the culture, but knew it was necessary to maintain the right experts.
In Moscow there are now very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg that could well be experts, but they are closed, because they need a higher level experts to evaluate them properly and to open the way.
Now is thriving subjective personal taste.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is for you St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is no ground.
But on our stones is difficult for the art grow.
Cultural field and we need now more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people that will curiously exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is negligible.
We have to make art is in fashion, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented by a grant from St. Petersburg.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or asteroid collision with a murderer.
Caravans of spacecraft with humans on board start looking for a spare planet.
To preserve humanity is the main question: How to continue the species in weightlessness or replacement the same planet?
I think there is little choice.
In fact, only two are true planets can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says lead researcher State Astronomical Institute, PK Sternberg (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life on the surface temperature of Venus is 500 degrees.
Only you can live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
He began to address the problems of reproduction in space with flora.
Half a century ago who conducted experiments with plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ in any of the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the insects breeding in orbit, small fruit flies, the fruit flies.
In 1979 he was sent to space quail eggs to see how the embryo develops in weightlessness.
We obtain results in a regular chick.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, must stand on its own feet and get moving," says Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IWP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Finding no support, tumbled random chicks.
And after 10 hours in neonates there was a total atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days just died.
"And twice we get the chicks were born, but then I gave up because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev on failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last time a "miniarca" biological flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" travel only species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space and fetuses.
In principle, nothing was found supernatural.
"This was precisely the biosatélites, but this was a unique experiment and studies like this should be done," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats had descendants.
However, not yet been achieved to address the problem directly reproduction space.
It is a difficult challenge.
The animals, losing their usual habitat simply can not perform their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals can in principle.
Homo sapiens have abstract reasoning and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments were not performed for ethical reasons.
But women go into space for 50 years.
The greatest risk is passed Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female body.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say, if after a flight into space.
May or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," says Vakhtang aerospace veteran Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who orbited twice and even worked in the open, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, only a handful of astronauts after long flight who they have found all well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," summarizes the pilot cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, mankind must find some new avenues in biotechnology, radiation protection, the creation of artificial gravity.
The Center hydrolab cosmonauts preparation is an essential step in the preparation for the flight.
In zero buoyancy, practice their skills cosmonauts working in space.
The water simulating weightlessness.
If an adult water is a comfortable, though still hostile for a newborn child is his native element.
The small amphibious men seem to confirm that life on Earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside the mother in amniotic fluid, it will be easier then the water used.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth until the time of the first bath spend only two weeks.
"This is very little to forget something," says Marina Aksenov, swimming instructor newborns.
In short, if a state of weightlessness is more natural for a newborn, for women is necessary gravitation, the force of gravity.
In weightlessness the abdominal muscles and pelvic decrepitate quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, we omit that, relying on the action of stimulants for delivery.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, it will push.
"Then what?" Valeri Polyakov is this original question.
Moreover, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without a sense of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton and the muscular system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to dress him in a special suit for training, as well as adults.
Just be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment we are going to do together, to allow the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to us to bring to Earth a disabled, a person totally unsuitable" provides the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of biomedical Problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical question.
However, over time this will become a reality, when human beings in their ships are directed to a distant planet that will be home for their children born in space.
NKÚ Chief : System Inspection "Švarc" no politician has found guilty
In terms of public allotments, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and good legislation, but implementation is lame.
So says Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect" but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we need" and describes the current situation.
Sets controls Czechs and Germans inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of malpractice mentions Petr Nečas attitude towards the system to be autonomous only on paper, which is known as the system "Švarc".
The Prime Minister recently said the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother with inspectors entrepreneurs. So what is forbidden or permitted?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if you prohibit something, in this case, neither the prime minister can impede the performance of the office that is required to perform such checks or demand obligations," notes Kala.
At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the House of Representatives, you spoke of the joint project between the Czech and the German team, within which compared the legislation regarding public purchasing in both countries.
What exactly?
It is a parallel control we started to realize about two years ago.
Put simply : European legislation regulates how they should organize public awards, this is followed by the laws in force in each country and then practice itself.
We've joined all and while control is still ongoing, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the laws of our country is "stricter and more complete", however, clearly evident in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that incorporate not just increasingly strict rules, but is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What indeed can bring this project? What do you think are the conclusions?
Precisely common control like this could help us to stop investing effort in the realization of the laws, reduction and improvement of bounds, even though it has such a positive impact.
The economy of savings means getting a proper thing for a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to prevent enrichment and, ultimately, the criminal actions.
But not for the fact of reducing the limit of the awards mean we get it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paperwork" that those who want to find fault in the system will make it more easily than if the boundaries are kept as high as now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation governing public prácticaa of awards.
How does the system of checks in Germany?
Is an office like our NKÚ or organized differently?
On how to offices, as the NKÚ, there acts the German Federal (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to ours, with a school too, only thing is that if one is structured somewhat differently, but in principle evolve both offices simultaneously.
Also the skills are somewhat similar, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the national audit found even at this level. In this aspect our system is slightly different.
The Federal Court of Audit (BRH) can only control the federal money, what we call state funds.
Public funds that are managed by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled in the Federal Court of Auditors.
As local law, is simpler than ours?
Usually I would not make a comparison without specifics. However, Germany remains a model in some ways, but we can not determine exactly which is better.
Could be better, for example, as to the quality of inspectors?
That sure did not, but again, I do not like such comparisons.
Needless to say, even those countries that we model must deal with a large number of problems.
Otherwise, no benefit would not work with our office, do not you think?
As for the legislation of our country, what it meant to her office amendment bill on public allotments? Is it somehow manifests its impact?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, has not been demonstrated in the control actions.
Since we control ex post, it must have a certain delay.
For now, it appears in the process of preparation of future controls : We have launched a new tool "noneconomic risk detection", which we have spent almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, since adjusting the boundaries, correcting the conditions of some types of the selection process and the like.
Do you think that the passage of this law is beneficial or, rather, is a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope it does.
The problem that can arise is that the legislation "harden" and make it impossible to comply.
As with the previous legislation, persons controlled were linked to the contractor (eg, in the case of regional operational programs of the regional council), and every law not respected in the field of public allotments meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then tighten the law in this way?
I do not think so.
The system should exclude those who want to take advantage of it attacking or not to punish those who commit a formal ruling, which has no impact on decision making.
A system of this type will only create more bureaucratic pressure.
And what comes out of this?
We'll see where this road takes us started.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the ODS would not bother with controls entrepreneurs called Švarc system, with reference to being independent only on paper. What does this mean?
Does the system Švarc " is forbidden or permitted?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits something, then not even the prime minister of the government can prevent Office action that is required to perform such checks and demand obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow", but can not say we like nothing.
In the public purchasing law, the rules are quite strict in terms of how we should act formally. And that is as it should be to protect the public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic to exclude the candidate with the best deal for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads have icy patches, although most are passable
In several locations in the Czech Republic have patches of ice roads and snow.
Although most roads are passable, some caution should be taken.
Región de Karlovy Vary
This morning the roads in the region of Karlovy Vary were passable, but had patches of ice and snow.
The temperature drops and will range from five to ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low snow cover is thin.
In contrast, in the ridges of the Ore Mountains snow reaches nearly 30 inches.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information operations control center of the roads in the region.
The fast track and the road R6 -class in the region are now passable without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially in some bridges whose surface may be icy and be slippery.
Likewise also all roads are passable second and third categories, including mountain roads.
However, there are still some sections with traces of ice and packed snow.
Must be increased attention on the road, especially in the higher elevations.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
In some roads in eastern Bohemia is no danger of frost and at higher elevations in the mountains and may have formed a layer of snow on the tracks, reported in its pages the Directorate of roads and highways.
The road workers warn drivers of the danger to form ice sheets, especially at higher elevations of the Pardubice region.
Frost may occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Myta, and especially on the roads of second and third categories.
The roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been treated chemically.
There is snow on the roads especially the mountains of Krkonoše to Orlické.
There is a layer of packed snow in the higher areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky will be today between cleared and partially cloudy, no precipitation.
The temperatures will generally range from three below zero and a positive rating, weak winds blow.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen Region are passable this morning, but must Extreme caution and will need time to adapt.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frost, temperatures will range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snow and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some roads may also be covered with ice.
In some places, drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will improve gradually.
This is what emerges from the information of the operations control center of roads in the region.
The D5 highway is passable almost no restrictions, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between km 80 and 131.
The surface of most first-class roads are dry and free of ice.
In the area of Pilsen and Tachov road bordering Germany may have sections with ice sheets.
Pathways second and third categories are wet, so that in this case also warns sections with ice sheets.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on the roads less traveled in the Šumava.
Region of Olomouc
Drivers who go to the higher elevations of the Olomouc region will encounter snow partially discarded.
After chemical treatment, was still snow on the Červenohorské port and the road towards Videlský kříž.
The road workers removed snow during the night, in the accumulated Šumperk road about three inches of snow, according to managers of the tracks.
In the remaining region, the majority of roads are passable without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of Šumperk road, remnants of snow.
Drivers in the port will encounter snow Červenohorské means disposed towards Jeseník ", has confirmed today an operator of the road administration Šumperk to CTK.
On the ground and at night went to the Jesenická also his colleagues and, after chemical treatment, the slopes of the highest areas are now clear and wet.
In Olomouc highway roads are passable without restrictions of Šternberská the drivers should drive with caution in the forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem and Liberec region
Operators of northern Bohemia roads have reported complications in different sections early in the morning.
Apart from a few places that have snow or ice, according to the database of police mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures remain below freezing, even in the lower areas, so that ice and snow remain on the road course. In contrast, in the lower areas, especially in the southeastern Czech central massif, no problems and roads usually are dry.
By mmento there have been no complications of service.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions were ideal overnight. During the day expect rain and melting snow and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.

The road between Knínice Telnice and had to be cut from the branches of the trees that had arched over the road with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest : In our shows we accumulate positive energy
It is said that in less than a month will come the end of the world, what do you think about it?
It is only one among many other alarmist news we like to hold on to.
The music group The Tap Tap rather we like to joke about it and we like to say we are the only band in the world to get together enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
Furthermore, in December organize yourselves truly original project : three concerts with the end of the world.
Can you explain to our readers?
This is a charity event that took planning state for two years.
We decided to leverage the marketing potential that is the end of the Mayan calendar statement for December 21 at 11:10 am.
The day before, on December 20 at 21 am, we will host three simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
End at approximately the same time that the Mayan calendar ends in the Kiribati island in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially my idea, after forging the project went together with our designer Honza Augusta.
Besides wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we want to reflect, together with society, on the state of the world we leave our children.
To mark the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, shirts, bags and original keychains against the end of the world that are available at www.e - tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap The group, along with other performers, also sang the hymn called against the end of the world, entitled "End of the World, canceled".
Currently it is very popular on YouTube, is able to hear at concerts beneficial?
Of course, and will be just the last, well, if all goes well and the world ends...
The performers sing all at the same time in all three concerts.
The hymns will be linked to each other simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the lead role of Jesus in the video, where he sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration?
We work with other personalities including the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charity events and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most interests them and they enjoy working with us.
What do you use the money raised at concerts against the end of the world?
A school equipment for Studeo barrier, which we term in its sixth consecutive year of the civil association in Jedličkův ústav Tap.
Students at the school receive regular ústav Jedličkův visit teachers we made fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay the teachers and make a EINFORCING to make this possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building to which we will go to this project.
At each concert act several groups and performers.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a program that is appealing to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiri Suchy.
For more detailed information, you can check www.kpks.cz.
Have you planned some other "spectacular action" like in the future?
In May act for the first time at the festival Pražské bird, so here surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and me personally, we are building in the United States, I would like to complete with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your overseas plans are not exactly minimalist, until now have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap are in the meantime, a group formed by people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in electric wheelchair, the seats should ride in the luggage compartment and also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have managed well. CSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which never ceases to amaze.
Even in Moscow, where we have returned recently, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to trips abroad can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and others.
What have you found so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here, in Russia we have seen that in the east, is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still not common for a person to travel alone through the city center on a power wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, give preference to someone in a wheelchair lift, there is not.
Luckily, we have created a civil association strives thematize the problems of people with disabilities.
What aspects should take example of developed countries?
There are many ways in which we are behind...
But it is important to mention that the refinement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid is very normal for people with severe disabilities to travel on their own in public and can go to the service, the museum, wherever...
But it is very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate in an active social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tapgoing a little ahead!
A society that respects and without barriers is one thing, but when the moment arising eminent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, begin to change all really.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap The group is currently very popular, but if you look a few years back, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I started as ústav Jedličkův educator, where he had many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a coworker.
And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, we were a little out of hand (laughs).
However, the popularity did not come until the last few years, am I right?
It really helped us a lot the fact singers connect and actively work to promote the group.
We conclude that the work is not seen, it is like there.
Thanks to the support of the European Union, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc..
Did you intend to go that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential he had, to do anything otherwise.
The entertainment world is full of things that look like each other.
It stands in its way, everything new is welcomed cautiously and takes a long time to be accepted.
There are few things extraordinary, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion is a natural reaction...
But compassion is entirely superfluous because people with disabilities are not left suffering beings and we should have compassion.
Some people are able to live a full and developed, provided of course that the necessary resources available.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then, is not only a breakthrough for them, but for the entire society.
Did the fact that you are an exacting boss, as he describes many people?
If you want to do quality work, we must be rigorous in many respects and to require some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people go with a romantic view and head in the clouds and when they learn they have to go two days to rehearse, go to school and try to spend much time traveling and concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandoned them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The group currently has twenty members Tap Tap.
How many of them were already in the beginning of 1998?
Only one : Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, the people come and go, you can not avoid.
Whoever has will and desire will always find open doors
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 am
It will take place in Prague Incheba Arena in Fléda Plynojem Brno and Ostrava and involve 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected by the end of the evening via videoconference to sing together the song by The Tap Tap "End of the World, canceled"
The aim of the concert is to bring together the resources necessary to fund school equipment multifunctional barrier ústav Jedličkův Studeo in Prague, the cost is 25 million CZK.
The concert ticket cost 400 CZK and children 12 and under are admitted free presale option in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency held last week was accepted Poland as the twelfth member of the ESA. It is the second member of the ESA former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on November 12, 2008).
Poland began an intense collaboration with the ESA in 1994 and in subsequent years participated in the commission of agency projects.
However, the way from Poland to the cosmos began much earlier.
Poles and enthusiasts dedicated themselves to flights into space before the Second World War, although not always understand his work.
I remember, for example, the conference of A. Sternfeld 's astronomical observatory that Warsaw in the December 6, 1933, presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to space flight."
The ideas of the young engineer (b. 1905) left the audience indifferent and, years later, Sternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski was the only one who had shown interest in their work.
In 1934 Sternfeld earned the award in France Robert Esnault - Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his "Introduction to space flight."
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a great promoter of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of space flight, was known throughout the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name to one of the craters on the far side of the moon.
Already in 1925 one was built in Poland Dresina was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the proponent and Destaller not know the project.
It is unclear whether the rocket would be used to boot the Dresina or for braking.
Information on this Dresina is limited to that in the press of the time.
Beginning in 1933 the Polish artillery began to engage missiles.
The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the material retained, it becomes clear that the investigation came to the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation stopped.
In 1937 appeared in the press a prototype missile photoelectric hunting Rohozinski designed by engineer and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba Lotnicza" Leliwa - Krzywoblocki author.
Both projects were intended for military use for missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Komitet Tymczasowy Doradczo - Naukowy) was responsible for all technical projects of missiles for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, was interrupted by the outbreak of war.
Other studies on space flight appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 edition of the journal Problemy referred first society with very large four articles dedicated to astronautics.
In one of them, the prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to astronautics.
At that time had already launched artificial satellites projects was obvious that it was a cosmic research discipline prospects.
Since early 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) aspired to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this post until his death in 1959.
As of 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of sounding rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a hit and became the first Polish rocket which carried out scientific research.
The first type RM- 1 was completed in 1957 and first released on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had a height of 1800 meters, about 80 cm in length and was less than 5 kg of weight.
Later, was completed RM- 1A version in the summer of 1959 and began testing rockets overhead RM-2 two-stage Błędów desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket development would be subject to real scientific study. The RM- 34 rocket would have a height of 14.5 km and its mission is to control the wind high.
However, in 1962 work was suspended.
The successor of the first rockets was rocket type RM Meteor -1, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
Was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Developed three types (called Meteor- 1A, - 1B and -1C), which is differentiated by the space available for scientific apparatus.
Meteor the rocket -1A available space for the volume was 0.4 liters in the Meteor- 1B 0.34 liter Meteor- 1C at 0.62 liters.
The maximum height for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 took place at the Institute Meteor Air -2 rocket, which first air testing began in October 1970.
The Meteor -2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg, and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg to 60 km high.
Version was later built and Meteor Meteor- 2H -3.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of COSPAR National Committee two years later.
In the framework of Interkosmos, Poland joined cosmic space research on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish driver Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
The constitutional court last week suspended the social traabajos law.
The decision sparked a heated debate in society.
Of course it will be interesting to examine the existing problems from a broader perspective.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that different forms economic and national economic systems permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unrestricted movement of private capital, along with rampant financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labor costs (in wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the importation of cheap goods, try to close the gap and it "causes a bajadda" competitor pricing in order to gain most of the market and, thereby increase its profit margin.
A large scale means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buy there cheaper or disappear. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labor, in comparison with other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has not any social responsibility and thus, is not responsible for this phenomenon generates unemployment, growing social necessarily state spending.
This situation favors the total lack of business by paying taxes and offset the economic and social damage they have caused in their quest for profit.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to present factual statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations in certain economies, in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social status of the people themselves and, thus, attract foreign capital country.
Put another way, governments put private capital available to its own population without considering social decline.
This is evident especially in the changing laws.
The goal is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in regard to wages.
This occurs, first, through the system of financial obligation in the case of long-term unemployment, and secondly, by the restricted right of employees regarding labor rights.
The result is growing poverty along with the widening gap between rich and poor.
For a number of years, there are in Germany Food Delivery points for poor people who can not support their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid comes as a million.
Under the increased competitiveness of the German economy, there is a common case : employees with a salary so low that the state must pay the rest to get to the bare minimum to survive.
Was made public a scandal of this type related to the situation of clerks German federal parliament.
Saving measures virtually all southern states of the EU lead, no doubt, to the same situation. People, pressured by a decline abysmal social level, are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century or bad life with lousy wages on the edge of society, with the hope that some day come to the country private investment capital.
Is it necessary preguntrarse come from?
In the case in question from other EU countries, then poverty moves from one country to another or never comes, as Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians and Africans continue to work for a fraction of European wages.
This also applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media endlessly claim that the state should not provide capital to the economy, which run the economy leading to its failure.
Private equity fiercely defends the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy meddling in control.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence his selfishness in the political march and, therefore, all over the state.
In this case the answer is clearly yes.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation which manifests in the area of corruption, mutual favors in legislation that is virtually everywhere reprehensible but not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows : government ministries, a lack of financial means, charge drafting bills to private legal firms, which are often linked to the industry.
Such bills are approved after the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, not all power emanates from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but strong financial groups representing their interests.
It is obvious that liberal democracies are oriented quickly in a situation like that described Appiános in his Crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompeii : "The state had long disintegrated and administrations forcibly occupied".
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained unlawfully and help fund stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread without hindrance and the people went to the polls to vote bespoken in advance "..." there were no people with character who aspires to a position in the administration, so once because of this disorganization, the state spent eight months without consuls "..." He began to talk seriously that the only remedy for such a serious situation was the autocracy and it was necessary to choose an energetic man "... While thinking of Pompeii Appiános Caesar came to power and democracy transformed forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, just as in ancient times, is that society is based on individual benefit inconsiderate preferences regardless of common interests.
Private capital can not, in essence, to understand and claim the benefits of society.
The result is the same as it was then, a decline unprecedented elite, without performing an effort to be thoroughly reformed.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes should be sought, therefore, to the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
With respect to the current situation, you might consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal -style democracy, as defined paused, waiting for the next blow.
The really devastating fact is that current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed, and crimes against humanity, as we know in ancient history and the most recent.
The suspension of the public purchasing law is not the solution, at least not long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the Czech government will be forced to continue looking for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is, therefore, systemic.
The solution is concrete socio-political reforms, which enhance both the participation of state capital as the influence of citizens in government and to weaken the monopoly of private capital in the society for the benefit of the state.
Israel : the laboratory of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could" (No surge nada de la violencia y nada podría hacerlo), Sting en su canción Fragile y cuyo estribillo reza "Let's do not forget how fragile we are" (no nos olvidemos de lo frágiles que somos).
"If my sons did not want wars, there would be no" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, have emerged as usual reactions.
One, on the side of Israel, argues for the right of self-defense and the Palestinians typecast in the role of terrorist. The other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism by the state of Israel, Arab genocide against Palestinians and blaming Israel of state terrorism.
Do not want to focus on who is to blame for the massacres that are repeated regularly and who is the victim. At the end of the day, the citizens of Israel today, including the autonomous territories, born within the current political situation and did not experience the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to give readers a look behind the scenes, a look to see who takes advantage of the tensions dragging on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small area of land Middle East.
Some of my views are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have reached on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter, who or what group of people is the primary driver of events in modern history.
In the history of mankind in the history of the struggle for power is in the front row.
In every age can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is not so clear is whether these characters were always those who directed their steps independently or behind his throne was someone that guided their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in a time that the world's wealth concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and power involved, could not be reached in a single generation.
Of these families highlights a rich astronomically could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind do not know, but do not rule) : the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
In the 90s of XIX century bought the first news agency (Reuters) so stop associating his name with very serious criminal acts. The power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which to them always meant a strengthening.
They have major holdings in almost all central banks in the world and in those countries that are not represented, has pleaded or preparing a war : before the attack on Afghanistan were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq were 5, then to topple Gaddafi were only four, but meanwhile Russia has subject the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state central bank Bank of America of Rothschild, began during the Civil War to print money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
JFK started printing money and wanted to stay the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963, Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after trying to sue the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
His quest for world power during the years it took 1859 - 1871 to develop a plan with three world wars designed by Freemason Albert Pike, who was awarded the degree 33.
The first war was marked as objective eliminate large monarchical states in Europe, the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially in Britain, and the third is proposed to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and one billion people (such number of slaves to their welfare and enough luxury and consume so many resources), and the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution) and the final adoption of absolute powers.
The method by which the group operates from the wealthiest families, together with Rothschild, follows the dynamics of the onset of crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (ab cao order - order out of chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always involve a worsening of the situation. If not, just remember that the Fed was created to not repeat a crisis like that of 1907.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro -Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo and after that, following this, the outbreak of the First World War destroyed the Tsarist Russia with the start of the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustified from the standpoint of military and economic, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end tsarist Russia were now unnecessary) and the subsequent breakup of the great Central European power, the rule Austro -Hungarian Empire.
To set the stage for World War II, allowed the bankers and politicians create, so undercover, a conflict as a result of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, which was created optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, they simply had to serve the German Fuehrer's solution, which was strong enough and simple and pointed to blame, and build then a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority was represented and represented well the function the fifth column, that ignited the flame and caused the outbreak of the war.
By the late nineteenth century, the Rothschild Foundation promoted the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration laid the foundation for the massive immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
World War II broke out : it is difficult to know whether Hitler too pulled the rope that had bound the international bankers at first or if all he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way that war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel was created focus for a third war.
If international bankers consiguieran start it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would fall victim frontline combat, now along with the Arab population, or generally Middle Eastern Muslim.
Israel is a huge laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only within the country but also internationally. Take for example how so sharply divided supporters and opponents of Israel.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Where injustice breeds injustice in a never-ending spiral of violence, whether at the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their quest for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the people of Israel and their leaders, because, as happens in our country, the international bankers only present their candidates in elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is a typical example of fascist politician, loyal to the international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...) threaten to become a global conflict, and if we consider that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of the world's oil (the shipping corridor is only two miles wide), lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light is now the words of David Rockefeller in 1994 : "All we need is a crisis and people will agree to a new world order."
The new world order in his imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population it serves a handful of people who are part of the financial aristocracy well off.
A world in which each new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls your entire being.
" And forcing everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on his forehead, being unable to buy or sell, unless with the name of this monster or figures of his name.
One must understand : anyone with half a brain, you add the numbers on this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred sixty six '.
Argo Movie : If you put oil, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamist student demonstration occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took hostage 52 graduates.
His release would be to change the dethroned Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution to the U.S., a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration the situation offered no positive outlook : throw overboard shah not could afford it, because if he did, jeopardizing the trust of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not within reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently was further intensified with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
Diplomats imprisoned were released 444 days after the intervention of the Algerian government negotiator.
In the U.S., their fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
Failure in Iran contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" director and actor Ben Affleck thematizes an episode of this story, which garnered a small success for America.
Shortly before taking the embassy, escaped six employees of the building.
After a complicated journey, ended up in the Canadian embassy residence.
CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, got them out of Iran, for it helped a cover story bizarre point : out with Canadian passports, as members of the film crew examining the location in the country for the shooting of a sci-fi blockbuster.
Combining genres
The plan drew expert "exfiltration" Toni Mendez required collaboration with Hollywood.
For the lie seem true, was written about the film project journals, organized press conferences, the production company even had an office fictional reality.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck 's film is a unique combination of various genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller on the other, called "caper movie," the story of an episode that went well, a delusion (an example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
In the film combine moods. Sequences found by a well-documented side of Tehran. In the credits sequence is emblematic of the era photographs of events that were depicted in the same way in the movie, there are not many differences in this respect.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And, scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions: men in suits who analyze the situation in the table, in the halls of the office, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been teased, has become a director respectable and their mode of action is no longer the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature, after "Gone Baby, Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, Affleck 's first film in which the action takes place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed the old movie directors over Hollywood standards.
And it shows in Affleck Argo, where Tehran is "wheel" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of true events. The introductory sequence embassy takeover is impressive synoptic capacity, at the same time, conveys the emotion of confusion and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story moves forward.
Affleck and colleagues achieved a similar effect on the fictional scenes (impostor team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The manager had to accept the fact that a story told does not offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And he manages quite well. Sometimes I add something to reality here so not everything goes as elegant (the scene where the crisis looms in Tehran airport, diversion of a call to America and the unbridled pursuit her trail become crazy).
The weakness of Argo is the control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman play a very funny how Hollywood contributors, although their characters deserved more space and are far from alone in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck film loses some dramatic stroke, but it is a film that can be followed with moderate interest, value realization and retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But it collapses, it will be difficult.
As an evocation of a true story and as proof of what can be exaggerated notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret service, is sufficient.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
Www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which each year presents a survey on most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the contest on "the Rules or absurd ideas EU Workshop".
"We came up after the last event, the EU intends to adopt a quota of 40 percent women in management positions in large European companies," said Patrik Nacher Právo, the organizer of the survey.
Among the nominees absurdities is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of unifying the insurance policies for men and women.
Until now, women have outstripped the best prices on life insurance because they represent a lower risk objectively.
"Other amazing ideas EU workshop may be proposed by the people through the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013 "reported Nacher.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of bio- fuel, as a result, damage the environment, another ban is the use of mercury thermometers life only because they contain a small amount of a hazardous substance or shadow guideline the size of chicken coops, which has contributed to considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
It has criticized the factual ban using the term "butter spreads" or withdrawal of the classic bulb trade.
A banana quality should have a length of 14 inches.
The apparatus of the Union takes these decisions often under the pressure of either commercial or industrial lobby, whose petitions in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claimed the demands of their banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher quality bananas in the EU should have a length of at least 14 inches and could not present "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended himself by saying that it only seeks to harmonize national rules do not homogenized so far, which only complicated their marketing.
The rules refer to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states have eased on the basis that the existing policy entails a waste of food.
The candidate to win the poll might be prescribing the EU last year according to which inflatable balloons sold is obligatory warning that children under 8 are not allowed to inflate without adult supervision.
The EU was referring here to an American study according to which, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of infant death by asphyxiation.
Also force a similar restriction applies to the use of flutes by children up to 14 years.
Weird Occurrences born even in our country
Equally absurd is the Regulation on European officials : anyone who has any official role in the EU can not use the name of Macedonia. To not offend the sensibilities of Greece, talk of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the Association of Laissez Faire liberal economists, nominated in the survey, including some absurd proposals mentioned above, the prescription of the Union on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state.
The EU sets the maximum volumes of supplies of food that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the EU.
After the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the volume set for canned mushrooms, which posed a threat of substantial fines.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of pay to those countries without access to the sea and the idea of giving a grant to apply for grants.
This kind of ideas emerged in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage by not having sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation, "he said in the fall of 2004, the then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
I argued with the fact that in our country there was much cereal and, as a result of intervention buying calls, the state had warehouses full and had to export.
According to Pallas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was prepared to help the Czech Republic organized a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant for a grant was given to municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel Nemec (US- DEU). Specifically, is intended for writing applications for subsidies from Brussels.
EU : The requirements are an exception rare
The guidelines of the member states are often the target of criticism, the efforts of EU regulations and likewise a more effective operation and development across the Union deserve rather, according to experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the biggest problem is, for example, the payment of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that member states have succeeded in budget negotiations.
The Czechs also strikes a chord in the same way as other countries of the Union, the struggle for the right to the appellation of origin of its traditional products, but our country has not always been victorious in these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with German and Austrian, successfully defended the designation of origin of Olomouc curd, but they had to rename the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the nineteenth century, and was renamed "tuzemák".
Only products made from distilled sugar cane rum can be called, but not those made from sugar beets.
In the official list of protected designations of origin in the EU, along with feta and gorgonzola cheeses known worldwide, marzipan German city Lübeck or Parma ham, already cookies eg Karlovy Vary, Pohořelice carp and Trebon and even the Žatec hop variety.
As protected EU maras may be proud of the Pardubice gingerbread waffles and Hořice v Podkrkonoší.
People want to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Mr. Senator, how he came to stand for election for president?
At about being senator president.
If our country was all good, then do not submit my candidacy.
But I can no longer bear to watch is stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves go unpunished, increasing taxes and retirement ages.
I had no ambitions to be political.
When I see something I like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I have already forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to introduce as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon put on the road to the presidency.
Not giving back to those who voted?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency of the results depended on Senate elections.
Later I pointed out that if elected senator, present my candidacy for the presidency.
But my goal is not the function, the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas.
So I need maximum influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that criticized at the bar or in front of the television, but trample anyone who wants to start a change.
To this are added the media, you discredit and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
IM dice that he was sobornado to journalists that he been adviser Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
We present thesis presidential fight financial and criminal responsibilities of politicians and property declaration above twenty million.
This should change the law.
As president does not have this competition and only a whole Senate may propose laws.
How do you want to solve?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group to guide the craft was recognized as autonomous, and we got it.
The problem is politics: if someone comes in with a good proposal, either right or left, is rejected on purpose and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without pigeonholing or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply.
Do you consider yourself more of a man of the right or left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left.
For me it does not matter, either a little left or a little right.
What matters is that we get on.
I do not care if someone is right or left, I want to bring people together.
Openly support any solution always good, regardless of whether the proposal comes from KSČM or ODS and, likewise, will be against bad ideas.
It is said in jest when you say it is populist.
But it is not proving what you say?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you try to approach them.
Some may call it populism, but all proposals of which I speak and work in the world and known experts talk about them.
But without the support of Parliament are only slogans.
And it can not survive in the long-term policy.
Or do you think if you go to people and talk to them, get, for example, a criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my part to get it.
If elected president, there would be no problem in hosting a live broadcast on TV in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they do not want.
If there is a strong character pointing disputes, can put pressure on the political scene.
Take for instance the direct election of the president, who has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I say I'm just a fan, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my views and ideals I try to find allies.
I just started in politics and try to get as much support as possible for my program.
I try to get things done myself, but if it does not work out, in six years I will leave and return to the private sector.
Sounds a bit like Okamura out to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know a person does not do anything, so I visited a number of personalities known, if perhaps be encouraged to apply for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but refused because he had too much work.
For my part, at least I have supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, which brought to light the frauds with light heating oil.
I applied on the basis that people are really unsatisfied, I'm in the balance.
Sixty percent of the population went to the polls and those who did, voted for the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so that will be difficult to achieve changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming his own party?
I have not seen because I have no time for it to check the unblemished past each potential party members, nor do I have money.
No I have no money to campaign for the presidency, in my mind there are only 20,000 crowns transparent.
Do not have money?
Talk Property statements, how is yours?
I estimate my private property about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land valued at 25 million, a flat worth ten million, another apartment valued at eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and valued Škoda Superb in a million, and the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my childhood dream. I always liked James Bond, who was driving the car, was gallant with women and, at the same time fighting the evils and injustices.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, his property is valued at 60 million and has no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but do not want to put too much money from you.
Not very convincing.
I have not 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
In the campaign I have already 2.5 million.
The fact that it has no sponsor shows that there is much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
The cover campaign expenses essentially you receive by way of salary senator.
But I could not live on it. For example, I could not pay my child's English School, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I only want to make money, then I would not stand as candidate.
So your business will to live?
Did not you say before that it would stop this activity?
This has nothing to do with a salary greater.
As promised, in part I left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement spring.
People want to be the Samaritan who would save the republic.
But I also need to live for something.
How much used to earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I keep winning.
If I was president, then let business.

The architectural firm MVRDV shows that not only are real adventures in the head - in the example Spijkenisse library and the recently completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, has a futuristic look, and finally there is something interesting to do," says Lisette Verhaig a passerby who goes by the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large company located near the library, says : "In addition, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why do we need a library today.
Everyone Internet, tablets and electronic books.
No one gets for nothing in those old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom community located just outside Rotterdam barely worth a brief visit, has the dubious honor of having claimed a record for forgetting.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this embarrassing situation, a few years ago decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictional bridges depicted on euro banknotes in the form of decorated concrete thumbnails.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so policy makers decided that there was only one possibility to improve the statistics :we had to build a library!
Winy Maas, the Dutch architectural firm MVRDV, a master in the art of bar charts and responsible for building fun at the same cynical, took the subject with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the year contest 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury looked around puzzled and shrugged, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words : " Dear fellow citizens :
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books Spijkenisse, the so-called ` Boekenberg ' ".
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros rises in the space provided.
This is part of the revitalization project, complete with underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of apartment buildings and townhouses.
In early November, the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
Thus, the small town devoid of history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a pedestrian area and a town hall postmodern incredibly ugly after one intuit white façade rather a dairy, now has a work of architecture contemporary.
But mostly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long road to Book
The first impression is that it is a haven of books under a cheese.
It is true that there is an elevator that takes us right into the center of this mountain, but true lovers of reading space and do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of his climb to the top.
Fully glazed interior is bright and easy to cover with sight, clinker flooring and elegant lamps unequivocally support the public status of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
Looking up display can reach the park benches, dogs and children playing soccer.
And everywhere, books and more books.
"Normally the bookshelves are arranged along the front and in the center opens a huge dark room, usually often be uncomfortable and impersonal" says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to shake down the classic spatial configuration and take the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used : in the middle are the offices, the library, the Internet, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention black shelves that assume the functions of wall cladding, parapet and railing at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strangers.
Even the architects and civil engineers more daily shake their heads when they hear of this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the city of Spijkenisse.
And that's how one day, on a farm Friesland, we stumbled upon the right product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands using a plastic woven few millimeters thick as a base to hold the roots of crops.
This material is cheap and efficient.
This tissue lasts two seasons and then discarded.
Library for this fabric was pressed for the first time in such quantities to obtain plates four inches thick.
With the heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes dark material, homogeneous and strong smelling a mixture of new car and sneaker.
After 105 steps leads to the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous path almost 500 meters around the mountain reward awaits us : from the coffee shop not only has a fantastic view of the city, but it also can enjoy a tasty Dutch croquettes and planted ficus in large pots.
They create a friendly environment whilst maintaining the proper humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Believe it or not given its large glass surfaces, the building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
The heating and cooling required are obtained from geothermal energy.
Despite the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun shines only for a few hours inside.
The massive wooden trusses located transverse to the glass facade serve to provide shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is up to the shutters.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptic sector worker Information Technology, and has dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig also been there.
Similarly, traditional Chinese medicine professor Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She describes the "Boekenberg" as the "soul late" Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration which took place a few weeks ago, we invited all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book from his private collection.
This form is to be filled, for the moment, the optical gaps a library that does not yet have its full file, and currently has 70,000.
The concept has deepened.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says the architect Winy Maas.
"I think with our initiative now all people have a certain bond with this building.
Everyone knows that the book is part of the library.
While only be there for garnish.
Thus, MVRDV has achieved a success in that discipline reigns in specialized jargon is called "creating an identity."
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of literary history.
Regardless of how young and uneducated it may be.
Finally a starting point to form su identidad.
Szabo : "The Germans must play a greater role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S. relations. US - Europe, this places Berlin in a diplomatic position quite tricky.
Deutsche Welle : Earlier this week, Germany hinted that he would vote against the proposal to grant to the Palestinian statehood UN observer.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo : Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, because of the special relationship between the country with Israel, Germany should beware.
But at the same time I think not endorse the U.S. position.
Germany wanted to show his independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising that took place in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when the issue was to establish a no-fly zone.
This has been finally declared by NATO.
Is it hard to Germany take a clear stand when major international issues at stake?
Yes, it is.
This is because right now is shifting its foreign policy away from a policy -led, as it were, by the United States and focusing on German foreign policy.
And what matters even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but are not used to.
I think they are still probing what their role, but they have already begun the journey to a foreign policy "normal".
A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Britain.
What does it mean specifically a foreign policy "normal" from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is prepared to defend positions different from those of the United States and its European partners.
I think the German foreign policy is a strong motivation in economic policy, ie exports and in their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are somewhat different from those of other great powers and that is why Germany must protect their interests.
Do these economic interests have influenced the position taken with respect to the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason you must be careful and not alienating Arab public opinion nor the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give much importance since it is not a totally one-sided.
However, they play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Germany Has undermined his relationship with EE. UU. to abstain from voting on important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I think in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position has a huge degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not think there has been a break as drastic as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has achieved thus garner some respect.
At the end of the day, all this has done nothing but prove that it is a country that are serious international actor whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different views about the Palestinian initiative.
However, EE. UU. has been shown clearly in favor of a veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between EE. UU. and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of U.S. domestic politics.
I think the Obama administration secretly shows great insight into the European position.
But because of the political situation that exists here, it is clear that the government can not publicly defend that position.
I think the real difference of opinion does not really have the scope attached to it.
If we analyze the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy developed.
Is it hard to reconcile Germany close relations with Israel and the United States on one side, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there is a coherent and consistent European policy, but not the case.
Therefore, do not have the opportunity to be part of a superior being, but must push things from their own position.
That is precisely what we are doing now with the euro.
I think in the future Germany will assume a leadership role when it comes to force Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course this is not easy for Germany, either simply by the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a tricky issue.
But I think the Germans have understood that they must play the role of independent figure.
Germany Will sees itself in the role of major international player? Do you want to actually take a leading role Germany?
Or maybe it is still difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet been used, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a bigger role.
If we observe the Euro crisis, for example, we see that whenever Germany is positioned as a major player sets off certain anti-German feelings.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and nobody wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Viewed this way, Germany is in a position much more difficult for the United States.
You must show a positive attitude towards the different neighbors and opinions and that's not easy.
The influence of EE. UU. in European politics increasingly decreases, but the EU does not cover the gap at the moment, who is then?
The Germans will have no choice but to assume a greater role.
Even if you do not like, if they find unpleasant or makes them an even more unpopular people, c'est la vie!

"Brand Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a brand known worldwide, and Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this name hides a designation officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it is protected while the real eponyms not file a claim.
And even then it is not clear that they are going to give the reason.
"Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Each week comes to my table a new case.
Imitators just add a couple of letters to register their brands.
In this way, becomes Lu Gucci -Gucci and Prada instead of Prada- Kny recorded.
German companies also copied legally in the same way as has happened to the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a file in the seats keeping the trademark office in Beijing.
The September 14, 2010 a Chinese company applied to register the mark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name also served as fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions at it to copy and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In big cities there are multi-storey department store dedicated exclusively to selling fakes.
However, cases are Pattloch other. On behalf of its customers, he struggles against the fact that the trademark office officially granted to Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Pai Ming" or mark companion.
The word comes from the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan"
referring to women who have "caught" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It is detrimental to the business, you have to fight it" requires Pattloch.
"The brand does not hold water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage to the image is huge."
The financial losses and legal costs in the sectors concerned are millionaires, especially in the case of luxury flagship products.
According to the market analysis firm CLSA, with a volume of 15,000 million euros per year, China is, in size, the third luxury goods market and growing at a faster pace.
However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the trademark registration is complicated and it takes a lot of money.
Processes can be extended up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had been so long that the purpose of the application name had already become a "market reality".
"If the plaintiff has bad luck, maybe even have to pay money to the plagiarist because the process has damaged the brand of it in China," said Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphics.
In 2009 Daimler - Benz lost a lawsuit against the manufacturer Sany construction machinery, the company was taken over recently by the German manufacturer Putzmeister concrete pumps.
So today the Chinese can continue to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The buyer of Volvo, Geely, used at first a blue and white logo reminiscent greatly BMW, the matter was settled in court and Geely had to modify it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer in China lost against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore which represented a crocodile logo looking in the direction opposite to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing in 2010 acknowledges that have struggled due to lack of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "labor emergency situation returned to normal."
Thus, the amount of unprocessed claims process has been reduced by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending.
To combat this costs a lot of money
As is usual in China, the numbers are striking.
CTMO last year registered more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record, and means that China leads the tenth consecutive year the list of new registrations worldwide, says the trademark office.
It seems that this also applies to the number of valid logos, rising to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011 they bagged 1.800 million yuan in royalties.
Put another way, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
To combat this costs a lot of money, as evidenced by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For over seven years the group fight in court against a Chinese imitator.
While the Germans have failed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the imitator has been able to ensure Chinese rights over the trademark Freudenberg.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the last names are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also dismissed the people of Munich.
In the following two instances have given reason to Freudenberg, but the other party is still fighting today.
We must be very careful
Now the case has reached the doors of the High Court, which remains pending.
Wentzler hopes to favorably resolve the issue and praised the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that "the process is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate the internal costs, the company has had to file review records of up to one hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Freudenberg five years ago offered to the opposing party a ' six-figure sum in euros "in order to reach an amicable agreement, but was unsuccessful.
"This shows how much we care," said Wentzler.
The dangers lurking in the Far East threaten even affect Europe
specifically if there imitators ensure trademark rights unprotected.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany tried to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather goods.
Group has long abandoned this trade area, however managed to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer recommend Pattloch German companies are very cautious of doing business with China.
Not enough to rely on international law trademark rights, but you have to do is "China also record anything that might be eligible for protection," as pointed Wentzler.
Otherwise, the issue can be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, in case you lose the last assault Freudenberg your particular battle, then have to pay the license fees opposing party by name, as explained Wentzler.
That or we expel single segment of the market.
World Day against AIDS : dance, sing, help
In Heidelberg Imbongi choir rehearses and rejoice Swaziland AIDS orphans
The story of a link can be overcome much more than 8,733 miles away.
First you start with the dance : cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heels and loafers look compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then begin to rise slowly singing voices (alto, bass, tenor and soprano), swirling, to dull and following one another.
And Fiete Hopf, the director of 29 years, threatening to slip out of their boxes almost trying to put order with their energetic and gentle gestures.
It's Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology at Heidelberg Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
Have also arrived fifty singers, aged 23 and 69, from the human geneticist to the householder.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice choir has a different text and also in a foreign language little known : the Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations program to combat AIDS worldwide there are approximately 34 million people infected with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
Over 40% of the population and is HIV positive.
Voices for Africa Partnership in Germany found sponsors for 180 AIDS orphans Esitjeni village.
Seventy of them attend school.
By 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution covers the school fees, uniform and will guarantee you a hot meal a day in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi in Zulu means "storyteller" the "panegirista."
In this room no one can speak the language fluently Bantu, but singing do know.
For ten years this choir rehearses songs in this soft language that sometimes manages transport them to their place of origin : South Africa.
At 8,733 miles away in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a town called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this choir German.
Forty percent is infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some even in simple huts of mud and straw, a large part of them are children.
Over 300 and not have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the AIDS infection rate highest and lowest life expectancies in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population frowns circumcision, a practice that has been shown to reduce by half the risk of contagion.
Over 40% of the people of Swaziland are carriers immunodeficiency virus, and die with more than thirty years has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the choir discovered this hidden population, but mostly what they saw were many children on the streets that lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing : food, clothing and formation.
Untitled school, the possibilities in a poor country are but few.
At first it was only a few particular commitment which made it possible for a child off to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later founded the association choir "Voices for Africa" which since then has been engaged professionally AIDS orphans Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial STDs are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
, Viral STDs are the most common AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies are among the ETS -borne parasites.
What are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur more frequently in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany are caused by sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults sexually transmitted diseases are the most common infections chlamydia, trichomonas, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (yeast) and gonorrhea.
The HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively small, however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections recorded in this group.
Among the young, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections occur in young people between 15 and 25 years.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are compulsorily notifiable.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled its number of 1,697 cases in 2001-3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections remains a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2,700 cases.
This is one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is an STD?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, abdominal pain and blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or other symptoms cause and therefore not detected.
How can you protect?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer one hundred percent protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt and infection by physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend to have regular checkups, especially if you change sexual partners frequently.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and may avoid any late consequence.
Through partnerships, grants, and, last but not least important, the fees charged by the choir for their performances in Germany, come to raise enough money.
"In total we sent ya Esitjeni approximately € 200,000," says Annette proud Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini woman confident leadership skills and manage money sent from Germany.
It ensures that orphans find good accommodation, for example with a grandmother.
The "gogos" as referred to in Zulu older women are the pillars of the people.
Some have up to 14 orphans in their care, they offer a place to live and take care of children to go to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman, as are two cooks who are responsible for everyday cooking for 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
Furthermore, "Voices of Africa" has launched a sewing school, has built two houses and, in collaboration with the American health organization PSI, has brought many of the villagers have undergone an HIV test.
This is not obvious, since, although it is clear that this disease across the country, not usually talk openly about it.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country in which the king is officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its opulent lifestyle filled with excess.
Polygamy in place of democracy.
This way of life is not officially accepted is largely responsible for the spread so fast that has experienced the HIV virus in the last decades.
But also due to the many seasonal workers who travel the country from one side to another and carry it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, " in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are rarely used.
It is another culture here only accept skin to skin contact. "
To promote cultural exchange, the choir travels Imbongi every two or three years by South Africa singing songs about melancholy, fighting spirit, hope and trust in blacks, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still reminiscent of the apartheid era.
A white bus full of singing songs in a language of blacks, both recognition not only brings a great atmosphere and great joy, but also has managed to snatch a few tears to some other rabid frontier soldier.
Their journey takes them forever to Esitjeni, where singers visit sponsored children.
Although this small town just appear on maps, in the river valley is well known Ezulweni.
"Come to Esitjeni, there shines the light," the locals said.
And after covering the 8,733 miles in a straight line back to Heidelberg until rehearsal rooms filled street singers Bergheimer marking time, you realize that it is also possible to see your light shine from there.
Messenger : NASA finds ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice is likely to have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the U.S. space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there are also ice water as it follows three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe had found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently shadowed has formed a layer of ice.
It seems that it is at least 30 inches and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water comes presumably from comets or, most probably, of asteroids that once collided with Mercury.
Nobody relates the discovery of ice with the possibility that life exists on the planet, says lead researcher Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings may help clarify how they got water and other components of life elsewhere in the solar system.
By completely unnoticed by the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix is dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
Occasionally send images to Earth : small windows to the vastness of space.
The image is from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck.
The eight planets in our solar system, and the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is not a "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which they appear endless generations of stars : the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, but more difficult to recognize is the pink color of the stars "newborn".
This star-forming region, called unromantic way by scientists W5, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia, a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This shimmering image of a star in extinction was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut -shaped ring is composed of material that the star spits in the process of extinction.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
The NASA Spitzer Space Telescope took this picture of the galactic star-forming region.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known by the nickname of "The Seven Sisters", are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can see the colors better.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has earned him the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image results in a spectacular color.
This rising star could be captured in all its glory for the first time by infrared detectors Spitzer.
Saturn and its rings : how they originated remains one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
This is probably the remains of one of the moons of Saturn that disappeared without trace 4,500 million years ago.
One of the largest and most crisp photographs taken by the Hubble telescope : the Whirlpool Galaxy.
Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula found several thousand light years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name comes from the Latin term Trifid "trifidus" (split into three), as a dark dust lanes divide the hot heart of this star-forming region into three lobes.
In the constellation Ophiuchus astronomers were able to photograph the evidence of cosmic carom : to 400 million light years from Earth the nuclei of two galaxies merging process pounce towards each other to finish irretrievably crashing.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it by the nickname of Southern Pinwheel.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula located 1,400 light years is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and one hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles to be found in a house.
This image was created from optical and X-ray images made by different telescopes.
Displays a ring of black holes located 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273, served for a time as a model for the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
This nebula is the group 's brightest young stars of our Milky Way.
This star-forming region consistently produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars associated with the Rosette Nebula, also continuously new star arise, at 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole still no dust, gas only.
The researchers speculate that formed shortly after the big bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen could find.
Our window on the universe : the largest telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used a year later for stargazing.
Since then, the optical telescope mirrors has not stopped growing and images we offer are becoming more depth.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope located at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
Its mirror, in the picture, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA. UU., Stands the Large Binocular Telescope.
This allows observation of the cosmos through two mirrors, each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is enormous - just the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite ello, reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
The drawback of this construction is cheaper than the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so that the mobility is limited.
The Hobby- Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its uniqueness is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a diameter of comparatively smaller mirror, this capacity is comparable to that of the telescopes of the world's largest mirror.
Using the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life.
The telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI for short) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing power.
View the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can also light the mid-infrared spectrum.
The ESO also host the so-called E -ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or European Extremely Large Telescope).
Cover primary mirror 42 meters and will comprise a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 is not expected to take pictures.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These include two mirrors, each having a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which with them exploring the sky with the Subaru Telescope aid and IRTTF.
At Mauna Kea is planned to build a new telescope daunting and mirror with a diameter of thirty meters.
This is an image of what it would be.
However, the most important of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.
From the April 24, 1990 sends images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope looking for extrasolar planets, especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that since the beginning of his mission had been located 1,235 candidate planets.
In the image you see the final preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The telescope James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space aboard an Ariane 5-2018.
The primary mirror of the Hubble Space has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will seek the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the Big Bang.
The researchers based on the assumption that at the south pole of Mercury also no ice.
However, there is little evidence, as the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the North Pole.
For decades radar measurements suggest the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the probe Messenger (2004), the first to orbit around Mercury, now scientists are certain that it is.
Drinking butter daily and live 168 years
South of Azerbaijan many people manage to achieve biblical age.
There exists even a museum dedicated to longevity.
A search of footprints in a country where people of 97 years are still considered young.
South of Azerbaijan many people manage to achieve biblical age.
There exists even a museum dedicated to longevity.
A search of footprints in a country where people of 97 years are still considered young.
The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus moving noisily through the winding road that passes by wooded hills, large rivers and the simple homes of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that is in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, and from here the Iranian border is only a few kilometers.
Here live the "Talyshi" a town that does not know much, except that perfectly mastered Persian and Azeri and are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts perhaps too solid architecture designed in the Soviet era and does not seem to fit at all in a mountainous landscape so picturesque.
European tourists come to this place just because the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To cover the 323 miles between both towns, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The staggering wealth enjoyed by the country thanks to the Caspian Sea oil has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what you need to have to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May to celebrate the Eurovision Song Contest and the next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
It is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the lives of eight dozen talyshis the place that have more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
One of his sons died at age 136 years
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the Müslümov Şirali shepherd, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate to certify it.
And if we consider that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that age is pretty suspicious Müslümov.
"Born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973", explains Fatulayeva.
He was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently still had time to devise a daughter at the age of 136 years.
Have Şirali Müslümov wrong then in his age in a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this inhabitant of Central Asia.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live very old people," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men".
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide evidence about the age especially there is no general registrar.
Everyday glasses filled with melted butter
It is a fact that, in a surprisingly frequent, the people of the region located around Lerik typically reach biblical age.
At present there are 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why live here in the south, many elderly?
The tour guide Mugimzadeh Azerbaijani Farid explains that it is ' special genes talyshis.
The museum's director, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in the power.
However, from a nutritional standpoint, it just seems logical that a diet rich in calories Talyshi, who love meat, especially bread and dairy products and many of them also drink daily a glass of melted butter as healthy.
Is she the natural lifestyle that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik Mirzayeva Rubaba lives.
In his 97 years is relatively young for what is customary in these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, living in a simple wooden house typical of the whole Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, moving tirelessly in a huge tub of butter.
Eight people living under one roof, including a son and a daughter Mirzayeva, both became grandparents while.
Also jump from one side to the other two small children.
In the kitchen preparing tea for guests, serving tea in glasses with curved shape typical.
Mirzayeva teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the scarf hides two long braids of dark hair reveals her son proud.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so I have never been dropped and has kept its color.
"I have not ever used a shampoo" says Mirzayeva.
The pension is enough to live
From always eaten alone it produced on his own farm : tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my entire life I have never gone to the grocery store to a supermarket.
Then we talk about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the period after the Second World War.
However, everything went back to normal when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
Such propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of a woman.
However, in Azerbaijan they profess to worship the father figure of the nation, who runs his country like a dictator, knows no bounds.
He remained in power until 2003, when he ceded to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva cobra 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) in monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps the gray son of Mirzayeva is right : "In our culture the elderly are highly respected."
They live in a big family, they are loved, they receive all necessary care and are happy.
As if that were not reason enough to stay alive many years...
The Constitution lack the expression "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Manifestations that rival each other in Cairo demonstrate the tremendous division that has gripped the country.
The future constitution with sharia as the basis, it is highly controversial.
Egyptian President spared no pathos.
" We must overcome the transition.
And that happens is my responsibility before the people and before God, "he said on public television.
His speech was directed at all the people, especially the Coptic Christians, liberals, Muslims and secular Enlightenment.
All of them, until now hopelessly mired in a confusing opposition are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi said, almost apologetically, has had to temporarily override the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand their own "in order to save the revolution."
However, neither the Egyptians nor the world know very well what this 61 year old engineer with a doctorate degree from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you mean to deprive of power to the judiciary?
In fact, the 234 items, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly predominantly composed of 100 members Islamists in an evening meeting lasting 15 hours, are truly disturbing.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that the case is based on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what does this "principle"?
This was and is still open to interpretation and it seems that the Islamists will take this vague formulation, and the legal discretion carries with it, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This is at least suggesting a new article added : in all matters relating to Sharia requires consultation with Al- Azhar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It need not be so, but this may mean that the clergy control the legislation, which - in fact - would result in incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During the dictatorship of Mubarak served these courts to exercise a crackdown on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As prescribed in the draft, the state has to protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "to promote morals and values."
It is so vague formulation in legal terms with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of the film and literature.
Straight Talk is not nothing but censorship.
Certainly no article explicitly states equality between men and women.
Instead another prohibits offend or slander the Prophet Mohammed and his legacy.
However, it is unclear what is an offense and how it should be punished.
Equally questionable is the formulation which prohibits "offending people"
Is it enough a caricature of President or a joke about a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for signature and, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to referendum.
"The revolution has come"
For weeks now, the opposition is closing ranks against the superiority of the Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in a rare harmony on Friday afternoon in Tahrir Square in Cario and vowed to derail the Act before it can enter into force.
"The revolution is back and end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbahi, which ranks third in the list of the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, stated that the draft constitution should be "in the dustbin of history".
Through Twitter followers accused the Mursi of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy".
"When convening the referendum will go to his palace and it will bring down," says Jasser Said opponent.
"We're not tired, the blood of our brothers has not been purged," the media quoted Egyptian opposition politician Ali Chaled.
And several judges announced that they wished to monitor the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for holding a counter, just in case not in Tahrir Square but after prayer across the Nile, at the University of Cairo.
Many women veiled and Salafists supporters took part in it, shouting "the people demand the application of the divine law."
Mursi demanded to "cleanse the country", while proclaiming : "the Koran is our constitution".
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all started, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Clearly Mursi supporters did not want to risk something like that happened.
The brothers said that both Muslims who oppose the draft constitution as supporters of it have voiced their opinions loud and clear.
Now it would be time to let the people decide at the polls which direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists is guaranteed majority.
"The expression ' human rights ' does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this constitutional process should actually forced to have lasted until February and have included all social forces.
This 48 year old lawyer specializing in human rights and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face a trial for the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because I share his ideology, but because for him human rights are inseparable.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the phrase ` human rights ' does not even appear in the new constitution,"he laments in a conversation with the newspaper"Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of the powers of the three branches Mursi State made this lawyer resigned.
The measures are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and take Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is to abolish" laments Saeda.
However, democracy can not function without the civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could backfire.
One protester in Tahrir warns: "you are conceiving a monster that you can not control."
The Norwegian rakfisk : more smelly fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success bears some relationship to their greed by a very smelly fish?
Take a series of over- cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty clothes and wet football.
Leave it there for a week.
You can then smell the aroma of rakfisk paralyzing one of the delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It snowed. The scenery is spectacular and the smell, always present in the air.
The salted trout rakfisk is left to ferment in water for smelly depending on what you prefer, as a year.
As it becomes more dark and cold, Norwegians flock to a festival that is held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this delicacy as, so to speak, captivating.
"It is eaten raw and then drinking a glass of aquavit for a drink," says Havard Halvarsen, City firefighter who is also known as the "General Rakfisk" which is responsible for organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish which is kept in small cubes and sipping a drink significant amounts of drinking.
"Some people like more the aquavit that rakfisk" says Havard.
The drink can kill the smell.
I try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing near the nose, not bad, not unlike a lot of sushi that has traveled a few miles by bus.
The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty whipped Norway and in which, before there was refrigeration, fish was kept during the fall submerged in water and salt in sealed barrels.
Later, in winter, when it is well fermented, removed, and obviously his senses inactive due to alcohol, eat.
Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is increasing rapidly, over 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive system of social services.
A stream of people of Sweden, the old rival and until not too far richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, an essential, though quite smelly, Norway 's past.
It is among the most expensive items you can buy.
But in fact, everything is expensive. A glass of beer or a sandwich cost you a whopping 10 € ($ 14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like to do so.
Here people are still reluctant to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist peppered shot and killed 77 people, among whom were men, women and children.
Instead, refer to the shooting as "the event of July 22."
A lot of Norwegians believe costs them in their peaceful country one of their own was able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of the current wealth of Norway is growth, since the early 70's, one of the oil and gas world's largest.
"But oil is not the only reason we do so well," says Anna, our waitress, while passing trays rakfisk and, with her long blond hair and amazing blue eyes, represents the image of the Norwegian welfare.
"We are, as you say, people cautious."
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We do not like to brag, do not like the glitz".
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution, all but a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone had wasted money over the years that preceded the financial crisis worldwide, Norway kept the wallet securely closed.
"While we can ski in winter and hiking in summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk" he adds with a jaunty laugh.
I'm in the snow lining up to eat something, I've had enough rakfisk.
Now elk burger is definitely something different and quite delicious to savor.
But at night, becomes the smelly fish.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many venues in which is held rakfisk dinner where diners voted the best fish, or perhaps the more tests the nostrils.
A live television connected to a presenter wearing bow tie and surrounded rakfisk dishes.
It seems the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor -Juergen?"
"Here is our score, Havard."
There is laughter and applause.
A man fell off his chair, perhaps overcome by the aquavit.
Or perhaps those fumes all that fish.
Mexico : Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start
As the incoming president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take up his post, the BBC's Will Grant, discusses the challenges that will face the new president and the different expectations of the population.
The Mexico City traffic is especially bad today.
In a city that, in the best of circumstances by itself is already congested, has installed a fence on Monday steel cut several of the main roads leading to the city and that is causing massive chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not to prevent the workers to reach their place of work, but prevent protesters could reach the parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, presidential band will take over the management of the nation.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico has been getting good economic performance during the government of Felipe Calderon, but the country is immersed in a war against narcotráfco that has claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a strong commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Peña Nieto said earlier this week by President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal."
Before hobnob with the President of the USA, the previous political experience of Mr. Pena was as governor of his home state of Mexico.
A heavily populated state with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital Opinions on the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
An honest man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, is remembered fondly.
Residents attribute the growth of tourism merit in place and construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive by one of the new roads of Mr. Peña Nieto, which is a huge improvement over the roads cracked and full of potholes that were rehabilitated.
You can also see his name plates at the entrance of a modern sports hall and a stunning interactive museum on climate change.
"We hope that he gets to make a real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, deputy party of Mr. Peña Nieto, the PRI.
"Particularly in regard to safety and economy, we expect the interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Deputy Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations of Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also rejects the characterization that the opposition does lack of essence of the new president.
" He's very honest, very committed and excellent vision of the country.
It is a great statesman, and, above all, is a good listener. "
However, across the state that is not the impression that many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobblestone streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under elevated highway sections is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also tough and urban.
Earlier this year, called for the intervention of the military to help in the fight against drug gangs that operate in neighborhoods and violence against women is particularly acute.
In a desert land, next to a garbage dump, have been abandoned in just the last two years the bodies of dozens of murdered women.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico as Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a rate much higher than that of Ciudad Juarez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with murder of innocent women.
Critics say Mr. Peña Nieto, in the best case, which failed to address the problem of femicide while he was in office.
Most critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a house of concrete, deteriorated typical neighborhood, Irinea Buendia has to make efforts to hold back tears as he shows me pictures of his deceased daughter, Mariana Moon.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered.
"When I got home, it seemed as if he had cleaned the body," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
"There were signs that he had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared."
While his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana viewed from the walls, along with a cross that reads a single word: Justice.
Yet that is exactly what the family says was denied.
" State authorities have treated me like an old gossip, a troublemaker, one whiner.
What they want is that you simply accept what they say and shut up ".
"But that can not be so when there have been so many irregularities and negligence," he says.
The presidential sash that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by an enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico for the past six years and the new president has promised to give priority during his tenure.
"I hope it's the same kind of president was when he was governor," said PRI Deputy Olvera Bravo Valley.
Yet that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not report abuse, say prosecutors
Prosecutors seek to address allegations of abuse of Bradley Manning during his stay in prison
The trial focuses on the period of Manning in Quantico military prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that the incarceration of Manning was severe
The Army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost many opportunities to report abuse now alleges he suffered while in military custody.
During interrogation the prosecution Manning made a pre-trial hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor Ashden Fein said Commander records weekly visits unit officers that Manning received for nine months detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaint about his treatment.
The interview, which took place during a hearing held following the request of the defense to dismiss the case since his incarceration had been hard and that this course had enough punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had contemplated suicide while in custody.
The Army intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has not confirmed that Manning never was the source of information.
At Friday's hearing, Manning Fein revised with the official forms filled up after visits to Manning during his arrest in Quantico military prison where he was held in solitary confinement highest since July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers Manning would have made questions and recorded their answers.
When Friday Fein asked about the forms, Manning acknowledged that he had described the treatment that gave the guards as "excellent" and received treatment at the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms do not show any allegations of ill -treatment, even though the officers Manning asked directly about the treatment he received, said Fein.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about some issues and that the officers who visited him had talked about these problems and they had indicated that they would try, but they did not establish these issues in the registry.
"They wrote ' without incident ' (after having spoken of the problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problem," said Manning.
The judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, Manning also asked why he had not reported his treatment during the meeting held in January 2011 with a council to examine the intentions of suicide he had expressed in a form months before.
Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to get the rate reduction "injury prevention" under which he was.
The military said he had been placed under the restrictive regime, which is one degree below the possible suicide surveillance, to ensure their protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was fine and (wanted) while staying on injury prevention... to enjoy what, in my view, is a better quality of life," said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and moving to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison located at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and who once fainted from the heat.
He said that he was not allowed to know what was happening or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world just fell Arafjon Camp, to the cage," Manning said Thursday.
"I thought he would die in that cage."
Manning said that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, at least 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, some clothes and glasses.
He explained that he tried to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning said he always had a light from outside pointing to his eyes as he slept.
He said if the guards could not see his face when he turned at night, I woke up to turn around again.
Manning 's attorney in January 2011 presented a formal complaint about his treatment Manning.
Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made the statement on Thursday, according to which, one night after being forced to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico, was forced for a recount morning to stand in front desdnudo of the guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to be covered with the blanket during the count.
During questioning of the judge Friday, Manning said he could tell from the order that gave the guard that should drop the blanket he could have been covered, but acknowledged that no one had ordered her to drop.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked last night because of an attempt to show an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that could have used the elastic from his underwear or flip-flops to harm themselves but had not done so.
Manning testified that the night had been removed from his cell his underwear, his sandals and his glasses.
His lawyers are hoping that the judge has at least on the experiences he went through during his imprisonment and drastically reduce his sentence if he was convicted in the court martial, which is scheduled to begin in early year.
The defense has said that Manning is expected to plead guilty to misdemeanor charges and defend others considered too extreme.
View is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held under the rules applicable to any detainee who is under detention in Quantico maximum.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, causing illegally publishing information on the Internet, filtration of national defense information, and theft of public property or records.
If convicted of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My identity crisis Mexican - American
He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left, says Mexicans remember those difficult times
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, had just come down the esplanade and reached the immigration processing area and was completely confused.
Some signs pointing the way towards two tails : one for "Mexicans" and another for "Aliens".
I stood there a few seconds, not sure which way I should go.
Having grown up in Central California, throughout my life I've been called "Mexican".
This is ethnic shorthand, the same way my Boston friends refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italian".
More later I decided to "Mexican - American".
But this was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather, shorthand, or scripts were not necessary.
Simply was American.
I speak Spanish. Well enough to handle me in an interview in this language.
But I have no vocabulary level of a native and I can not get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and got in line for foreigners.
I thought at the time this week that the president-elect of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet President Obama.
In the day's agenda, as long as you meet the leaders of these two countries, consisted : immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was willing to talk also of Mexican economic growth, one of the reasons why right now is as likely to stay in Mexico Mexican as you venture out to go to the United States.
Want to partner with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc in North America to EU style.
Moreover, Peña Nieto vowed to fight against the drug cartels in Mexico, but gave no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced their leaders to cede half its territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, they think in centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind are everywhere.
So, at the time in which a U.S. official says anything that involves the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of its neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma were put on a war footing.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really is a challenge is the need of the more than 35 million Mexican - Americans living in the United States.
We talk about feelings?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, perhaps the parent or any of the grandparents, which he closed the door of opportunity in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile : dark skin, low educational level, from a poor village, etc..
We are their descendants and they are loyal.
Mexico in.
And even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and have had good jobs, we can not lose sight of what we are experiencing is that, the American dream, not Mexican.
It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty yes it is.
It is for the United States.
Furthermore, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We see it as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and we look over his shoulder as if we were in a lower category is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, had not gone.
And now we would not be trapped behind this curtain of silk, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States as a child, I remember that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former more solidly know who they are and this bothers seconds.
Although a citizen of the United States, it is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are part of neither.
We love hearing the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of each country, but you're not rooted to any of them.
In Mexico we are as Americans.
And in America we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to further complicate things, so I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans work as "ambassadors" of Mexico improvised, representing their interests in the United States.
We would say to our fellow Americans how fantastic presionaríamos visit that country and political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
Eso va going on.
There is too much bitterness.
And, with wage inequality, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that is a fantastic country.
I fear that the Vais getting solos with this idea, folks.
Fair enough.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they tried to Mexico for a century and a half, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still bitter about how he treated his family takes much less time.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The cease- fire between Israel and Hamas could well be a basis for peace unlikely
Can there ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Amid the usual useless arguments about who started first, lots of buildings have been reduced to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, even though the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their ancient conflict, everything around them is changing in the Middle East.
The Arab Spring has left everything to pieces like it or not, the Palestinians and Israelis have been caught in the regional uproar.
Maybe this will make the fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to believe that its deadly stalemate could desencallarse.
A war that neither lost nor gained
At first glance, optimism seems currently very difficult to justify.
Even if you keep the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, clashes this week have reinforced the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement which has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has received a good beating.
And despite having killed some of its leaders and put pressure to the 1.7 million Gazans into one of the most miserable and populous, Israel could not destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine now governed by its bitter rivals Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders might conclude that time is on their behalf.
Since Islamists are gaining influence across the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey resurgent regional power that previously had been the closest Muslim ally Israel, has espoused Hamas. Qatar has also made one of the richest and most dynamic states of the Gulf.
The jubilant Hamas members say the Islamic crescent is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where it dominates the party - militia Hezbollah through Syria, where rebels an increasingly Islamist trend could topple Bashar Assad, to Directions to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially in Israel 's southern flank, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and important Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his death in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.
In contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are first cousins of Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may arise as a protagonist that can not be excluded, even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israeli hardliners will draw the opposite conclusion.
In regards military issue, Hamas have in place.
The Iron Dome anti-missile system in Israel has shown its effectiveness and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
Israelis calmer sleep... for some time.
In terms of diplomacy, the United States is more firm than ever, many European countries also blamed Hamas for having started the latest wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, prime minister that has largely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets fired from Gaza have claimed the lives of 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, in part because it corrodes the West Bank barrier, the main piece of a territory aspiring Palestinian statehood, and protect the Jewish settlements continue to rise even though, under international law, are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined a group of even tougher line led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run up to the elections on January 22, is in a good position.
Why pamper giving these twisted Palestinian statehood?
If you really govern in the West Bank, did not shoot rockets as they have done their countrymen in Gaza?
It is better to have them behind that wall and give them a good shot if you raise your head.
Perhaps the imposition of hardliners, but the Arab Spring could alter their calculations.
Although the Islamists to take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation to Israel, his priority will be to address the internal difficulties.
The Israeli defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
Start a war with the superpower of the area hardly help new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama for a ceasefire bodes well and could be the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, deprive Palestinians of their right to self-determination involves creating a tinderbox that one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week exploded on a bus in Tel Aviv.
Repression and is undermining democracy in the Jewish state and the situation worsens demographics with increasing Arab population.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years for refusing to pay a toll diplomatic Hamas increasing.
Both sides need a push innocent bystanders.
The solution is still touting sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper : two states and the cession of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small short term, is that the ceasefire give a little extra boost to outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, you should start to curb the flow of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs outside the matter should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would do more to create a Palestinian state that the impending attempt to obtain a virtual statehood at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role when it comes to getting to bring Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term failed to present its own plan for peace.
Back in the White House, seems just as reluctant to devote their attention.
This attitude is a deplorable vision.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The plain packaging law takes effect snuff in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and body parts look ill on packs of green off, which are the same for all brands of snuff
Australian law on snuff and plain packaging, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replaced the logos and colors of the marks of an envelope of a olive off, some frightening images of body parts and illness representations sick children and babies become children of smoking parents.
Except for the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the packs, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all printed in small font.
It is the world's strictest rules applied to the packaging of snuff.
The federal government of Australia says the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating features that make this habit has glamor.
Trust Studies show that if a person has not started smoking before age 26, there is a 99% chance that never will.
"You can see that children, even at an early age, they understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through your brand," said federal Health Minister, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and that these changes will not affect too much of the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
The tobacco companies said the law would encourage black market snuff, cigarettes which would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre, the British American Tobacco in Australia.
Increase the amount of snuff that will bring counterfeiters in China and Indonesia to sell on the streets of Australia.
Other people say that their business has benefited after the passage of the law.
Sandra Ha, Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said the demand for cigarette cases and silicone covers to cover the unpleasant images of the packs had shot almost from scratch two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain 's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
Mrs. has said Zico had sold 6,000 units to wholesalers and I was expecting more stock.
"We are a good business."
According to experts, the potential barrier is the popularity of social networks among demographic sector targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising and sponsorship of sports and requiring most sellers do not put cigarettes out the snuff marketing has gone done online.
Australia has banned internet advertising to local businesses and web pages, but can not restrict on foreign sites.
"If you market as snuff and you just have this small window to promote your products online space is the most compelling in that be," said Becky Freeman, public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman was an increase in reviews on brands from "ordinary people" posted on social networking sites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders if it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video or a marketing company is behind it.
The British American Tobacco Australia said the industry focuses more on what the new rules mean that in marketing.
The industry has even paid for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic recuse themselves the new rules, these countries are saying to the World Trade Organization being unfairly restrict trade, although none of these countries has a volume significant trade with Australia.
WTO is likely that a ruling in mid- 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries considering similar laws apply in respect of packaging snuff.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce compulsory to include images on cigarette packs.
Currently are required in more than 40 countries, which include Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India is considering tougher laws.
In Australia many smokers are defiant.
" Las photographs affect on me.
Simply not move me. "
"You take the cigar and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while purchasing a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth.
"Honestly, there's only one reason I would quit smoking : for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of tight King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, indicates that uniform packs do you find most difficult to place them on the shelves.
"Normally desenvalar took an hour delivery, now took four," says Yu.
"The government should have completely banned the snuff, then, that's it, it, it's over and close the store," he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, not too bad a bit bored
During the holidays of Thanksgiving Day this year, unexpectedly had to spend five hours in an airport because the plane they were flying suffered a mechanical problem and had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had plenty of time to think about boredom.
In the voy a lie.
Spend half a day in an airport waiting to get a flight is pretty boring, even if you have to be entertaining media such as books, magazines or iPhones, not to mention the duty- free shops.
But more and more scholars and experts in child development who praise the virtues of boredom.
According to them, it is OK, we and our children, we get bored from time to time.
Bored forces the brain to find interesting options and may foster creativity.
Given that today, most of us are connected to this or that screen, do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept in good spirits boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But we'll talk about that later.
First, like many people, assumed that now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as stated by Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of "Boredom : A Lively History" ("Boredom, an animated story") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, not.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there graffiti in Latin on the boredom -century AD
We must also consider how to define boredom.
"The problem is that it is defined and discussed in many different ways," says John D. Eastwood, Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing published research and propose the idea to a discussion group formed by 100 people, Professor Eastwood and colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "desired but can not participate in an activity that fills you up".
Claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but want to do it.
He points out that there is apathy desire to do something.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the alteration of the care process, associated with low mood and a sense that time passes slowly".
Boredom may sound terribly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood said that although they can be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed feel that the problem is with them.
Sometimes we think we are bored, when what actually happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In their study "The unengaged Mind : Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues were sent to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups in the next room heard a television blaring that bore no relationship, others listened with the volume low, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group heard at low volume program was more boring than the other two groups focus cost them, but they were not sure why and attributed to boredom.
"When you try to concentrate on a difficult or interesting, impaired attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario, and one of the study's authors.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting faulty parts in a manufacturing line, a music distract you can help you not get bored."
"In fact, we now know that moving or scribbling, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat as they make that person is physically more alert".
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what is bored at some point : the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, especially boring film.
But some people are more prone to boredom than others.
To help measure, some researchers developed in the 80's a "scale of tendency to boredom."
The scale includes questions such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that interest me that I have not time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using these scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external stimulation and more varied.
But in general, teenagers are a group type who gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which they came in contact with 400 adolescents and their parents from seven to eight times a day via a pager.
He found that 32 percent of teens said that he was bored while I was in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said he was bored when I was in school.
On the other hand, the 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if current rates of boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that "adolescence is a period in which boredom reaches its highest levels", in large part because both children and adolescents are not given a lot of control over what they want to do.
So, back to my original question : is it good bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to extremes, can we expose to physical absurdities, like betting or fall into substance abuse as a way to combat it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for over two decades.
"Boredom is the way for the brain to tell you you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain does not always know what is most appropriate.
If you're bored and use that energy to play guitar or cooking, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch television, you may be satisfied in the short term but not long term.
"So, if your child is bored and give an iPad, you may no longer be bored, but have learned to entertain himself or dosed" said Professor Fenske.
And "that ability dosed applies to other situations," he says.
Your child will not only learn to entertain themselves alone, but learns to control better in other areas.
I do not think you really want to praise the boredom.
But we should not be too critical of him.
Our goal should be, rather, to feel comfortable sections of constant rumor and technology activities.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our view, we need more bored, but boredom is too distressing and disturbing desire to relate it to something worthwhile," he says.
He points out that what people really looking for is a way to unwind and enjoy a full timeout.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colorado : no instruction book for the new law on marijuana use
Anthony Orozco, 19 year old student at a community college and southeastern Colorado football player, faces criminal prosecution for something that will soon be legal in statewide: stones possession of marijuana and a pipe used to smoke it.
Orozco says September 1, he and some friends led by Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when police stopped them.
Police found marijuana in the car and some time later Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and related items (misdemeanors each carry a fine of U.S.$ 100) in which he was informed of the trial date.
"We try as a criminal," Orozco dice.
And you are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote that took place in Colorado to legalize possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response causes hundreds of minor drug possession less dependent on the law of the location.
Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana possession are canceling both here and in the state of Washington, which passed a similar measure.
Police departments have failed to file charges against those over 21 years for possessing a small scale, to be adopted once the law legally entered into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors Colorado 's most conservative districts have committed to go ahead with the open cases for possession of marijuana and are still citing people.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent marijuana shops open, recently authorized in their communities.
"All this is changing so fast I do not know what's next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Who is responsible for the regulations in the state of Washington are also mulling over the matter.
And still looking for advice on establishing a licensing system for production, manufacture, distribution and sale, all before the deadline arrives, the December 1, 2013.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in the regulation of the use of marijuana, first therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Alcohol Control Commission of the State of Washington.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions on what might work.
"No precedent exists verdadero that serves as a model," he says.
Washington law, called I- 502, entered into force on December 6, leaving also a year during which they will swim between two waters, as the licensing system in that state not yet exist, but possession will legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues to be resolved during this period, such as how to maintain a balance between the requirement of the state to offer "adequate access" to marijuana and its prohibition authorized to conduct business within cannabis less than 300 meters of schools, parks, play areas and children's centers.
"Nowhere is it more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for legal cannabis, a recently established research group.
On November 21, Oates, the Aurora police chief, sent an email to its police officers in which they reported that the city attorney would no longer prosecute minor misdemeanor for possession of marijuana for the elderly 21 and that the police would press charges against these crimes "with immediate effect".
Oates police chief said they would be responsible for enforcing city regulations governing the cultivation of marijuana for medical purposes and would continue chasing smugglers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the District Attorney Ken Buck, represents a more strict.
After the vote, said his office would pursue the cases of possession of marijuana, primarily to pressure consumers who decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, though many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute against those faults that at the time they occurred were crime," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative on legalizing marijuana.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, and does not mention adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the cases pending for possession.
"I do not think you are wasting your time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, was never considered to take marijuana for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy.
Contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among staff about the great experiment environmentalist in this state.
"This is a cultural barrier district attorneys," said Sean McAllister, an attorney representing Denver defendants for possession of marijuana and it's local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Act.
"They've spent so much time taking people to court, in fact, still can not accept that it is legal," he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way that if Alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become test cases nationwide regarding the legalization of drugs.
While lawyers and state officials have a new frontier of legal sales, also looking forward to receive indications of the federal government, which still provides for consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of marijuana legalization are hopeful that the Department of Justice subsides.
Although there have been some outstanding patient arrests and sellers of marijuana for medical purposes, the federal government has allowed most businesses there are selling marijuana for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"Although it is likely that drug agents do not pull down doors to seize drug bag small, probably will be reluctant to allow the operation of state-regulated shops for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted in the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, a former aide of drug policy the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait for federal act.
Even before election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new store marijuana, even though it takes about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve next week.
"We will not put ourselves in a situation where you authorize someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are looking for what the community voted against voting for what the state voted. "
Many questions arise in this regard.
Petronella Wyatt : "I was harassed to kick me out of Oxford to be a Tory"
No attacks the university for their views alone now
Not remember any time in my life in which there have been dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in which I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, Greek symposium contemporary era that encouraged the two pillars of civilization free thought and tolerance.
However, after two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late 80s to pursue a degree in History, and had packed, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and began to mourn.
My friends were baffled.
The Evening Standard newspaper said that I had left because they tolerate some college buddies keep sex in the next room.
It writer A. N. Wilson announces joking that I had gone because I obligaban drinking cups desconchadas.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I fled because he had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my fancy name, or the fact that it came from a private school.
I harassed for one reason, that the alleged birthplace of the illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric : my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative Party.
You might ask what is it now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students are suffering similar persecution.
Institutionalized and growing hatred toward students of the Conservative Party in Oxford is such that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights that homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (undergraduate grouping) of Corpus Christi College say they are "seriously sections often personally attacked and treated as persona non grata" for his political views.
They want to create a place on the equal opportunities committee of your college to make sure to express their opinions freely.
Their situation was not helped by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland : Young, Bright and on the Right" (Paradise : young, bright and right) on the politics of the students and presented to the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
Showed graduate student Joe Cooke, president of the Conservative Party Association of the University of Oxford (OUCA) in a Rolls- Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with silver handle.
In other universities, students Conservatives say they are treated as "scapegoats" by the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20 years and vice president of the Conservative Party, University of Nottingham, told a Sunday newspaper that " there is a growing trend in universities left.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing. "
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old and a student of history at Corpus Christi who moved the motion for better protection, says that this atmosphere is "uncomfortable" while Cherill Stephanie, 19, is president-elect of the OUCA, says the attitude members of the JCR towards people who are center-right has worsened.
"This is a threat to the environment of intellectual debate and for the welfare of the members," he says.
During my first week in Oxford I was lonelier than one.
I entered college in September 1986, was a 18 year old terribly shy.
The hatred towards the Conservative Party was at its peak.
Last year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, former student, a title "honorary" after cuts in higher education funding.
The atmosphere would have made you shudder with horror to any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week to welcome new university when new students are known and known to professors, I received a sample of bitterness than I expected.
Professors discovered that not only turned a blind eye to the mockery that was made of conservative academics, but participating in it willingly.
The policy of the miners' strike, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa came to the wood of the seminar rooms.
At first I attended had to be translated into English eighteenth -century French texts and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
No ni a.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like cake batter, knew how bad expel bile.
"Is that the Thatcherite refuse to learn French or is that simply are stupid," he asked.
The others laughed university.
My eyes burned from trying to hold back tears.
"I suggest you go to French classes in their free time, as long as not too busy meeting people," he growled Pitt.
Rules to my room like a lost soul.
That night I sat alone at dinner time in college, then I felt a gentle pat on the back.
He was a student of English sophomore named James who introduced herself as a member of the OUCA.
"Be who you are," I said gently.
" I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They go with anyone suspected of being Tory.
For me it is very complicated, but know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be even worse for you.
Many newcomers Tories appear to be Labour. "
Later, at a local pub, I tried to cowardly hide.
I insisted that he did not agree with everything he said Mrs. Thatcher.
That trick was useless.
A first year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said : " You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
Are contaminated. "
Other students adopted this ditty.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How the Tories have sex?" Asked one.
"They are beating each other, right?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before liberal law 60.
Could one day live a normal life in Oxford?
Will I be forced to stay with people who think like me only after dark?
Should I make myself Labour and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that I hoped were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory was Professor Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History aimed at my college.
I hated him for being not only the Conservative Party, but Thatcher adviser on foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches.
Just lay Alli.
He hated the place that he considered insignificant provincial and adherence to the Marxist view of history - deterministic.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"Here in the vas to be happy," me dijo.
I started to commute daily from Oxford to my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and friends metropolitan open minded.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
In creyó me.
When he was studying there in the 40s, were accepted all political views.
"But if it is the best place in the world," he said sadly.
" They would never do that, not here in my beloved dreaming spiers.
Even my friends always had an attitude Communists impeccable. "
His aching eyes began to blur.
" Give him another chance.
I'm sure they have only joking.
It would break my heart if you left. "
Exhausted of many trips to London, my emotional strength was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to the pressure and had renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of history had hinted, speaking entirely seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red with shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" and called them "old stupid".
The truce did not last long.
It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my college career at Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I was huddled in fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers desisted.
When they left I packed and caught the first train to London.
I never went back.
You may call me weak crybaby.
But no person of 18 years should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, not only trained 14 Conservative Party prime ministers but, today, behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to the reputation"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino : Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen - Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer clients
Somerset House, former home of Elizabeth I of England is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition of Valentino Garavani.
The designer has been recognized during the opening of "Valentino : Master of Couture" cataclysmic retrospective brings together more than 130 couture dresses created by the "maison" for the past 50 years.
"I love this building," he says in his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but it could not have been written without their distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the thin and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, open until March 3, private letters and pictures abound with the signing of the cream of the aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing by Princess Marie -Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of their social ascent : from humble designer Voghera city in northern Italy, to idol "jet -set" international.
Being in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
"At least they do not put out their cigarettes butts on your magnificent carpet as some beautiful pop music celebrities," says the Baroness Fiona Thyssen - Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a great host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad," says the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, forgotten beauties intimate as Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, is a star.
Valeria Mazza, a luciendo Valentino
The model Valeria Mazza Argentina does not forget the charisma of the designer.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, went to dinner at his apartment.
There were twenty people, among whom were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decor, the food, the music, everything looked and felt her spirit.
"Every one of the guests made us feel important and loved," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the week of Haute Couture Paris in 1995.
"It never happens because sus fashion designs are works of art" ends.
Parade of rank
Garavani 's life is not a story of obsessions, but well matched loves.
He loves people with good education and better qualifications, and they will love it.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous catwalk sixty feet long proposed a role reversal : the visitor takes the place of the models and be paraded down the catwalk to contemplate a "hearing" dream that masterpieces by Valentino looks like Jackie Kennedy chose dress for her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costumes used Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or wool and leather coat that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In that audience of mannequins shine names like Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette -Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it well.
Was trousers, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket of the autumn- winter 1971-1972.
"It was a gift I did it," says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I prefer him over others for their femininity, for his great love for women, because it enhances our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I love the colors you use, have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The Princess and fashion prescriptive Patricia della Giovampaola d' Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time I wore a Valentino.
As a teenager and lived in Italy, dreamed of reaching age and have the opportunity to be able to use one of its evening wear...
Finally it was time to late 90s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with ruffled skirt, "corsage" draped strapless neckline.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d' Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless," says this Italian aristocrat living between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
D' Arenberg The princess saves your designer party dresses with "the utmost care... because a dress not just a dress, it is also the set of memories that entails."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie -Chantal Miller at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the designer calls his seamstresses) to develop this ivory silk gown encrusted with pearls, twelve different types of lace and a tail four feet.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the press, a milestone that dress high fashion of the late twentieth century, "the return of the high-society clients."
Obsessed for years with the "savoir -être" of the elite, now Valentino is the best example.
Knight Grand Cross (the distinción de más alto en -ranking Italian), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L' Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, condecorado with the Legion of Honor, Garavani acumula tantos honores cualquiera de como los de sus Esposos clientas.
"I have always been struck by his refinement, his calm, neat appearance and perfect," says D' Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He was at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was spotless, time stands still for him."
If it says a princess...
The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, porters Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health 70 kilos of sulfur loading by steep stone paths
There are people for whom work is hell and one that literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make their living pulling the volcano Kawah Ijen sulfur, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this you have to go down every day until the bottom of the crater, where the sulfur dioxide gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth solidifies on contact with air.
After starting sulfur boulders, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, the leads on two bamboo baskets burden on their shoulders through steep rocky paths.
They are just 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2386 meters altitude, but the exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to ascend to a crawl, balancing gingerly and measuring his steps do not slip and fall the precipice.
They know that any misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who plunged years ago by the cliffs of Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents per every kilo of sulfur extracted
Once up, make their way through the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys, laboriously carrying the heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has located a little below, at 1,850 meters high.
PT is Ngrimbi Candi, a company that since 1960 the volcano explodes and never better, their workers, who pay Rp 662 (five cents) for every kilo of sulfur.
Then sell it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetic, whitening dynamite and even sugar.
"As usual it is loaded 70 kilos, took some 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who often make three freight daily.
It takes three hours each and just grind, but allow you to collect 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a pittance for so inhuman effort is triple than you would in the field.
"The wages of the miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros)," says the carrier, who previously worked as a bricklayer in the resort island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the pit was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a compelling reason, in Indonesia, is as strong as sulfur : "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and have brought Java to convert to Islam".
Anto has asthma, difficulty breathing, constantly coughing and eye irritation by toxic gas
At 27 years, Anto has three risking his skin in the Kawah Ijen, sulfur which has already begun to take its toll despite covering her face with a mask and goggles.
Have asthma, breathing is difficult, constantly coughing and eye irritation by toxic gases given off the volcano.
It's the price you pay to get your dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French" promises a more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this young man could be sympathetic and intelligent tour guide, waiter or hotel clerk, but instead does the work of a mule.
Sharing a log cabin unclean with other carriers, gets up every day at two in the morning because sulfur does not stop well at night, when its characteristic yellow color is blue and glows in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, lighting their Anto the crater floor with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he bought with his money.
Some 400 porters carry baskets on their shoulders sulfur from the crater
Despite their huge profits, the mining company has no sulfur removal machining to save costs or provide any equipment to carriers, who work on their own and therefore weight.
In fact, do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guardians of this nature come to the tourists who flock to photographing the volcano and their human mules.
"This work is for the animals and not people," protest Madrusin, a burly porter of 42 years at the Kawah Ijen three decades, since leaving school.
Able to lift up to 110 kilos, ensures that endure working "all you can" because he needs the money to educate her three children, aged 18 and 10 years.
I retire, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life
Although sulfur burning throat and stings the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and the miners trapped in the thick plumes coming out of the volcano, are so hard that no one complains of serious illness... beyond, of course, of his regular breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and sore shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, and can only load Unainik 50 kilos at 53 years.
Every day, he and his fellow tear 15 tons of sulfur volcano that three trucks to move Tamansari store, 18 miles away by a goat path in the undergrowth.
"I did not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life," proclaims Unainik opening the mouth, where several teeth missing.
Of his five children, the oldest, 30, also works loading sulfur.
Time passes, but perpetuates poverty from one generation to one of the toughest jobs in the world: the human mules making of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the race, stress and cost of property and education by not having children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow".
I am a patriotic husband, you are my wife patriotic,do our civic duty and believe life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of a notice of mints, but despite this - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bao (bun) in the oven" to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is hopeful that with the announcement achieve draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music for people to comply with "national duty".
This is purely internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the world's worst replicate ourselves, so we felt that this was an issue we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, like throwing perfume with pheromones or organize speed dating evenings (speed-dating).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why not make it as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
He who does not take it so lightly is the Singapore government.
Spend$ 1,300 per year on policies to encourage people to have more children.
A package of government grants for married couples and parents up to$ 15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city state and high-tech rich in Southeast Asia, also known by the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to their national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 - called replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why Singaporeans do not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division, said to be due to a "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"That has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, rather than marry and raise a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase of singleness, and delay marriage and births, which results in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an EU immigration policy point to dramatically increase immigration to cope with the decline in population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where barely disguised xenophobia abounds with many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not be integrated.
Increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the ruling party of Singapore experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher fees and levies for foreign workers.
unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to build as many houses are not small.
For example, it has started to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has come to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface of 46 square meters and have been very successful sales.
However, there is concern that they may promote a lifestyle of celibacy and discourage developers who want to build houses large family.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of the real estate company THE Developers, says his "shoe boxes" sold much faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that the units are exhausted days, even weeks, faster than the larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidance to developers, who put obstacles before them if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, when talking to Singaporeans working in the downtown financial district seems that they will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are putting off," says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But for me it is important to have my own money and time," says another young man of about 20 years.
Men and women report their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So much the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, are Singaporeans who have the final word.
Lo privado off line es privado online
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy is the quality of private or "the sphere of private life are entitled to be protected from any interference."
What is private to a person under 16 years?
How to apply this definition in their daily lives and social networks?
Do you understand the dangers they are exposed by Internet ventilate situations that probably would not share offline?
elPeriódico interviewed five boys aged between ten and 15 years, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, associated the term to "something mine," on a personal level, and "in the user name and password", when applied to social networks.
"My deepest secrets not a post would go up," says Jorge, aged ten, when trying to explain the meaning of private sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it accounts for two years.
"They are very secret secrets, my mother can know, but worldwide," he says.
In FB upload pretty pictures or games.
I also entertain with my acquaintances.
"There would share a photo that is not mine, or someone who is being ridiculous," he says.
The child recognizes that bad post obscene pictures of naked people, crimes or write reviews humiliating or violent.
Jorge says meet the 35 friends you have on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most are related.
The mother is included, holds the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express and write interesting tweets.
"I do not know if I answer, I only go up," he adds.
"Social networking is fun, I can talk with distant relatives or friends quickly," he says.
No doubt he said never accept an application from an unknown person.
Neither would do if someone you recommend to a stranger.
The case of Joseph, aged 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask in the latter admits not knowing 20 people added in your list of friends.
"I'm not afraid, because we have something in common, eg music," he says.
According to the boy, none has been suggested and has asked the home address or telephone number.
"If you pressure me or I simply demand it out of my mind," he admits.
Joseph became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy did not are outside the experience of what is now known as cyberbullying.
To an acquaintance of my friend were extorting him on a social network.
Threatened him and demanded money.
"I never knew who he was," he says.
The victim, according to Jose, did not close the account.
"Just put privacy."
Then explain a series of steps to set up the account safely.
Unlike George, this guy would climb known photos of uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes I would, if I get sick or you 've been wanting.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying" he says.
key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents should be understood that the purpose of social media is to inform.
"Internet emerged as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites changed the rules of the game" he says.
Porras says scholar Marc Prensky, Masters in Education from Yale University and author of the book Digital Natives and Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are they, the children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.
He says that the issue is complex, "because we are asking you have defined criteria about what is appropriate or not to disclose, publish or say in an age that maturity is not enough for that."
"Also to be selective when it matters most is to be popular, have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children what is privacy and adolescents is through questions that make them think.
"Tell him not to no good," he adds.
Then Porras lists some options : There are things you do not would you tell a stranger, why do it online?
Or, would you like to publish a photo of you as a friend you published?
You know what others post about you?
When you tag photos of parties,? Asked permission to others to label them?
And one more, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to show them that they must act on line as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"One out of Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, you should still be on social networks," he says.
surveillance
Stuart Guard, university professor, elementary school teacher and educational consultant, says it is essential that parents read the policy thoroughly social networks.
By understanding each of the paragraphs they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the implications of opening an account online.
"For example, age and what is permitted to share or publish" he says.
According to Guard, is key to the children remember the lesson of "do not talk to strangers".
Unasur Summit ends without making public the Lima Declaration

The little information that circulated among reporters was given by the press spokespersons some Unasur governments attending the meeting, but not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the presidents list of attendees, causing discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for more data.
Subsequently, the President of Peru sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" from the summit, but it is the pronouncement of Humala, not the official document that ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III Summit of South American -Arab Countries (ASPA), and this time, despite being requested repeatedly by the press, not spread the Lima Declaration also called previously had announced.
In the official website of ASPA can confirm that the document was published on Tuesday.
In both international events, Peruvian authorities have endeavored to transmission systems for all journalists insured but limited the maximum fetch.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling of the Court in The Hague to adjudicate a dispute between the two countries border.

"Chile has been, is and will remain a country that respects international law to the peaceful resolution of disputes, of treaties and international courts," said Piñera, and greeted with a handshake Humala, along the flags of the two countries.
Confirmation of both presidents to be submitted to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Pact of Bogotá for which he had agreed to be the international court rulings that after a decision on maritime boundary with Nicaragua that considered seriously flawed.
The summit was held with the absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.

With Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) should have an array triumphalistic but should serve to expand nustra productive matrix and envision a better future for our peoples," Humala said.
"We decided to favor a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said Peruvian President in a message read.
Among these projects, five are mentioned Peru, and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection to Ecuador, but gave no further details.
Also, the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in the country serve to his reinstatement in the Union of South American Nations," which is currently excluded.
The need remains Latin America as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good neighborly relations, was another issue highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos said before you start participating in the regional meet expected meet his pair of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat respectfully the maritime dispute after failure of the ICJ, questioned by Bogota.

"With President Ortega hope to tell you handle this in the most civilized and respectful as possible," said Santos.
Santos Ortega would meet Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the inauguration of the new president of the country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also as part of the summit, the bloc's defense ministers met previously to approve the Plan of Action of 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay make up UNASUR, although the latter is suspended.
Peru has the rotating presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America should learn from Europe to integrate citizenship" : Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that "South America, in this case, yes, you must learn from Europe."
Correa, who attended the Presidential Summit VI Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Lima, told TV Peru state that Europeans "were killed in the Second World War" and other conflicts, "but now are practically a homeland".
Defended, in that sense, the project of establishing the South American citizenship that encourage member countries of UNASUR.
"You have to get the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country, as is the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors we want to return to the past," he said.
Ecuadorian President was also in favor of the restructuring of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and take into account those who have signed the Pact of San José on the rights humans.
The chair giving pledge never to anything and instead, we all signed the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Human Rights Commission is in Washington on U.S. funding," he said in reference to the given political asylum by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he's not regretted that decision because this has not betrayed its principles, but has respected its "deep democratic values and human rights."
He added that, at the time, "had reasonable suspicion that Assange be extradited to a third country and respect their process."
Also criticized by the Swedish justice required to undergo interrogation into their territory for an alleged sexual offense when "Swedish legislation itself can be done via video conferencing could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa said that there is a risk of deterioration in physical and mental health of Assange.
"I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me I had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the president of Ecuador.
What there is the danger of deterioration in his physical and mental health by being locked in a small space without doing outdoor exercises.
"That complicates the health of any person," he added.
Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the provision of a safe-conduct that lets you travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there has been talks with London in search of a solution to the closure of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing talks.
"The solution of this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities because Assange 's lawyer, Baltazar Garzon, is doing a series of procedures in different European institutions," he said.
And said "if Britain gives the pass this morning is over."
And if Sweden, as well as legislation allows and as it has done in other cases, questioned Mr. Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or via Skype tomorrow asks just this problem.
Correa took the opportunity to reassert itself as a defender of press freedom and added that it will not tolerate is "mediocrity, dishonesty and lies that undermine freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil and wicked politicians but the bad journalists by profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In that aspect they are no longer welcomed these journalists "nor the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries which dominate Ecuador", and said that to be reelected "will deepen the revolution to continue the path and the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the ban on Paraguay in the Unasur at least until their next election, arguing that the agency "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and legality coated coup" because actually "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Ecuadorian President also considered "perfectly well" the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua maritime boundary between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment not abide the judgment.
It is a problem between a South American country and one Central.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will to walk together.
You have to process them wide to overcome them and move on.
Also relied on a good conclusion of litigation maritime boundaries in the same court held Peru and Chile and said "is correct for Latin America seek international organizations if the two countries agree to accept failure hard it is."
Referring to the possibility that as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term said he sees that possibility "with optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard."
Correa said that if he loses the elections of February 2013 will retire from public life.
Personally never interested me power, but in situations as unjust as the socio-economic poverty Ecuador that can only be corrected by the political power.
"My political movement thought it was me who ensured that probable victory, because we have to accept that RESPONSIBILITY" he said.
To win would be my last term in office and then went out of public life.
If we lose the same.
"It is a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new treatment health of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro and tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was planned routine, which was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse into the state of health of President Chavez," he said.
The head of Ecuador participated today in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) which led to calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are due to late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the test result : positive AIDS.
"It was like I dropped a bomb," refers to recall the time of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to do "more softly" without apparent success.
The boy hid his family.
Decided to take one of their illness and began to learn about her, with such efforts already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients HIV Unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 90s, when there were many questions, few treatment options and stigma.
Then, to the director of an IMSS clinic avoided goodbye to him "because he had a cut".
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now you can survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, unaware of their disease, yet many people go when the virus has already caused havoc, "exhausted" your immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the onset of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement means at this point that the survival of a patient initiates timely treatment and survival of the general population, is exactly like,"the head of the HIV Unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring to this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific journal.
Infectious disease expert in HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that have patients to start the diagnosis with better expectation for non- drug users : up to 30 years with a CD4 count of 200 and 50, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, this means that the person receiving the HIV diagnosis at 25 years of age, under these terms "while you keep in control can live without problems until 75 years," said the interviewee.
To measure this progress, remember that life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
Although mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the appearance AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
Jalisco Only 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths go until May of this year, however it is ensured that no universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why is there still deaths?
- I think that the problem is not access to treatment.
So I visualize it, so it has happened in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have had shortages of medicine the problem is that patients get very advanced because they know their HIV status, that is, in the later stages of the disease.
Data gave a resounding: "Nine out of ten patients come when they have an opportunistic infection that has to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality, is to make earlier diagnosis and, therefore, will have to provide evidence massively detection, to all who require it."
In its proposal coincide specialists and State Council officials in Jalisco AIDS Prevention (COESIDA), also the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who came to be tested to a particular laboratory, motivated only because he had a friend and, despite at a young age, I was on stage and even suffered AIDS Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they are going to die and not want to know.
"If I'm going to die, I better bust three times a week," say not in my case.
The change was for the better, I eat well, I exercise, I take my drugs.
To date, his parents just know they had cancer.
I live a normal life as anyone.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but responsible, I take care of myself and the other person" listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share her intimacy with MILLENNIUM JALISCO to motivate people with his testimony today in the part of World AIDS Day, they fear.
They get tested, if they had risk, the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, it is better and if you have the diagnosis, you learn that they can live like any person, being responsible.
That, your message, slogan summarizes the AIDS battle in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Great are the gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, Guadalajara journalist who has taken up the cause around HIV.
And the greatest is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task "actually has increased the distribution of condoms, before giving us one or two, now give us a hundred packages, and that is fine but it turns out that some people today still do not have access a condom,"he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"What do you want them?" is common question sarcastically and value judgments of social workers, school counselors, employees of pharmacies and health personnel, which does not want to expose teens said the communicator.
Proposed to refocus this inefficient allocation, that condoms are not only behind the counters and those hundred dispatchers are in public restrooms places frequented by young people.
Not encourage promiscuity.
Nor is it to pay the beers and the motel, as Governor Emilio Gonzalez said, when asked if there would be distribution of condoms in his Administration.
"It is not sexuality, it's best to bring condoms to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 1,317 AIDS and HIV).
The state is 4th in the nation in new cases and cumulative AIDS and HIV 13 °.
92% of infections corresponds to sexually, 6% to the bloodstream and 2% for perinatally.
An estimated 50 thousand people may be living with HIV as a case registered about 4-5 people who do not know.
Ratified by an appeals court of the United States a judgment which ignores the debt restructuring of Grupo Vitro via a bankruptcy achieved in Mexico, the stage sets an ominous precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country with solvency problems.
It seems, then, that the proceedings in support of survival of firms allow Mexican law are not valid in the country of the bars and stars, against the international conventions.
In practical terms, the endorsement of the ruling issued last June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, left helpless Mexican firms face the possibility of seizure of their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the decision opens the door to the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming three inconsistencies.
Input, while the trial judge noted that creditors must abide by the Bankruptcy of the United States, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main action is handled in bankruptcy Mexico.
The first point would ignore international procedural cooperation in insolvency transnational companies profiled.
In fact, to this end created the United Nations Model Law on Uniform International Commercial Law, standing as an arbitrator by the American Law Institute.
Second, the judgment states that without the vote intercompany recognized the critical mass of bankruptcy debts owed to its parent subsidiaries of Vitro, had not achieved the required majority to approve the restructuring.
However, the ability to recognize Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts intercompany endorsed the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
The truth also is that subtracting the votes of subsidiaries, anyway Vitro 's creditors who fought it in the courts of the United States, ie the "vulture" funds as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, have not achieved majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37.
The figure omits the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, it blames Vitro of the difficult situation faced sideways from 2008 to the severe economic crisis faced by the United States, hitting the tail to the country.
For now, the family firm Sada Gonzalez will lodge an appeal before the appellate court itself that the vote comes to the floor of it, ie the five judges, as voted only three.
Not successful this resource will be claimed will make sure that the process requires a review by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The worst part is that the court sidestepped a document sent by the government of Mexico under the form of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which is the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Bankruptcy Law commercial, noting that it is vented with adherence to the agreements signed by the two countries to tie it with Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Law of the United States.
Moreover, it is noted that the country bowed to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, ie fixed rules for cross-border insolvency cases, ensuring equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambola two bands: they strike Vitro and hit the country.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes : "Basketball has been my life"
Globetrotters basketball Hector "Hetin" Reyes was over 60 years tabloncillo linked to sport and, thanks to him, traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico has a mental collection of local basketball history as broad as is Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And is that before stroke confine him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for over 60 years as a player was smaller categories, National Superior Basketball player, agent and leader in the BSN with Bayamón Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I wore many hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was chairman of BSN, general manager and president of the National Team during the 90 federative" recalled Reyes during a visit of First Time to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Elizabeth, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate to make that assertion.
The walls of his home, almost all decorated with pictures and memorabilias denoting his long career, testify to this.
Bayamón in the heart
In all, more emotion treasured are those that recall its way through the Cowboys since the mid- 50s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years serving as coapoderado or possession of the franchise.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed it because I had the opportunity to be part of the Cowboys eight championships since 1967, either as agent, coapoderado or leader.
There were many years of satisfaction, including five consecutive championships from 1971-1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the debut year of Jerome Mincy in BSN.
Thereafter he took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, "said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), I said : "I have a player you tight, 6 ' 7" tall.
You want it? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that have had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse sniper who was nativizado and was one of our best shooters.
I remember him saying that if he had given Mincy championship Bayamon, Gausse help bring another.
The Cowboys championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but because of the distance, because for 1988 and federal honcho figured.
At that time preferred to enjoy their accomplishments and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we won for the first time to the United States in the 1989 Olympic Qualifying in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got fourth place and bronze should have been but for that Canadian referee made us repeat the final play for the second time, said Reyes.
Is that World Cup 1990 group is the best national team you've seen?
It is among the best, like the one that beat the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave him a beating the U.S. team, which was quite similar to that we won bronze at the World Cup.
That team not only repeated to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had to (Javier) "Toñito" Columbus and James Carter Young, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who was unable to be in the 90 due to a knee injury.
A team that maybe was not the best in terms of personnel, but gave a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Olympic Qualifying in Neuquen, Argentina.
With role players as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a juvenile Rolando Hourruitiner to replace the suspended players for the mess of the Pan de Mar del Plata, won gold against all odds.
What has been the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, this has been Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at international tournaments are awesome.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as did Piculín.
Not to mention his experience in different leagues he played.
Who has been the best Puerto Rican coach?
That is very difficult.
We had a very good litter including Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From young, I love the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995 and the early 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What was I to do?
There were things I had wanted to implement, such as regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, Ponce boys only play in your area and only faced teams from other parts of the Island in the national playoffs.
Right now children ride and play too unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of Compulsory certifications and course leaders, table officials and referees.
Eso me complace.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy me my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Elizabeth, who has always been with me.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "JR"., In the television series "Dallas" in the embodying an unscrupulous businessman, malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon JR predator Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.

"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again representing the iconic role he liked" the family said.
Larry 's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the holiday of Thanksgiving Day.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said her publicist, Jeffrey Lane.
We had joy to all who knew him.
It was creative, generous, fun, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"It was an original and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
A Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1992 and acknowledged that he had drank heavily for years.
In 1995 he found a malignant tumor and underwent liver transplantation.
Years before "Dallas," Hagman became famous on TV as a decent guy in light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", aired on NBC from 1965-1970.
It played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he meets an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him in his house.
He starred in two comedies too little air time were "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included roles well received by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable JR that led to its maximum Hagman stardom.
The drama series on CBS about the Ewing clan and other characters in his orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The tagline "Who shot JR?", Designed to generate hype around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman 's character is nearly killed, generated international speculation and risky million in bookmakers.
It also helped give the series a record audience at the time.
When the answer was revealed in an episode of November 1980, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and turned the "Dallas" in the second most watched entertainment program in history, behind the finale of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
She was the sister of JR, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J. R. impregnated her and then threatened to cross it off unless prostitute out of town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Ewing Hagman portrayed as a corrupt insatiable with a charismatic smile : an entrepreneur and a cheating husband cheater who tried his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), was interned.
"I know what I want on JR 's tombstone." Said Hagman in 1988.
Should read : "Here lies the honest citizen JR Ewing."
This is the only negotiating he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled on Friday Hagman as someone "huge, in and out of the screen".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable, to millions of fans worldwide, and in the hearts of each of us who were fortunate to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for TNT.
He had already finished recording five chapters for the second season and a sixth was in process, the network reported.
Immediately there was a statement from Warner or TNT on how to handle the loss Hagman series.

Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to attorney Ben Hagman.
Tried his luck in the New York theater scene at the beginning of the 1950s, then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.

It was also an activist against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Begin course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore topics like nuclear war apocalyptic, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the Stuart Charmé religion teacher decided to teach a course on the end of the world, I knew I had a compelling hook : The end of the "long count down" of the Mayan calendar on December 21, which have clinging many people as evidence that the end of the world comes.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: The cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy a fiscal cliff some have called "deudarmagedón" and a growing conflict involving Israel, where Christians theorists to believe time will start the Apocalypse.
"I did not realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester has been," he said this week Charmé students at Rutgers University -Camden (New Jersey).
If you look at what has been happening in the world today like we're at 30 days and counting, this has been a really good time.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mindset.
And he is not only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, theoretically the last of the story.
In Temple, associate professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the end of the world".
Each week, students explore topics like nuclear war apocalyptic, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We looked at why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way they offer some scenarios that guide human behavior.
If nuclear material falling into terrorist hands, for example, could set off a war.
This month students apocalyptic themed films analyzed and explored how they compare with real life examples.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, believable and impossible," said Vacker.
The main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and Amara Solari colleague, an associate professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course titled just "The End of the World".
"We do not add '2012 'to always have the option to run the course again, if the world does not end," said Restall.
Despite the "impending doom", students should study, generate projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the very night that the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"It is saturated in two hours," said Restall on its course for students with high GPA, which was filled with 35 students.
We receive emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if it was no place.
Students, meanwhile, ensures that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a student at the race in Religion and Sociology 23 years of Haddonfield, New Jersey at Rutgers -Camden.

We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of reckoning, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that 21 December is the beginning of a period of seven years after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking lightly the date.
Several said they plan to go to parties "doomsday".
