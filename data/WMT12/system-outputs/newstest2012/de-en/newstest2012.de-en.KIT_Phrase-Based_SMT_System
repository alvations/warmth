No liberating novella for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament refused the request, in the context of a revision of the Penal Code to eliminate those paragraphs, the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was sentenced on the basis.
The new rules, which could have been the way for the release of the detained Expremierministerin can pave the MEPs rejected at the second reading of the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was sentenced in October because of the conclusion of a supposedly negative treaty with Russia on the purchase of natural gas to seven years in prison.
The verdict is not yet to be negotiated, in December, the appeal of those convicted in court.
Timoshenko even described the verdict as a political revenge by the regime, and also in the West, the process of the suspicion of bias of the court.
The request to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of the Expremierministerin has been condemned from the penal code, was supported by 147 members.
226 votes would have been required to its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation or Libyan rebellion already familiar with their losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi lies buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him, the war is over.
Now it is just to define the winner.
As usual, this region, to win in the elections, Islamists, the only question is what the moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council is known for the customary law Scharīʿa, we now God has some idea.
Libya would land without crime, because they hurt each for theft, one in short hand.
Women should also quickly forget the idea of emancipation, any renegade faith are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator will be united society mutually abandoned to feuding tribes from the Koran.
In short, in Libya, an order that the country would be hard to imagine, especially hardly desirable.
Only our lifestyle is not the only seen objectively and probably not the best and would hardly fit - the Libyans.
So it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters help the infidel dogs.
Their apology may only serve to the fact that the NATO air attacks were not by any general from America, but from Allah himself, whose omnipotence hailed after every successful hit.
The victors in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We were only brought in a gun battle, served the interests of Islam and our politicians, ousting in the person of the dictator's political allies, without any benefit.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we saw from a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the Hiesigen concern - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
The oil companies, but also without occupation of black gold price derision?
Hardly, and can boast the West once rightly his selflessness in the protection of human rights.
If they do not spoil the Scharīʿa representatives.

The menu of a fat addict child: it is not eating and eating for dinner sausage
More than a third of the children from 9 to 13, have problems with obesity, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children are overweight.
Recent opinion polls - obese children often come from families affected by unhealthy lifestyles.
It shows once again how important for the healthy development of a human environment, where he breeds and the examples are surrounded.
On the tables of obese children were sausage half more on the table than in families in which normal weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children were on the eve of the educational campaign under the slogan "obesity is not a coincidence," chips for dinner.
In families with Dickerchen also includes sports not the favourite jobs, but the majority of today's students - only 15 percent said that their parents are least once a week to find time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was held last year at the end of the school year, were interviewed nearly 900 children from primary schools in the Czech Republic.
It was the second year of operation, "obesity is not a coincidence," which will be supported by the general health insurance company and the company Unilever.
So far, participated in the project, more than 12 thousand pupils from 4th and 8th classes.
Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family are key factors, which are responsible for the alarming increase in the number of children who are overweight or obesity.
"Only half the children, for example, five times a day, in the mode of breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-Vesper to eat supper - one of the main conditions for a healthy diet," is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relatively minor matters, as well as the regular breakfast time, for example, the family are important for the healthy development of a child.
Eating in the Czech Republic, but only 23 percent of the families of the students.
And, in most families eating alone.
The worst was the observation, not gefrühstückt in every tenth family.
Breakfast is the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The poll brought test, among other things, that the families of overweight children consumed more unhealthy chips.
And almost everyone - regardless of jeopardising weight - drink every day, sweet fizzy drinks (70%) 
More than 40 percent of the surveyed children's sports, but only less than half of their parents do - only 15 percent.
Imagine your own menu together
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), offered opportunities for appetites and believe their own menu.
" What prefer Czech children between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition, is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favourite foods were many flour foods, meat dishes and, of course, Süßspeisen.
"What is alarming is the great popularity of sweet fizzy drinks" in the final report on the survey.
At lunch, the main court, pasta just before poultry.
Pulses liked children virtually nonexistent and the popularity of fish and vegetables courts as lunch was very low.
Hinkehr health
At the same time, the survey showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits, if they get the right information.
"In the control group of the survey participants, filling out the questionnaire after the conclusion of the informative lecture" obesity is not a coincidence, "was, in many cases, a significant shift towards preferences to principles of healthy diet" is mentioned in the results of the project.
Striking this was, for example, in the sweet Limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children have intersected much more often in the questionnaire, poultry or fish as a main course of the day and were ready to eat less dumplings or sweet foods.
Experts say a Stylist - must be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how to learn Stylisten, I had a bit of gemeckert that it was a bit too much for the beginning.
As I suspected, not in the least, which is yet to come.
Lectures by three experts from the industry, the clothing of problematic characters and a seminar on how the "place."
It is worse to come.
The closer we get to the examination, more information and practical tasks ahead of us.
But even if the course every Saturday and Sunday will take place, it is full.
This time we debated attracts with director Alena (the rate is not a single man), as a woman who has no ideal proportionierte figure.
And these are, after all, most of us.
Have a short neck, the other a young best figure without proper curves and others are mollig.
It is a matter for the Stylisten to extend broad shoulders looks to conceal the neck or the necessary hervorzuzaubern curves.
We also got clues to how Frauentyp as Jennifer Lopez - with great, wide hip and pretty thin waists and attracts figure stresses that it is too provocative.
If, for example, the difference between waists and waists is so great that the skirt or trousers really does not fit, you should at least cut a measure.
It will certainly not repent, because well-seated clothing is simply unaffordable.
In such a tailor-made rock you feel much better than in a bar, constantly high and verrutscht in absteht waists, etc.
Boys, formulaic characters, in turn, can afford to wear clothing with wrinkles, Bausch, applications, embroidery or Raffung.
This quantity of information and character types, I am glad that I have a whole week for me to go through the head.
And yet, I am afraid that it is almost impossible to achieve, given the assigned homework.
Each of the rate of domestic participants got a celebrity, for which they devise suitable Outfits - day clothes and evening wardrobe.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of stars and Figurtyp.
I should attract Miranda Kerr ,"" you may be out of the campaign, Victoria's Secret.
Inside, I juble, because it is much better for me personally, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has grown in recent times, the hundred kilos (okay, that is a bit exaggerated, or even the young Selena Gomez.
The clothes we are supposed to consider reprinting from magazines ausschneiden or on the Internet, and then telegraphically.
" In the Mood Board, the result is known, then our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the Stylings.
The Stylist the models not only physically, but also the so-called product page in the magazine (concrete target, for example, trend-handbags, coats, etc.).
This told us the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But only on Sunday.
This means that a Stylist must have a good overview.
With information on the types of characters filled Saturday lecture has been seasoned by three visitors from the industry:
The Pokorný Stylisten Jan, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and a Stylist should be able to exploit it.
And eingeschickter Stylist with a single piece of clothing to work in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
You can, for example, a Trenchcoat as usual on the jeans, a T-shirt or coat, but also on the naked body, paragraph shoes can attract and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up our sleeves or collar and the whole look is quite different.
 "To play," he said.
Most came but I want the following advice: "first you need to know what the rules are perfect."
"Only then can they violate," said Jakub.
At last, it is clear to me why we pauken all these theories, which can be combined with what and why, even if in fashion journals are often very different to see.
A look of fashion.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a Stylist clothing options much more prepared than he ultimately photographed.
We therefore need to be prepared for a Fashion story with ten pages (read ten Outfits) to stylen at least 15.
And also that the clothing on the photograph, in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality.
With all that we must therefore expect the shaping of the Outfits.
That image and sometimes Styl account for half of the success, which also confirmed Jan Pokorný.
Since you need only Madonna, not brilliant singer from the image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic is one of the services of a Stylisten rather reserved.
Well-known personalities, it is often wasted money (the main thing is that I am, how I turned out secondary).
And if anyone stylen from us, then we should expect that he or she is very likely to be a very different (smaller) imposing size when he or she needs in reality.
Then we need then to googlen to determine with certainty that the tabloid press, the celebrity was again or fallen, etc.
Jan and Mario on Sunday to believe that a Stylist only to focus on fashion and clothes, "assemble" needs.
In his work, above all, he must communicate with the people, he stylt and he must be a psychologist.
Assess people without curry and his opinion.
"If any manager, in order to supplement their clothes cupboard to sift through and beautiful pieces, then we can't eliminate the entire wardrobe and say - my God, this is terrible."
"We must find at least a few worthy, which recommends what you can wear," says Mario.
He also showed us exactly what needs to be a so-called "pocket."
So a bag in the zuknöpft waists and in all the necessary Proprietäten in.
No such clear, such as scissors, Abroller to remove hair or safety needles, it also contains such Utensilien a nylon thread (the Stylist helps the photographing of products, such as handbags or hats), specific clips with the clothes will be killed if they are too big (outlets needles or other crunch banned the substance, not broken) and, of course, Nähzeug.
But we must not only listen, but also can try something practical, we learned how to properly unterklebt shoes.
The photography in the Atelier, where the floor you can damage the shoe bottom, let alone the outside.
O screwed us and we screwed...
With the gap should not affect the shoes, so that they are not damaged.
So you really have to proceed.
Mario enjoyed, he praised my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill is not my strength.
All of this was just the fraction of what we hear on the second weekend serial course.
One thing is now clear to me - to devote Styling at professional level, there is no pushover.
V Need for steroids: "the run" - the illegal racing across America
Recession
The original reckless journey through a series of entirely preventable, amateurish mistakes routine to Frühschicht.
It was able to meet the ambitions of a large part of it, but what is the point, though it is obvious that no one had the inclination to do a bit more.
Even before he came to the Ladentische evoking the new part with the subtitle " the run ' high expectations.
He promised to postpone the bejahrte Games series ' need for speed, " a step in a new dimension and he seemed to be not only one of many action Rennspielen to be in the spielbaren demonstration examples.
We were also curious as to how the lateral passages, in which the main protagonist is rising from the car and on foot.
But how it is used in NFS, is much different than we had expected.
Sure, there are potentially quite decent Arkade races, but overall, the game will be reduced by some unnecessary mistakes in this series, more or less for a few years.
So there are no more mistakes, but rather signs of incomprehensible in principle laziness of the games developers.
The adventure begins very well.
First introduced in the history of its main character, Jack has some problems of a personal nature; it seems to be the only solution to take part in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, to the steering wheel, with the task, to be the first in New York.
The basic idea involves a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into 10 stages and more than 50 individual race.
This means that each race will be fought on the other line, and that the various stages in different sufficiently different and interesting milieu.
No time has the impression that the game would be the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are still very nicely, although not the technical level of graphics on the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing earth-shattering news.
But the journey through the desert, obvious autumn landscape or high through deep snow landscape we visually very pleasant.
And atypical elements bring a bit of a change in the individual race.
In the desert, for example, you will be surprised by a desert storm, the strong point of view.
In the mountains, we must be careful, just as painful as that is not being buried by an avalanche.
Incidentally, are pretty well built in the individual race.
Only a few, but they are.
For a while, trying to overtake the mandatory number of opponents (in principle, a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the Stoppuhr), then expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
And interfering nor the police, which wants to blow the whole thing.
A novelty passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It is more certain interactive animation, in which Jack anyone flees and where he must help the players, at the right moment the right button.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there is much less such passages in the game, as you would expect (only three).
This is ultimately a matter for the advantage, because at least has no chance of this element to be boring - it is in the context of the high point of the elements that make the game varied.
The Fahrmodell is progressing in the Fußtapfen the previous parts.
In other words, seen from today's spotlight, it snaps no trees, on the other hand, you could not say it would be a bad thing.
Anyone who seeks realistic simulations must look elsewhere.
But an action-laden cyclist at the European Fahrmodell will continue to do quite well, although we could compete better.
Until then, as far as everything.
Real problems only after a certain time.
The collision model is not OK in contrast to the Fahrmodell
It is a game of this kind is hard to expect that calculated complicated deformations and collisions, but in any impact on any object has a clue how the car is, obviously, not everything is in order.
A typical example: close overhaul or pre-travel in accommodating cars ' touched ' only slightly in others, almost identical situation but the slings and turns wild performance in some places the other car.
Or the Karre to scrap.
Thanks to the Restart system that makes nothing further, it is annoying.
The Restarts are resolved: if you have damage or remote route, then raises the game back to the last point of reference.
Only in each race has only five Restarts.
If they are exhausted, everything is go.
The Restarts are rather as a tool in the event that something does not succeed, but it should rely on no one.
Sometimes, however, does not help the Restart, there is nothing more than to learn the critical section from the head.
It is very embarrassed that the same things often happen at the same places.
Some curves, we must go to very specific way, for example, otherwise it is not easy.
Elsewhere, it is the appropriate place "civilian" cars in the same configuration, regardless of whether the first or fifth, five seconds sooner or later a minute.
This is particularly galling in situations when we see that the opponent before a romped in two forthcoming cars, but even there, the cars are already in such a position that they must avoid or delay.
And it does not matter when it arrives, everything is designed so that this situation is always close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the game, there are a few places where it is always on the same spot will be overtaken by the same opponents again without regard to the timing.
On Verrücktesten is at the end of the game in the long bridge, which is happening in the opposite direction.
The opponent is obviously to overtake.
And if he is already facing a, then that is the point of view, of course, so that they initially car a couple of times in Klump.
Clearly, we want to make the game simply more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that they quickly spoiled the joy of the game.
And that is a pity, because the game is quite entertaining despite easier Fahrmodell and also downloaded action so that almost no longer know where one of the head.
And in principle, regardless of what is to blame - the concept of fifty unique routes, the order of the race in a way that no volume of boredom, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is the change in the course of the race.
We must overlook the stations on the route, because you can change the car, although in most cases, the car is enough, it has.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for straight highways and exotic super-sports car for the technical journeys, for example, on the Serpentinen in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the history of the game is also the tasks mode (challenges) - the race in the individual localities from history.
There is not just medals, but also to gain experience for their own profile, which is jointly for the tasks (challenges) and history.
In order to achieve higher driver level must be open to various objects: from the car to the baker's grounds for the profile.
It is also linked to the online function Autolog, among other things, its own results achieved with those of other comparing players and also provides for more collective functions.
An incomprehensible further blunders is a situation in the last race of the story.
Here is the car in a subway tunnel (nay), where in the dark on the rail rast (nay).
Look at the tachograph paragraphs between 150 (a) 200 km/h (far), but there is even an underground and drives an uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorial, we will still argue about whether it was a blackout of game makers, or whether the authors for dopey.
The technical side is nothing Überwältigendes but at least the visual overall impression is quite appealing, in most cases, and even brilliant.
Even more galling is that the Bildwiederholfrequenz is slowing in some exciting moments and sometimes quite dramatically.
However, particularly the accidents with greater numbers of participation, where a continuous FPS anyway.
The Tonwiedergabe is OK and the Sound Track is a matter of taste.
In a bid to raise such a broad as possible scale rather young audience, a Sound Track, a lá "every little" - but who is buying such a game because of the music?
The overall impression of Need for speed: the run? The feelings are more mixed.
If the game is not diminished by the totally unnecessary mistakes, we can say with great conviction that The run the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But the game is somehow unfinished.
A well done for pleasure, but we should be prepared that these errors with the power of airport lights in the eye.

EU ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativism and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance among the various institutions felt out of whack."
I would not have expected such a hard war flares. "
"It will take five or six years, until the dust settled, and all have become accustomed to their new role," girl Milena Vicenová began, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, quite sharply their lecture at the law faculty.
How seriously it takes the motto "understandable and openly about Europe," it showed in the first part of their presentation, in which it was able to describe the various EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a transparent and understandable way that some Lektor the law faculty of Charles University have been able to envy.
Mrs Vicenová praised the new chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
" Initially, it was criticism that he was to work quietly - a grey civil servant, was not such a role, but I must say that it has ended up every breath, how well he has adopted the cause.
" He is a person who will listen patiently to 27 member states to communicate with them and, in particular, has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
Should I call the new position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said the answer to the question: who is this - the European Union what No? " As an important step for the agreement and better readability of EU policy towards states, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to prohibit us from our Ölmützer Quargel
Mrs Vicenová dedicating the agenda, according to the European Union, and intends to live in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago, describing it as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and the summit meeting for the Eastern Partnership.
They described the fall of the government during the presidency as a big negative, severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
In the words of the ambassador, said it was not just the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis, which is still not quite hectic.
And since the seven-year budget to be approved by the EU, which makes the matter because of the current economic situation much more complicated.
Whether it is a slim and rigorous budget which industries priority countries more and less to be encouraged - all of which are now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls its own slogans with which they came to Brussels: "understandable on Europe."
" If I do something, then it is gräuliche acronym, foreign words and jargon, nobody understands.
How, as a citizen, I actually know whether we are really in Brussels curly or comes round cucumbers and different bananas or whether anyone actually wants to ban the Quargel.
They had the soil, the EU also used in order to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe's two or different speeds in prospect
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation to be euro-sceptic more negative than the positive sides of the issue.
Even more galling is the poor representation of Czechs in European institutions.
The fact that many factors are to blame, including the reluctance of our candidates, whose inability to motivation to write letters and, last but not least, the weak support for the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, they also stressed the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, called the V4.
" Believe me, if a pole or a Hungarian and a Slovak, is in the vicinity, the Frenchman believes beside me: " Hey, what is the heads together - that is already your V4? " And makes a pretty acid grin.
According to Mrs Vicenové expect the EU in the future, especially tough rules for the budgetary policy of the member states.
As real as a "European Federation," it is the idea of a Europe of the two, or even different speeds.
" We have the countries of the euro zone and the countries outside the euro zone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of reinforced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that the countries should work together, and it does not want calm."
"There will be more and more of such institutions, which ultimately on a strong" multi-speed Europe ,"" Mrs Vicenová expected.
In this respect, they also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy, in principle, according to all the issues affecting the whole of the EU must be discussed by all member states, and not just by the countries of the euro zone.
Fire story:
The innovator IBM enters into its second century of its existence
We are looking for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM most closely, then this would be the word ' longevity. "
For the general public, IBM is a synonym for technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although a century has passed since its inception.
The basis for the longevity of her first head - the visionary Thomas J. Watson, H.W.
He argued the slogan, countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people would be willing to consider a bit.
His slogan: ' Think! " Has been a hallmark of the life of the future giants should happen (and, at the same time, the title of the company's internal magazine, when IBM issued in 1935).
This was also the basis of carefully prepared by Watsen business culture.
" For us, from IBM, this long-term thinking means a kontinuelle movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful in a century, because it has remained true to its principles and not hesitates to change everything else around.
This has enabled us to transform in the course of our first-century technology, business and society.
We hope that we create, " said Samuel J. Palmisano, the director of the company to mark the anniversary in the next hundred years.
Thought-out system
Watson ran in the 1930s social care of its employees - in a similar way as entrepreneurs Baťa in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had to be one of the first American employees paid leave insurance through employers, plus elegant uniforms as working clothes and a reasonable salary system for best innovators and traders.
The long-term relationship of IBM are equally subtle with their customers.
The company was brilliant from the outset in the promotion of talent - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM lifted any discrimination - and was able to pick and choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, the Palmisan at the head of IBM in the next year will be swapped by a woman from Virginia Rometty.
It is 30 years at IBM, so far, the position of the head Vetriebs, marketing and strategy.
IBM in recent years, so-called online brainstorm about many future strategies and innovations.
There is no miracle ideas - it is enough, the company employs nearly half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unshakeable position in the business to guarantee the company a strong image, and that domestic and foreign.
"From the outset, IBM had the concept of an institution than a mere technology company," said The Economist, the professor of the Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company, the business to resolve problems through technology helps," added George Colony of Consulting firm Forrester Research.
The company pointed out, there is a difference in the market, only to be present or directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of their logos for the family, "big Blue" has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the more competent technology companies - IBM hardware and software infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all the American technology companies, IBM has the most patents and five of its staff were awarded the Nobel Prize.
His best-known inventions include, for example, bank machines, credit cards, financial swaps, bar code or the Diskette.
With around $220 billion stock market value (market capitalization), IBM was the second-largest technology company (after Apple), for the first time since 1996, Microsoft outdated this year.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations that met the tastes of customers today, unhappy with its own operating system, OS/2 were, for example, the online service Prodigy or the IBM PC computer jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so we must not emotional tie to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That is why IBM has no problem with his reason to build walls on different platforms - and if they do not work, they leave.
Microsoft, in contrast to the opponent, in principle, with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
To participate in the profits of IBM in the greatest degree of services, software and hardware to one-fifth.
In 1990, hardware was still more than most fünfzigprozentigem share.
Since 2000, IBM sold invested little profits for big assets with a value of $15 billion in the same time, however, it is $58 billion in shopping future technologies.
In these investment drives, IBM also continue after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept over the world.
Here, too, IBM was the legacy of his first bosses loyal to Thomas J. Watson, in the midst of the Great Depression, increased its investment.
So far, it appears that the company IBM today's crisis emerges unscathed.
The value of IBM shares rose suddenly since 2008, missiles by 120 percent and profit of the company kontinuell grows.
The company's slogan is IBM: everything can change - not just the values.
Therefore, it is to be expected that this flexible giant pulls the next crisis.
IBM history: space flights from cheese Schneider
The one hundred years ago, society founded in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated names - computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took until 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a plant in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for subsequent IBM society, the merger of four companies, whose history in the 1980s of the 19th century.
They owned technologies such as the famous Stechkartenuhren registration of work begins and ends.
The architects of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, until 1930, the chair of the board.
And it was Flint, the head of the competition, the company stopped Thomas J. Watson, so that helped him in the management of the company.
This Leader was the founder of IBM in the shade - Watson's ideas based until today, the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM began, as the name betrays the manufacture and distribution of all sorts of machinery for the trade of sausages and cheese tailors to cash.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled their sales to $9 million and the company expanded, and on all continents.
Watson was so essential to the company that he was all for forty years in the head, then he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson junior.
Under whose stewardship IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first Programmiersprache.
In the 1960s helped technicians and computer from IBM, NASA to launch flights into space - Mercury and Saturn, and the famous flight of people to the moon in 1969.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the number of IBM System/360 in 1964.
A classic PC, the computer-certain standards of the time, came in 1981 under the IBM 5150 names on the market.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand, they bought the Konsultanten part of the company, PricewaterhouseCoopers and rose entirely in the business with Consulting benefits and services with high added value.
The strategy, IBM is paying off in the last three years, the concept of ' Smarter Planet. "
It embodies the intention to use technologies intelligent in hitherto not planned areas, for example, to improve the situation in transport and urban management.
In the commercial sector, IBM recently led the dealers to help the entire commercial cycle to guide the platform ' Smarter commerce. "
IBM is also in the Czech Republic, a strong story.
Already, in 1932, IBM founded a branch in the former Czechoslovakia - even the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR, among other things, it is also a strategic outsourcing Center in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe, devolve in Prague and is also a top team of researchers from world-class that deals with the technology of voting identification.

The worst female vices: what is it with you?
If the men calls to give some typical female vices, they invariably shake some promptly from the sleeves.
The women you see in the following lines where we let a couple of abuse review, the men of the blood-wallen?
Shopping addiction
Raises their bits to be shopping addiction?
You must be at least a week to buy Hader?
You like to shop and also in action is a bit more?
Then it is really in your case a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of their shopping inclination to try to keep reasonably under control.
But hand on heart, what is there to try to find a well-seated Oberbekleidung only through clothes to bummeln and not all (in all kinds of color combinations in the booth?
Even if the shopping for the majority of women is a hobby for the men, it is often the pure hell.
They think, but how often she said her husband - you really better out there...
Constant discontent
"I am not too fat?"
"I would have to buy at least five kilos - I should begin to go jogging or Gymnastik?"
"I liked you?"
Somehow, they know this?
Yes?
Then you are also among the women, the rule of law are obsessed with how they look.
That is not that you should go, but many men allergic reaction, if their wife whinges about their appearance.
The stronger sex is agreed, the women are always dramatic, with increasing frequency of complaints.
Order and cleanliness in first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Scrub windows, tiles and dust sweep, sparing the bath - and at least twice in the week.
You shout with their partner, because he is again with dirty shoes tramples on clean tiles, you chastise the children, because that is just gescheuerte washing basins already filthy and because the Glastür on the living room cupboard has fingerprints that extrapolate so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviances," then you should know that nothing can exaggerate and order and cleanliness in family life.
This excessive Reinheitsfimmel could ultimately harm the mutual relations, and above all the rest in the family.
Taunting
"Dirty Turnhosen in the laundry basket."
"You want to attract the old socks really tomorrow again?"
"A watery towel raises not simply on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised to learn that he brings to the Palme.
This is clearly not bad, but they just want that everything is in order.
If the men knew this, then the women may not be so much to grumble.
Gossip and novelty
Some clap and women, as getuschelt behind the backs or slandering or forging alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they are lagging issues such as, for example - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, each of us has a little harmless gossip and novelty.
Hand on heart, that is all women.
But that is not to be confused with the major gossip aunts calibre where nobody and nothing is sacred, despise everybody in their environment, and particularly for collective women pose a significant threat.
Jágr and Voráček gave Philadelphia with their junior victory
The ice hockey striker Jaromír Jágr had in Monday's NHL game with two junior large share of the 5-3 victory in Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and here is another productive Czech player in the NHL.

I had somehow feeling. "

The second hit "a Czech trail had a little bit later."
Voráček won behind the door of the Hurricanes the Puck and presented him between the circles, the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second before the Abpfiff reached the first third of the home player Short-Hander Patrick Dwyer, but the second was third, then the Flyers.
Specifically, Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr he reached his third hit, then drew Wayne Simmonds whose shot for the fourth goal.
"I love to play with him."
"I do not want to say that he is the best players in the league, but he is one of the best three," Jágr paid tribute to his Center.
"I would not be in life, that I am playing at the end of my career with such an ice hockey player along with him."
"I am pleased about this huge."
"I am raising my game."
"All those years in the NHL, my players, their game on me, and now turns the tables," Jágr smile.
Carolina turned the game on the drama - the hit of Tuoma Ruutua and Dwyer once again from a penalty shot, there was a door.

In addition to the Candiens losing their Beck also learnt their leadership unverloren in Penalty 2 shooting: 3.
One of the criminal shootings could not turn Tomáš Plekanec.
More painful than the lost points, the coach of the home team the outage-related high sickness on the defensive - the game they played only five defensive players.
"That is a bad thing."
"We played the meeting only with a single experienced players, the rest were young players."
"But there is nothing we can do, so we must be ready," said Jacques Martin.
"Every change of a wave of attacks after the other, and we had nothing."
"We need to simplify the game and the Puck from our third out."
There were still reserves, " said P.K. Subban, one of the defensive players.
The Czech Ondřej gate-keepers Pavelec rejected 30 shots from Tampa Bay and contributed greatly to the 5-2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which had a series of five defeats ended five different shooter.
Development of the travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five in the then ČSSR approved state travel agents: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agents then sold mainly only travel in the socialist bloc countries in the West were only exclusivity.
And Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea in the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), the Soviet Union (Sochi, on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea, after Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea, and an end to Hungary.
A silver exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when they travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia proposed a pro-Western course and were severely restricted travel to Yugoslavia.
It was a great paradox of socialist times that it is not even citizens of the Soviet bloc (including the Tschechoslowaken) has been allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
If a citizen of the ČSSR individually to Poland, for example, or even wanted to travel to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise were individual travel impossible.
Even then, the travel agents also had to travel to the West, but then you take huge queues in purchasing or spend sleeping bags before the travel office, or at least "good friend" in the travel office.
So the matter was still a long way.
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit in the West - has only been "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel.
Czechoslovakia's currency was not freely exchangeable currency without foreign commitment, it would have been impossible to find the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The long journey most Czechs therefore spent their holidays at home, it is no wonder that the Czechs countless weekend bought homes and dachas - a habit that has lasted until today.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a trip revolution of the Czechs on the foot.
During a holiday until 1989 in the GDR or in Bulgaria, the measure of all things, the Czechs spent last year, 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries throughout the world.
A huge paradox, today is not aware of the fact that it is able to travel to the currently popular holiday destination of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989, not at all, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
From the beginning of the 1990s in the last century, the foreign exchange requirement lifted in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe, a huge wave of short visit, especially after Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Tschechoslowaken were able to get enough for a long time to travel to the West, not everyone wanted to be at least a couple of days.
The Czech slept holidaymakers travelling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have had at the time the money for a shelter in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature of foreign travel by Czechs was a vollgepackter boot with canned beer and permanent sausages, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of free umtauschbaren Czech crown after decades of our tourists were finally free to buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and the average salaries, which in 1997 led another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel began to travel agents regularly after 1997 to prepare for travel by charter flights, the air travel, thanks to the ability to negotiate volume discounts, compared to the past subsidized unbelievable.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already devisenlosen payments with all advanced countries in the world, what travel easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "post-velvet" travel came in 2000, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight was processed in an exotic country - Thailand.
Since then, each year to fly direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers in distant sunny countries; this year it flies directly from the Czech Republic, twelve exotic destinations.
The 100 Tsd. Czechs travel every year in exotic countries!
Another important moment in the era of our "post-revolutionary" marked development in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States join the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country under the advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent the first time, more than half their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in its history for a single holiday residence, including the cost of the holiday destination, more than 15 Tsd. CZK per capita.
The main assembly should find a new chairman - a stalemate.
Almost five months for the Czech football has no chairman and that the successor will be aware of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), not even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
Until now, there is still no agreement about what should be chosen electoral law.
And without that, there is no vote on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, came Hašek from his role, and he called on his colleagues in the departure had to agree to find a strong personality, which could pass the football in the future.
Only in the era after Hašek broke the old squabbles between the two chambers class again, unable to agree on a joint candidate.
That became clear on 16 September, should be selected as the new chairman.
The delegates of the main assembly were free of the People's House in Prague Smíchov quarter, because the trial led to no result and it was not just the election itself.
We could not agree on who is actually in the full collection is entitled to vote - only the statutory representatives or equipped with power officials.
In this single point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute for the state and the law, which makes a representation on a full basis is not.
The disputes about the electoral law, however.
The executive committee also brought more clarity on the issue in meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle, nothing else is on the agenda.
Even if the views in relation to the election of a couple of times changed - the nerve centre remained the same.
The question is: what should we do in the third round, in order to avoid a stalemate?
"The sticking point is the question of whether we should act in line with the statutes, or whether a different model must be found," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairman of the FAČR firmly in the management of the professional football.
According to a registered model prevails in the third round of the one candidate, the greater prozentuelle support in the chamber, for which he is standing.
Moravia is supposed to be ready to respond to the compromise that candidate win the higher number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech side is on the condition that the victor in this than in any other vote count at least a two-thirds majority.
"The two Vorrunden would make no sense, this mode, the whole concept bicameral," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side to choose the best, the electoral law cannot be bent, but under current statutes.
This is also true, surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík, even if that statutory legitimate election of all the candidates most likely to think Pelta.
"It is my wish that largely after the statute."
"No nonsensical concocted ersatz variants, such as at the last meeting," said the owner of football clubs Plzeň) Victoria, who is standing for the first time in his opinions, especially to Pelta demarcated.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In his view, the new chairman in Nymburk be known, and he believes that the candidates work together constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European Football Championships today would certainly help to calm the emotions."
"If the football is on the euphoric wave, the willingness to cooperate more," according to the official from Jablonec by all three Adepten brings the most experience on both a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately, the situation is ambivalent."
" It is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts to " zurechtzubiegen ' own purposes. "
"Therefore, it is not ruled out a new blockage in the main assembly."
"However, I hope that common sense prevails in the end," said Rajchl.
Just a lot of time left on the agreement by all sides.
Some negotiations should be completely allegedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football's generals until the qualification game at all.
The charter plane, which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl after Podgorice fly, on the morning in Prague because of a technical malfunction did not launch sought for a replacement option as part of the executive committee, but the venue of the Barrage-Hinspiels.
Ultimately, then, is the crucial meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the minister for education, youth and physical education would have liked to have moved the divided parties within the largest sports associations in the country to an agreement.
It is a lot at stake: state grants Vertrauungswürdigkeit Czech football and also the main assembly of the ČSTV the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka's new direction.
Paclík in the battle for the position of the chairman, because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers before the extraordinary general meeting would represent a strong candidate of the Czech Republic (FAČR) all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association, he would not allow the fight to this top position.
"If there would be a good candidate, then I would fight for him and for the election."
"But in the current situation, it is not managed to find a Adepten," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, so it is to prevent the alleged favourites of the election, Pelta, arrived at the head of the FAČR.
Paclík also stressed that he plans to exercise if he wins the role of the chairman, only a year, until 2013, until the date of the extraordinary general meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would like to hear a top managers seen not involved in the football.
"I have personally spoken with a number of eligible people."
" Hard to believe that some said they were currently not identify with the Czech football.
 "Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most disturbing of all Paclík allegedly linking Pelta's influence with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to delegate votes at general meetings.
It is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta the position of the chairman, held for Paclík.
"His victory would einkonserviert today and in the Czech football, it is not at all."
"The support Berbr a clever Businessman, the doubly bad football," Paclík stressed.
Here he plays that Pelta's name some time ago in connection with phone taps on the investigation in a corruption affair, but from the Pelta unpunished.
"I do not know what the prestige of a victory by Pelta (tsch) should bring in football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta chairman," but a little more calmly.
Paclík should win in Thursday's election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Just thinks another candidate - Rajchl, Paclík before the General Assembly had supported in October, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first, I would go."
"He has great skills."
"I could well imagine him as head of the national team."
"But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager."
"I have my nose in matters, which I understand nothing," said Paclík in September for publicity, that he was behind the recall of the referee Luďěk Macela Commission was at the helm, Dagmar Damková replaced.
Paclík claims that he felt the role of the association chairman.
And holding up his skills in the management of private firms since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, celebrated with his support in May, the first triumph in the league.
"I have the power to do something to change in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal commissions, which resulted in sickening situations to degenerate," Paclík, no secret of his antipathy for example to the Sparta chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of its priorities he would strengthen relations between the FAČR and Czech Olympic Committee, which he would lobbyieren political leaders for more money from the lottery tax in the sport.
"It is one of the key things, the new chairman should pay."
"If we play on the taxation of happiness, as the political parties, then I understand their reasoning, but they must also be clear where the money goes," he said.
His link to the Pilsner club Paclík is also not a handicap, although he stressed, the chairman of the FAČR must be "bipartisan."
Pelta, in turn, is linked to Jablonec, Rajchl with Dukla Prague.
"It is not ideal."
"I think it does not make much sense to transfer my shares Pilsner club hypocritical on a third-person return after one and a half years," said Paclík clear.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, ausschlössen a stalemate in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association promised to be one of the candidates for the chairman, Miroslav Pelta, he will be in the event of his choice for the FAČR gets new statutes in future disputes over the electoral law to exclude from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiation in Nymburk and believes the campaign will ensure a success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had promised before the unrealised election in September, he wants to focus in the event of his election to the national team and the extraction of financial resources.
He decided at the last minute to take part in the election before the last general meeting and might help him the two-month break, to defend his ideas on the management of football and in a broader context.
"People are devoted to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman on Thursday is known at all levels."
" He feels that it is high time that the association is led by someone who believes the man is primarily associated with the Jablonecer club, but also for many years in Sparta and acted in the executive committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to guide the Czech football.
He is convinced that responsible for today's problems with the election of the euphoria is at the time of Ivan Hašek.
" Unfortunately, were approved at the general meeting in June, which were not as full as it had all been adopted.
If they are not allowed to different interpretations, we have had a chair, " said Pelta.
He used the revision of the most important document of the citizens ' association as bait for the delegates.
"I should be chairman, then I take it personally, and I am willing to bear personal responsibility if it does not work."
"It is a matter of principle, without which he cannot be," said Pelta.
In addition, he is not trying to define his opponent.
He had already announced that he could imagine a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl he recognizes his legal education, and he knows that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He also Tomáš Paclík took no more, no dry thread to Pelta.
In football, he is more than a year and can already point to some successes. "
"His attacks were unworthy and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"Now doubt many of its true nature," addressed Pelta his opponent, faithful to his proclamations, which he has already expressed in September.
In his view, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest divisions, national team.
And this should be the flagship Czech football.
"I would also try to stop all affair - from the Bohemians to the echo of the corruption scandal last year."
"Then I would plunge negotiations with private and public sector in order to ensure sufficient financial resources for the whole of football," said the forty-six year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
He also promised that his arrival at the tip of the Czech football will mean no personal cleansing.
"I would have to start with the labour content of all employees," he said in the direction of the Strahov, where the long anarchy is understandably nervous.
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios, which accompany the main assembly, he believes that the delegates are not wasted on Thursday after Nymburk.
"If we really ought to be the only point of contention in the third round, then we will."
"Football needs credibility and he wins only if he has a new leader," Pelta two days before the potentially decisive day of his career officials optimistic.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR hard to work under him begins
When the deputy chairman of Jindřich Rajchl should be elected at the General Assembly on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, which would allegedly spoiled many people in the club's whim.
Rajchl promises that we are working hard in the event of his election to begin.
He wants to introduce the system changes, and the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football fields.
He also promised to resolve the case of Bohemians to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA to bring more money into the football and to continue the work of the previous presiding Ivan Hašek has begun.
"As chairman, I would like to dedicate the football as a whole."
Starting from the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, on the national selection, professional football, football performance for the youth. "
"I am not saying that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in talks for ČTK.
"I am a team player and I would therefore like to distribute the powers in the executive committee, so that each member pays a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks, so that the football in each segment at a time. "
Moreover, many were delighted not to criticize because they, rather than just the work of others, now really ought to work hard, " he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement have taken into consideration, not to run again.
"I know that I am working 20 hours a day."
"But I must know that it makes sense that people are behind me, I am not constantly spokes and every step, I am in," he said as an explanation of why he hesitated.
"Many people have told me that I would not give up, because others do."
"It is confidence, we must not squander," he said.
He allegedly motivated him, to continue the work, which began under Hašek.
"We have a great deal of work done in two years, and now I am not just throw away."
"It has been launched processes only in a couple of years and I would hate to see that someone stopp," he said, and expresses its concern that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta elected, the situation in the days before Hašek could return.
"I believe in systematic approach, and that is something not Mirek Pelta."
"Behind him, above all, people would make football so that he would be only for exclusivity."
I think we can accuse some, but not that I would be biased. "
"I am trying to be objective."
"I want to football for everybody, because it all goes well, and not just the man," said Rajchl.
It also contradicts the claim that he was only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people claim to do the opposite, I really have the best possible result for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and Moravian, whose winners in each of the first league felt."
"It might not happen today, only three Moravian clubs play in the league, particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem," says Rajchl.
Because the head of the Tomáš Pilsner clubs Paclík has joined the battle for the role of the chairman, Rajchl dares not to assess his chances that he will be elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has been elected to its vice-chairman and now recognises that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl led to the saving of tens of millions of kronor on disadvantageous contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as a success.
On the other hand, it is partly the fault of the association, not in a single direction.
While Pelta, he says, "he was disqualified from the outset, the Czech football with greater confidence," he considers the second rivals - Paclík for a strong candidate, the football really have something to offer.
"Nobody can question in Pilsen in just one year has done an excellent job."
"He should be elected, he would probably things continue, Ivan Hašek has started and the personnel in the commissions he would obviously not change radically."
He would certainly not want altered just to suit in his favour, " Rajchl judging on his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Leap in the dark
By Julia Stanek
Planschbecken in Ufo-optics, " bling pools in Budapest, who can travel through Europe, with a shock - and after a tour of cities or migration to rest the tired legs in Sprudelbädern.
A book shows where wellness in the water is the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder in the past year and a half of research trip, was not lacking in their luggage: her bathing costume.
Rücklings on water, they looked into art shaped cupolas, they swam marble-Putten, the peripheral basins were waiting for them, and was amazed on meticulously restored from Jugendstilschwimmhallen.
She liked a bath, she took it in great haste, in her book notice - office knowledge values details about the design and history of the building.
More than 200 pools are finding architecture historian Meder in this way - and it is now in her published book "bathing pleasures": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus region near Frankfurt.
Thirteen countries by their "journey to the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a real culture of bathing enthusiasts.
They do not have much in the hat with sports, says Meder - only in the water.
Annoying that swimming fans come with blue Kacheln and chlorine smell, while Jogger inhale the betörenden smell of Fichtenwäldern or happy Vogelgezwitscher listening in the park.
"One day I asked myself why swimming pools must always be ugly," says Meder living in Vienna.
"So I began to collect beautiful spas."
Surface water doubled architecture
The Wellness factor in bathrooms Geplätscher in leap basins and essential sauna oils - is so great, because all sense, so Meder.
And if the builders have been trouble swimming halls can be a real Augenschmaus: "instead of a floor in dipping water surface."
"It is transparent, but on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All doubles blend: high vaults, colorful Kacheln, boards leap.
The kleinformatige picture band gives "bathing pleasures" 190 pages on the value of knowledge about the historic architecture and cultural history of wellness-oases - but especially for a leap in the dark.
Remarkable specimens discovered the pool Meder collector with her research in Hungary.
Alongside magnificent medical spas, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi-Bad in Budapest was a nitrathaltiges waters in a urigen Karsthöhle (Höhlenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a Thermalbad, whose basin filled with alkalihaltigem water in bottles shaped buildings (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular prospects, however, offer many free heated pools in Switzerland and Austria, while the Zurich Dachbad the entire city, you can see in the external pool of Bads in St Anton on the snow-covered Arlberg look - and, in Dampfbad, there is a window from the activities at the ski Piste.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design expects bathers in length of the field: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a landed in the Alps Ufo.
Three dampft open nuts in the winter, while in the background, the mountains of the Ötztals excel in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal spas smell after sulphur in the Árpád-bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba stinks to be so strong for fuel oil, which is difficult to believe in a Gesundheitsbad landed.
The smell comes from the hydrogenkarbonathaltigen alkali water cure, it is almost black and Schlick a stain on the skin, once you are sliding into the pool - a wellness-experience special article
In a place was Iris Meder in their search for beautiful bathing sites but also disappointed: they wanted to visit the free and the period of time in the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz, they found a locked terrain.
From 1902 Dušan Jurkovic architects shaped bath has now been closed.
As Meder a glance through the verwitterten windows of the red-white-yellow youth-style building, she saw how weeds has grown between the tiles.
The decline has worked into a swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais spa in Wildbad bath.
Three construction schedules has discovered this bad already; you can't just neoromanische elements from the time of its construction in 1844, but also a maurische hall in Alhambra-style, which was added around 1900.
Since 1995, thorough modernization is the Palais spa that Lieblingsbad the pool knowledge Meder iris - and not only because they originally comes from the Black Forest.
"It is quite an achievement to merge different Baustile at such a great unity," says Meder.
It is such a palace of the Tauchgang in spa pool only sideshow.
Agricultural speculation
German bank leaves commodity business by lights
Christian Teevs
Deutsche Bank is on their business with agricultural commodities?
After SPIEGEL-ONLINE information Josef Ackermann asked a working group to examine the impact of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the company chief want to draw conclusions.
Hamburg -
The matter is clear for the German citizens: 84 percent of Germans think it is not acceptable, according to a study that banks with agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of the respondents even demand that the Deutsche Bank and other lenders from this business, because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report that Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
The author shows Harald Schumann that bets on global stock exchanges, commodity prices - and the banks are therefore an accessory on global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protector is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, even if big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley.
Commodity bets were originally intended for traders against price fluctuations.
But most experts agree that the gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors reacted Ackermann to the criticism: he promised to investigate the allegations and said that no business it is "worth the good name of the Deutsche Bank to gamble."
According to the information provided by SPIEGEL ONLINE an International Labour is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch Report.
The review to be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank, with a recommendation on how this should be handled.
At the end of January, the then head of the bank say what consequences.
In the end, could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann fusses over his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time, his criticism of the financial industry: "betting on rising food prices illustrates dramatically as reckless banks of the public."
Ackermann stand as a top bank lobbyist now, particularly in the duty.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all plants from its portfolio, where money will be used to take bets on food prices," said Bode.
"Regardless of whether it is Mr Ackermann hunger suffering people or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
The understanding of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the company chief a few months before his departure from office would make a perfect picture.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO differently than planned, will not change in the board.
With a move away from the controversial agricultural speculation he could be pumping up his image.
And possible losses he needs very little to do - after all, could have his successor.
Every second would terminate commodity assets
Foodwatch trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30000 Internet users in the campaign of the organisation.
On Tuesday, Bode published the poll, for which the institute Forsa 1001 people interviewed on 7 and 8 November.
Just 11 percent think it is legitimate that the Deutsche Bank facilities, where bets on food prices.
Many bank customers would also be personal consequences when they learn that their bank involved in such transactions: half of the poll, according to terminate all installations where money is flowing into commodity speculation.
43% would advise acquaintances of such a bank to cancel 49% to reflect their accounts and to switch to another institution.
21er house in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with highs, lows and happy endings: the Austrian World Expo pavilion from Brussels in 1958, won prizes in Vienna museum was empty and descended.
Now, he will be re-opened as an exhibition.
If dreams of modern postwar architecture, clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials, which are typical for the belief in the technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of Karl Schwanzer architects for the Brussels World Expo in 1958, a striking and famous example.
Tail pavilion at the Grand Prix d ' Architecture for his easy and pending operates steel-glass design.
The building is now a landmark contemporary architecture.
He made the architects know that Austria at the next World Expo pavilion built.
It was 1973, finally internationally famous with his legendary BMW Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem side in Munich.
His planned as a temporary exhibition pavilion had converted one of the world exhibition at the Swiss garden at the Vienna Südbahnhof, and in 1962, it opened a museum of the 20th century - the 1920s house it was called.
It was likely the building but neither physically and technically as a museum - no walls on the slopes of the art, not a good climate.
Nevertheless, it has been used for so long, until the contemporary art in Vienna, a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz converted the pavilion, he now says, "21er House" and will be used as a museum of contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening, the museum opened Belvedere, the house is the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in all respects.
Through the restart Agnes Husslein-Arco, in 2007, the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, holders of art historian with considerable career in the youth as Eiskunstläufererin later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and a founding director of the Museum of modernity Salzburg, converting strongly among politicians and conservationists monument, they acquired public funds and private sponsors ' money and use.
Should contemporary art works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba issued by the eponymous foundation, there should be a cafe and a bookshop, and an office house had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
The implementation was Krischanitz the ideal occupation.
Not only because of its sensitive converted Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna and expanded and won the competition, but because he has studied in Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him was an "incredibly important place" where he was "almost every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the Ur-draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which is already in its transfer to Vienna and lost his Umnutzung of generosity and lightness.
The current renovation, there were far greater problems: the building was "a Energieschleuder," says Krischanitz.
The windows profiles of the glass facade have changed, enhanced fiber glass insulation and the glass roof replaced by special security glass.
Bridges cold steel makers have been strengthened or replaced, and asbestos-filled blankets have been refurbished.
Two -got room for the new use, a reduced light gap between house and road for Belichtung, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the easy Schwanzer pavilion.
The original external doors are removed, the house is in the old rotbraunen rust protection Farbton.
And the cinema is even exactly as it was before.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found, that is a good thing, and it is cheap and Denkmalschutzamt liked," says Krischanitz and highlights an abrasive ground in -.
Despite all the constraints, problems and improvements to the building is flexible and easy.
It is been difficult with the pavilion, " daherkam from Brussels, " said Krischanitz recently, a typical ' Drop-in-the-City history. "
So an architecture "always in the wrong place," and still wants to "create a real awareness."
In this case, the 21er house, however, is not entered in the wrong place, because it is an urban fluke: around the Swiss garden is just completely planned ' Central Station Quartier ' office and residential buildings.
And another fluke may still happen: the 21er households could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporäre art hall, and we hear that it is negotiating with the city a neighbourly location within the Swiss garden.
Rail plans winter crisis package in millions
The railway has mapped out a crisis plan, which is intended to prevent Zugausfälle in winter.
The number of staff should be doubled.
It will cost millions.
The Deutsche Bahn, a newspaper report this year, more than 70 million euros in addition in the fight against winter-related Zugausfälle and delays.
The "picture" newspaper previously reported, citing an internal corporate crisis plan investments were provided by a total of around EUR 300 million by 2015.
This should be achieved a better availability of vehicles and the rail network in extreme weather.
Is planned, among other things, a doubling of the internal and external staff for snow removal on rail facilities and rail increase to 16000 people.
Goal is to liberate platforms until the company start and 90 per cent of operating necessary choices within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, had warned rail chief Rudiger pit after a top meeting with government and industry Zugausfällen and delays in this winter.
Last winter, the railway passenger transport significant problems, since it has, among other things, difficult weather conditions, a lack of reserves.
Many wait for new regional trains for years for a licence from the Federal Railway Administration.
There is also a delay in the extradition of ICE-trains.
The railway also makes for years to create that they examine axes of ICE-trains significantly more frequently in the garage, after ICE in Cologne Central Station had axes.
German bank pays millions of punishment in the United States
After the brouhaha surrounding chief Josef Ackermann is new hardships from the United States: the Deutsche Bank must pay a million repentance.
The problems at home for the Deutsche Bank would not be enough, the industry giants, now his past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays in a comparison of $145 million (EUR 106 million) to settle disputes because of the collapse of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial market regulator NCUA raises a number of big banks, have led the cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; they have played down the risks.
Such papers lost heavily during the financial crisis and the banks in depth.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties before the court," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank admitted the comparison not to blame.
It also applies to Citigroup, the payment of $20.5 million.
The NCUA chairman Debbie Matz, welcomed the gesture of the two houses of money.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US cooperative banks and bounces in bankruptcies, in order to protect the customer deposits.
The NCUA tried to replace the billions of severe damage.
The now closed comparisons are the first.
The regulator had also attacked other big banks and sued in the summer of JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The questionable mortgage securities are so-called mortgage-backed Securities.
These loans are based.
When the housing bubble burst in 2007, it was a wide range of financial firms fatal.
At the height of the financial crisis, to overturn the US investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008.
Even if the events of a few years ago, the banks are blowing a sharp wind in the United States.
Investors and regulators have brought countless complaints in order to receive compensation or to punish misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest complaint wave.
It raises 18 large international banks, the two state US housing financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage transactions in the overbearing volume of around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also needs to make a complaint to the FHFA, it is about several shops worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The regulator demanded that the "substantial losses," without, however, to give a precise figure.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and declared to defend themselves.
Warren Buffett increases with 10 billion IBM
Financial guru Buffett invested heavily into IBM IT companies.
Since March he has shares bought more than $10 billion.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett agreed to invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of the firms predict poorly.
Now, however, he read the reports from IBM and changed his views about investments in the industry.
He had much earlier must understand that IBM mainly offer services and computer systems for IT departments to acquire other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett, is regarded as a knight in the financial world.
Consequently, the IT primitive IBM "IBM Sir."
Because Buffett revealed in the US broadcaster CNBC that he bought since March, IBM shares with a value of 10.7 billion dollars.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has become one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM now knew anything about the commitment.
He praised the management, even in the economic crisis had decent profits.
"They have done an excellent job," said Buffett's strategy.
IBM sets for a long time on the lucrative IT Services as the operation of data centres.
More than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice and powerful computer firms.
Buffett had shunned technology firms, hitherto.
He says he only invest in companies whose business, he also understand.
Instead, Buffett took around a rail freight, a lubricant producers or machinery farmers.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns alongside around 80 own subsidiaries also shares in a number of major corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich back.
The 81-year-olds had developed in the 1960s, the small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway and with wise investment to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
It is for many investors in the world, a cult figure.
His almost unmistakable sense of earning money has brought him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
After the announcement of Buffett investments rose conceded the IBM share one per cent.
"Big Blue," as IBM is known, is in the stock market as a whole, more than $220 billion worth and counts along with Apple and Microsoft, the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he is not.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is real
After the discovery of " Zwickauer cell ' Turkish media in the German state of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" now resurgent.
The murders of eight Turkish ethnic and Greek small entrepreneurs in the years 2000-2006, had a legal extremist background.
This news will be in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany reacted with fear and concern.
For many German türken returns in a long totgeglaubtes ghost: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with legal extremist background against Turks.
That in Germany there is xenophobia, however, was never in question.
This revealed right-wing extremist network reveals, however, proportions, whose dimension is still a long way.
"The bloody ideology lives again?" The headline in the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper, "Haber Turk."
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, stressed that one of the perpetrators have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and expresses concern that German authorities could be involved in the radical right quagmire.
She calmly responded the Turkish community of Germany: remembered at the weekend with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate, the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks earlier had thought the Turkish community in Berlin with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish Anwerbeabkommens.
In cheery colours was orchestrated coexistence - a history of success.
As a slap in the face because the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the Fünfzigsten" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform, "Haber X," cites the background to the series of murders.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" it is not to take these ideas.
"It starts to stink," the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people have been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany have done with their work.
It will be extremely critical discussion in German Turkish Internet forums, the actions of the police and later investigative success.
Why the German authorities is not much more, to look for suspects in extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Some shows, at least rhetorically, to drastic measures: "will continue to be done here, the migrants have no other option than self-defence and weapons."
"This is probably the best self-protection."
"The quality of the Enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the internal peace in Germany," writes "selenium."
What it means when the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks demonstrated by Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photograph of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living more apparent that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans, that can lead to mistrust and distance in right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, raised their feelings on the Turkish side.
Not to repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press was particularly criticised the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President, however, represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the funeral in Cologne - Kinkel was in his speech on how many charges for domestic Turks.
As calculated the value of a human after its tax levies.
The current coverage of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the domestic law since then.
In addition to the efforts of a wide-ranging education and re-evaluation of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany needs open words this time.
The bank scandal by Zürisee
The bizarre bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS was almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then has been reeling from one crisis to the next.
It is now a German.
So it was Axel Weber, certainly not.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank was known in July that he would be 2013, an almost equally spectacular new job: President of the Council of the Swiss large bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was publicly praised Switzerland their beauty and UBS whether their newfound solidity and friendly comments about the future colleagues.
"UBS has managed the Turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September, it became clear that everything would be different.
A UBS trader in London had been gambling found all security systems of the bank and approximately 1.7 billion euros.
UBS-CEO Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland's vaunted bankers had to go.
The UBS board president since also - and everyone is asking: when is Axel Weber?
Already, it became known that Weber advised the bank from February 2012.
And the administrative presidency in May - not only in 2013, the bank said on Tuesday.
This will be hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, much more economics professor and central bankers, and would have had an apprenticeship period certainly needed.
At a stroke, he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again proved that they have long been the title of largest bank scandal of Europe ."
Because UBS is huge - until recently, it was the largest asset managers in the world - and on the other hand, has been reeling for years by a scandal in the next.
Nothing, it seems, the once-proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the secretive and solid, but also savvy Swiss asset manager she had combined with ambitious targets: they also wanted to be in the investment banking is a very big number.
The UBS managed in 2007 with $1.6 trillion more money with significant customers than any other bank in the world.
And, on the other hand, it was as investment bank proceeded into the league of the world's largest banks.
This made impression.
The former banker and subsequent long-standing banking professor in Zurich, Hans Geiger told: "my students, I have the UBS always depicted as a model of good banking."
"From today's point of view, one wonders: how could I be wrong?"
He wrongly huge.
For the first time that something belonging went wrong in the UBS in 2007.
The middle of the year was surprising CEO Peter Wuffli, which was seen as highly intellectual and ingenious bankers.
A few months later, suspecting, why he was gone.
The investment division of the bank had been gambling found with subprime securities and had to write off billions.
In order to shoulder, UBS announced a capital increase to the tune of 13 billion francs.
It was actually investors, but what about some until shortly before the gerümpft nose: a dark Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund, which was so quiet that not even his name.
But that was only the first blow.
It was worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, Board President Marcel Ospel, 2006, the second-best paid board of Switzerland came back.
In October 2008, followed by the disaster: UBS was given its bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank of UBS bought problematic for tens of billions of securities, the Swiss Confederation was six billion francs for a compulsory convertible loan, they could be Miteigentümerin of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because they said how dramatic it is for a small country, if it accommodates large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet was the UBS in 2007, more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We could not save the UBS," banking researcher Geiger says.
The first disaster of the second.
A few months later, the UBS surrendered in tax dispute with America and prepared to publish the data with significant customers, perhaps with the help of the bank taxes evaded.
They also agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars as repayment of unjustified profits from this business office criminal surcharge.
The UBS known more or less open to tax evasion.
At the same time, they lost something that has always been their capital was in competition for wealthy clients: an aura of secrecy.
After the scandal was the Swiss banking secrecy is no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of CEO and board president.
And the exodus of customers ' money.
The bank had lost in two key areas of business within a few months of their credibility: investment banking through the speculation and asset management assistance to tax evasion.
And it was a little calmer, just when it was thought the UBS will been gambling found it again, there is this unfortunate dealer history: an individual trader EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank notes that something is amiss.
And it seems to be: with the risk management in the investment banking work obviously still not.
"With the case Adoboli has found that the risk control, little has changed," says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial board of a major German bank is safe: "the problem is the UBS, that they will not risk control under control."
It was precisely the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers taken a long time ago, the guardian of the great assets of the world: no great risks for safety for money - may also break the world beyond the Alpine republic.
The coffers of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich, fits the stereotype of the upright Swiss private bank - it is just a little bit bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters in Zurich station road, which leads from the main train station from directly to the Zürichsee, flanked by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
As jeweller Tiffany's place here between Swiss traditional shops as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, the Swiss banks: from the National Bank on the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bear.
The UBS reception hall enters through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are dressed marble, are thick leather armchairs, in addition to the bank's logo is a great sign for ' safe '.
The UBS knows what the customer: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank have both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but eventually supplanted - or betrayed, as the head of a small private Swiss bank.
His name, he would prefer not to read in the newspaper, finally, he, like all Swiss bankers, even with the two big banks do business.
The UBS is far too big, it will take place - particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And if they have already adapted to the habits of the Anglo-Saxons."
Indeed, it was modified the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, UBS, its high profits and induced the debacle: no European financial institution has lost a lot of money in the sub-jungle as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster has been visible on 15 October 2008.
"On that Wednesday, the coalition government of the small Siebenmillionenlandes the biggest bailout in the history of their nation," writes the author Hässig Lukas, in his book, "the UBS-crash."
Up to 68 billion francs, or roughly EUR 45 billion allocated to the politicians, the bankruptcy to save large bank.
How could this happen?
When you talk with Swiss bankers, so they can see the problem, especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, joined by two of the three major Swiss banks to a huge corporation.
There was a bank when the merger was too big for the small Swiss - and grew.
It helped that the two different precursor-supplemented banks UBS: a rich, but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and poorer, but more internationalized.
Suddenly the internationalised favourable investment bankers at a lot of money, they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, the group's head of UBS, Marcel Ospel, the chairman of the board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, higher intellectual, modest, a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man has worked from the bank lesson to the very top."
But Ospel was finally left to Wuffli.
And Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake at the end: "he thought his models are the reality," says Geiger.
"It is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: frolic came before the fall.
UBS employees remember clearly the leadership meetings where company chief Wuffli the same purported slogan: Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They led the League Tables, " rankings, which documented the success of the banks of the time.
In the meantime, the UBS, according to the top.
Some steps were already succeeded.
In the foreign exchange business and equity trading, she played at the top.
Corporate advisers who have been charged, but a weakness: international business interest in the language of bankers ' Fixed-income, " there is a huge gap with the largest banks.
The UBS have gaps in US mortgage products.
In order to close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that almost cost the existence.
Hungry for growth, invested both the bank itself, as well as a liberating in their hedge funds in the US sub-prime assets.
It became a huge machine, packaged securities on American mortgage loans and reached - but also maintained risks.
Also, when other banks exit.
"In the summer of 2007, when the US housing market was going up in flames, UBS has bought," says banking expert Geiger.
The euphoria is so deep.
A manager to go after the other, more difficult than the attempts to clean up than thought.
Posts in UBS were Schleudersitz and shaky until today.

Smart crow in cities
In many places, apply Saatkrähen: from the cities, the highly intelligent animals no longer drive, say experts, as a "problem of birds."
One, they want to quickly get rid of the other: belong to crow for centuries on the city, but in many municipalities, residents are mounting complaints about dirt and noise of the animals.
It is a tool against the problem of birds, " not yet in sight.
Saatkrähen were not out of the cities, said experts at the first Krähensymposium in ostfriesischen empty.
There consulted experts from across the federal territory on possible ways.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
Conservationists led the problems in towns and cities on the exodus of overprotected Saatkrähen: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroyed the traditional habitats.
The hunt, increased building and typical nesting trees made the birds.
Crow are under the protection of nature.
Large colonies, with more than 600 couples nesting there, among other things in the Westphalian Soest, in the north-west, among other things, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen and empty.
There was a controversial project in 2005, the mass killing of crow in the district for negative-headlines.
Critics had called the trapping of the animals in the birds and the Erschlagen with cudgels as particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the Vergrämen brings nothing," the city and landscape designers Werner Klöver has found from empty.
Wegspritzen nests with water or trees, often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are soft, large colonies divide and spread to other areas."
Vergrämung only as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, they are not getting more."
Without the periphery is not solve the problem in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang waiter from empty.
It could be a combination of Vergrämen animals from sensitive residential areas and tempting offers to resettle elsewhere.
' Info panels instead of canvassing chain saws, " the psychologist and Ethnologin Uta Maria Jürgens for an entirely different way of dealing with the animals, " Pickel in the face, we can tolerate the best self-confidence. "
Jürgens had founded in Schleswig-Holstein, the ash Berger crow-teaching path, notices about the lives of the highly intelligent Saatkrähen.
The project will now have already adopted by tourists.
Also on the criticism of the noise of birds Jürgens had its own opinion: "there is a lot of communication, which have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Saatkrähen use not only tools in order to get a biscuit, but as a tool of their tool even themselves.
Behavioral researchers at Cambridge University recently tested four Saatkrähen, how far does the intelligence of the birds.
In an experiment learned quickly the birds that they need to get with a structure to collapse in order to reach a Mottenlarve.
Without much training, they have pursued what size and shape of a stone to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt to solve the smart crow a trickier problem.
In a vertical set Zylinder had the researchers placed a small Eimerchen with a Mottenlarve.
With the beaked birds were unable to reach their prey.
However, the researchers had them pieces of wire.
It formed a catch, then Eimerchen on grip from the phial of angling all four animals.
Three of the four Saatkrähen managed even straightaway.

Mass slaughter on a personal level
Sensitive and generous Peter Englunds begins new book, "beauty and a history of the First World War, tells in nineteen fates," with a long list of the main people to heart.
Here is a tip on how to proceed: you are mentioning this cautious side and you make it to your readers.
They will be deprived of these people in Englunds romanhafter narrative get to know each other very well, and these people are your GPS function as a beacon in these few moments, in which you Englunds men and women in the fog of war and your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he is not incorrect as "a work of anti-history."
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles, there is little ambassadors, racing reporter or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he says, but rather "a book about how it was." It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and sentiments."
"Beauty and horror" almost 20 war experience of more or less innocuous men and women on both sides of the war of school girls and Botanikern to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people are heroes.
Some prisoners of war, losing limb, crazy or die.
Each of these lives come as the Votivkerzen in a church, some added, while others fade away.
Englunds book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrected the idea of the First World War was just devastating positions of war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and horror" ends with a view of experts on other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the Ostfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are bees baskets, celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse fly an intractable problem.
This is almost from the outset, a very moving book.
The war flooded the lives of these people as a natural disaster like a hurricane Katrina, reeks of Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who stay at home with their children, and cannon fire in the distance. You or you take the flight?
Anyone at all?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war at all.
"The lack of facts," Englund says, "have been improved with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Beauty and horror" individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army and Richard root, a young German ship sailors.
Their stories were mainly memories, letters and other published material.
Their reports can be frightening or simple, but they are very much alive in the Englunds depreciating accumulation in details of small moments.
Many of them act of shortages and bush redress.
In the history of a German school girl, he told: "spare everywhere."
"Spare coffee, wrong aluminium, false Radiergummi, paper associations, wood buttons."
He told the dinner in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and cooked in Hammelfett (and most recently served with a false bone from wood), tobacco, made from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes, besohlt timber."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered food replacement funds were allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511; registered coffee substitute."
Some stories of honor and bravery.
An American who recognizes his own drive for the game and says about the war: "one feels that, despite everything, that is what it was for men to sit in Lehnstuhl to do with the evening tide or bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky, and so is such a façade of civilisation and there would be no barbarism behind its own strengthened and literate breast shirt."
Conversely, a British soldier acknowledges that he will probably die and nobody notice or care.
"If you would like the idea of self-sacrifice, we think that this is happening in front of a crowd," he writes.
Instead, it is terrible how "a convicted man was hanged in secret."
Other observations of the old Europe fall apart, and on new types of terror.
"The conflict has been a growing economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He starts the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the Bestiarium of the young century": "the eloquent and ideologically committed mass murderer in the yardstick of the slaughter, while he sits behind a desk."
People behave in unexpected ways and there are equally frivolous behavior, such as Heroismus.
Englund is discussing the soldiers who actively sought a prostitute infected with a sexually transmitted disease, in order to escape the front.
"The grotesque expression can be discovered in trade with Gonokokken-Eiter, bought for soldiers and their genitals, greased hoping to come to the hospital," he writes.
"Those were really desperate, rieben him in the eye, which meant that they were blind to the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves Englunds poetry is elastic and unintrusive and fits perfectly with its human task.
In dozens of small scenes he unleashed the way, as the war "in a unique way of uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to ask themselves why their leaders for fighting.
The best books about the First World War were distorted, rather like Paul Fussell ' Great War and Modern Memory, " or novels such as Erich Maria Remarques " in the West is nothing new, " as the extensive history books.
Englunds band enters an unconventional glory hall.
His book has the most devastating end, I have read in a factual book.
I admit it.
But it is as if he is with his book this side of the main people weggeschnappt nose and lit with a wave of wood.
After an early misstep, a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wore helmets.
They had decided on the night of Monday to Tuesday, because very few people at this time in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed of all the other thought initially to take part in an exercise.

The events of the last few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the Dezernats and Hausbesetzern a huge increase in public sympathy, were not allowed to repeat itself.

The final training unit Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order, in the park, "at the last minute," said someone familiar with the order, which is a declaration as an "exercise."
"The few police officers who were involved to my knowledge, not knowing that it was about the Zuccotti Park, for example," said someone who wish to remain anonymous.
"The only people who knew that the Zuccotti Park, for example, were high-ranking officials of the portfolio."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned the city.
Officials wanted to remove the park on 14 October, then off but, as a protest, hundreds of learning came together after they had learned from these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the operation Tuesday, including SWAT from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials, normally used in high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said that in the course of the day, many people in the park and, almost like commuters, 1.00 a.m. in the night is a good time.
"It was appropriate to do so if the smallest number of people in the park," he said.
Ambulances with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers blaring prior to the departure of the Pike panties and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages from the loudspeakers blaring roar seemed to intimidate many protesters.
The public officials in their bright blue jackets wind broke into the park, many protesters bled their things together and walked out of the ground.
The police said that until 1: 45.00 p.m., no tents would be tackled in order to give the protest learning time to pack their belongings.
Other teams of officials were seen as they gathered in the vicinity to intervene, arrests should be necessary in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said that this is happening to their own security.
But many journalists say that they wanted to prevent them from seeing the police actions in the park and they said that the handling of the officials was very harsh.
Mr Browne said that television in the Church Street on the west side of the park would make photos.
When the police in the West by the great muddle of personal matters, the protesters, among other things, suitcases, Astroturf and bags with clothes, followed by their city employees cleaning untied, what was left behind.
Some protesters, who refused to go were towed out. Images of already published a short time later on the Internet.
One of the main core of protest was in the vicinity of the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park.
Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp did in her arms.
And two people would chain themselves to trees, Mr Kelly said.
Officials of the civil protection have been launched loszuschneiden.
As Mr Kelly said there have been no arrests in the park until about 3: 30.00 p.m.
The evacuation was completed after 75 minutes, according to the police.
Mr Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests, he said, because of "disorderly conduct and resistance to arrest."
The most prominent officials on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed officials of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, divisional chief of Detectives, was also there.
Despite his presence, "launched" Mr Kelly "operation," as Mr Browne said.
In the event that they should, waited a second group of officials on the eastern side of Broadway between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In the Cortlandt Street, a road block to the north of the park, and further south in the Pine Street, a block, barricades were erected.
It could be seen from these sites from the police, the radius ever around Zuccotti Park, for example, satisfying.
In a place has been observed as a number of civil servants, many of them with protection, people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions of the night in the south of the park.
5 p.m. against jumped to the south of the Pine Street a protesters on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators, the air from the tyres of a police bus.
Raised the amount of a piece of Sperrholz in one place.
The end came a civil servant and protesters to the hospital.
The carers union will lodge a complaint against the city because of layoffs
The union, hundreds of workers last month, have lost their jobs, is planning to sue the city on Wednesday, as the layoffs because of their disproportionate influence on the schools, which teach poor students are not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is probably the last chance of the union local council, 37, in their efforts to undo the redundancies, is still open.
Sechshundert seventy-two school helpers, care coordinators and other staff who had been among the lowest paid employees of the city, and on October 7, in a move that lost their jobs, the union leaders described as a political revenge for that in the past year, the city's access to a health fund, the working groups, had denied the budget gap should be closed.
This accusation has been categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, said Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools in the last month, the redundancies were part of the budget that passed in June.
A town council member shot back and said that the budget would not specify that the school aid will be made redundant.
Officials from the City Council 37 said they have warned the Ministry of Education in a complaint, and it will give a press conference at which the submission of the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan, formally announced on Wednesday.
Mr. Walcott the complaint and the Ministry of Education as a defendant in the city and eight laid-off workers count as plaintiffs, all of which are coloured or Latin American women, like most of the workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of the city, said the city would not be the complaint and therefore could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a draft complaint, the New York Times, the union has lost to the number of redundancies in schools in the poor neighborhoods of the city, focused a complaint for discrimination to support claims that poor schools, more aid workers, because they are chronically underfunded.
It points out that, while there was no redundancies on Staten Island, and only a few redundancies in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 schools in Brown's Ville, Brooklyn, and have lost 46 helpers in the districts of 8 and 9 in the South bronx were made redundant in the district of 23.
With the loss of five of eight school volunteers, who were in the public school, 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the complaint says: "this is not a wealthy few neighborhood parents can organise donations to offset budget cuts."
P.S.: the budget of the 36th southern this year has been cut by 3.26 per cent, and also lost money, the city of their calculation method for the extra funding for any Armenschuleneinschreibung changed.
The union also complained that the heads of the high schools were led by the language in a memo, which approved the dismissal of care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the act, even if "excess" (German: transfer) in the United States usually exchange a teacher from the payroll describes a school in a pool of available workers, who are paid by the central office.
"Sixty six care coordinators were sacked, not transferred," the complaint says.
Mission ended, Congress is ready to agree on Libya
It looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington to communicate about the uprisings in Libya.
What was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and ending the American interference.
On Thursday, the Committee for international relations of the Senate resolution, which commends Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), with Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "courage."
"This resolution is a tribute to the courageous people of Libya, which began with the reconstruction of their country," said Kerry.
"It is a reaffirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer, lawmakers squabbled both parties and the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions on the approval or disapproval of the role of the US military in the Libya mission to NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain approved a resolution to the limited use of military force by the United States in Libya.
The law was thrown out by a broad fringe of both parties in the Senate, and there was no vote.
But fell on the same day, this bill in the Senate by also outvoted the chamber of a decision to cut funds for American operations in Libya.
The US mission ran into a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress, which was upset enough to criticize Obama's approach in the framework of the mission, but not angry enough to definitively the rug from under our feet.
Then the indecisiveness of Congress overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell in August among the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate is perhaps ready for action.
The resolution of the committee for international relations, "congratulates the people of Libya to their enormous courage and extraordinary stamina in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the US military and its coalition partners, the support of the military operations to protect the people of Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States to a successful and irrevocable Libya's transition to democracy."
The new measures will receive the full support of the body for foreign relations or they will divide the legislators, as it has done the law in June?
The latest version of resistance on the part of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana polis), the committee's top Republican.
Lugars spokesman said on Monday that the final version of the new law have not yet seen.
According to the Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment, which calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional term, Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures, under the leadership of the Republican Bob Good bar (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or any other area at the time to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have tried, unsuccessfully, to bring their amendments to the vote, although they often enough.
Lattes good change is just one of 68 constitutional changes, which were presented to the congress and include a whole range of issues.
Some are double - the same law was submitted to the Congress and the Senate - others differ only slightly.
There are at least 15 versions in the Senate, the compensatory budget amendment and another dozen "controlling federal spending."
Some of the laws are identical, but they give their customers - especially starters with the Republicans, who want to burnish their CV - the opportunity to boast that they have such a measure '. "
The Haushaltskontrollgesetz, which was adopted in August, requires that both the Senate and Congress to vote on an amendment to the budget is balanced.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution, which supports the idea of such an amendment.
The budget also want to lift some members, the number of the provisions, the members of Congress can present limit, while the Republicans José E. Serrano (New York), the limit of two terms of office of the president.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes which, among other things, the right to a good education and health care.
An amendment, which prohibits marriage among sex, as well as an amendment, which prohibits the burning of flags, a recurrent presentation.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the lifting of federal laws, if two-thirds of the states they reject.
So keen to propose changes to the members, so unequal to move faster, as in the past few years.
In 111. Congress showed 77 legislators vor. such changes in the 110 Congress 66th.
The pace pales in comparison to the early 1990s, in which more than 150 amendments members regularly proposed every two years, the figures, which the Senate library.
But they were not much more successful than today's.
The last change, which is to add - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually already proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Hit, but not defeated," Giffords in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man from distance during an election rally in Tucson had fired on them to return, the Republicans Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) Monday evening on national television, she sang the sole Broadway piece, "the Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover is greater than in Congress.
They, along with Diane Sawyer in the ABC News "20/20," they struggled for words and needed assistance walking.
The program showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage of the bullet, which shared its skull, drilling through the left side of her brain and her head from start to finish, crossing has caused.
Three months ago, she returned surprising in Congress, triumphantly in order to give their vote to reduce debt.
In her first television interview after the attack in January in which six people were killed and 13 injured, smiling Gifford, laughed and sang - and described their recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford replied (41): "good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" Specials, the couple recorded shortly before the publication of the new book: "Gabby: a story about courage and hope."
The Special followed Giffords recovery since the attack on 8 January.
In videos, Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you can see them in the hospital bed with kahl shaved head and a long scarf on their foreheads.
They can raise only one or two fingers when her husband encouraged.
Months later, sitting Giffords in a wheelchair, while therapists show, she says simple movements.
A nod to the head.
A sugar with the lips.
And then their first words: "what."
After a few days, Giffords whispering another word: "toast." They would like to see changed their breakfast.
Videos taken in the ABC show, show that music played an important role in Giffords ' recovery: you see the members of Congress, along with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers ' Girls Just Wanna Have Fun " and Tom Pettys " free Fallin ' " sings.
In the interview with Sawyer said Giffords daily spends two hours with therapy that they do not remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that he had Giffords on 12 March, an article in a newspaper about the attack, when they canceled it and asked for the first time after the six people killed during the attack.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and forced medical treatment while awaiting trial.
"Many people have died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Tough, tough, tough."
In the course of the recovery, his wife, Kelly told Sawyer, she said: "I was hit."
"I would say: ' Gabby, you have got to be not beaten? '," said Kelly.
You have got to be taken.
And you will get through this, and you will recover and you will get more than ever before.
Troops feel more sympathy than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala, the millions of dollars for homeless veterans collected in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a Ballade about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A key word collected themselves hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines around him.
The crowd in black Smokings stood up and applauded.
"The servicemen and women were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraising effort in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, among other things, the chief of staff and former chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, the role of the troops.
"They were introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I am sure the organizers have meant well.
I know that.
But there was no respect, not really, it was pity.
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the serious relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops will be showered with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, service members.
The public is increasingly than do people in uniform suffering.
"We were not victims," said Brigadier general Sean B. MacFarland, who commands the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But, apparently, is the only way of support is in the role of the unfortunate souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders, who do not want ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They have also realised that the anger, the returning troops over the last few years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result there are discussions about compassion in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned with the marines from battles, warned Colonel rancorous Mark Cancian, they could see that people outside the military world services from two different perspectives.
Some of them would look with a feeling of awe, as they defeated rebels and travelled to exotic places.
Others would wonder whether an "angry, violent veteran beneath the surface lies," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and highlighted government posts in Washington has taken on his return.
During his job search, he said, he sensed that some of the interviewers they subtly, whether he is capable of immediately after his return from the struggle to withstand the pressure of a challenging post in Washington.
"If you are talking about your service, you must keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian said his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is rooted in the lack of interest by the Americans in the war.
Services will be on the battlefield by a country that has little experience with the military and provides little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, rarely as praise.
"We as a nation, not military heroism, as it was in the Second World War was absolutely normal," said Lieutenant General David Barno rancorous, command of US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public largely on the suffering of a family service.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends who have lost them, or for the severity of their injuries.
The military is under growing pressure to in rape
This week, an important hearing decides whether 28 men and women because of non-intervention in a rape to be charged before the military court.
It should not have hundreds of plaintiffs for the next hearing.
Who Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week than at night by a fellow soldier was raped.
It was back in October 2008 and returned to their barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when they met at a male colleague 12er Pack beer in.
He asked whether he is likely to have a drink in her room.
"My alarm went," Lyman said.
But the Texanerin dismissed their concerns.
I thought: ' Oh, he is 19.
He is from Texas, " she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut feelings."
A few minutes after they had gone to Lymans Zimmer, the man behind it, put it down and raped, she said.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman waiting and 27 other current and former military employees have a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, which will be decided whether a lawsuit against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be allowed in court.
The complaint alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld are not against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional right of the soldiers.
In February, Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., included the complaint initially 17 plaintiffs, but the increases in the following months, 28: 25 women and three men, who all claim that they were raped by soldiers colleagues or sexually abused, and that the military failed to identify, to condemn or an appropriate jurisdiction after the alleged attacks to provide.
Burke says it is monitoring the top military leadership, because the problem is where to begin.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation of the leadership."
Burke also says that she has been in contact since February, almost 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future claims.
Their strategy: instead of all claimants were laying their eggs in one basket, they will, if necessary, submit many more complaints in order to keep up the pressure.
The team of defending for the Defense Ministry, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has made a request for legal action.
The files of the court, Newsweek, lead the defense strategy, first and foremost, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for violations in the armed forces.
Because of a law to the Supreme Court from 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is liable for violations that soldiers are currently on active service.
"The alleged damage caused during the military service of the plaintiffs," the document says.
The Ministry of Defence refused any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are not permitted to the service in the fight, it is the only distinction in the name: modern wars have seldom clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers increasingly important roles, particularly in the conditional contact with indigenous women in war zones.
The result: died 150 female soldiers, two-thirds of them in clashes between the two wars.
It is time that the military will be modernised, Burke says.
And she is not alone in their fight: three other complaints, except their are pending.
At Yale Law School, the veteran ' Legal Services Clinic a complaint against the four main military academies because of alleged promotion of a misogynistic atmosphere.
This independent, the non-profit Vietnam veteran of America, a complaint against the military in the diagnosis of "personality disorder" to dismiss the rape victims received them from the service - a normal procedure, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Their group was in December, a complaint against the veteran administration, management of the war veterans), in which she accused her discriminatory practices in its dealings with entitlements for people who claimed to be sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws has been presented separately by a mixture of senators and representatives from both parties in Congress, which offer a number of leads.
In 2010, according to the sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, Office for prevention and reporting sexual abuse) of the Ministry of Defence 3158 sexual abuses.
But most of the abuses are not registered at all, and after its own estimate of the Pentagon's account of the number of approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19000 cases, per year.
The report, which was published in March, also examined the rates of law enforcement: 2010 came 20 per cent of registered cases in the military court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in the case of Burke's describe their attacks as only the first of a series of trauma.
In the case of Lymans reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
On this night, she says she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a whole series of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a Vergewaltigungsset and the blood of their aggressor, which came from a section of his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge during the hearing she was asked after the sex they had before the attack with her boyfriend.
Six people said that as a character witness on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, which was ultimately acquitted.
"I still remember the day when the verdict was read out," says Lyman.
"I thought I would go into labor, I ran screaming from the courtroom."
"They brought me in the psychiatric ward and I remember when I came back, my commander said: this was not his procedure, which was my procedures."
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist who ultimately diagnosed a personality disorder and unable to service.
It has been disgracefully redundant, so that they have no support in January 2010.
Whether the complaint submitted Lyman and the other plaintiff, is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at the George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "I think they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticised for the first time, it called into question.
I am living a critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is lagging behind a decade because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence, the liability.
He adds: "the odds are against them... but it is important for them to try."
These things will only change if good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing is not their way, Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, with hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard, until it comes to reform," she says.
Or until we die, which always comes first.
Walls have eyes: how researchers watching you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe was Anders Behring Breivik, only one of many boys, their anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, had Breivik has confessed to a killing spree in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, its first public hearing before the court.
Although Breivik acted alone, it is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent much time until his attack before his computer, and with some of the millions of gechattet nationalists, the extreme right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, wanted more researchers to find out about these people.
But, as we find them?
It is easy - you only have to connect to Facebook.
"We have noticed that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British ideas factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Face Books hide personal data is enzyklopädisch, Bartlett says that the researchers simply use the advertising tool alongside their desired demographic data to determine exactly with scientific precision, as do retailers for years.
Bartletts team held a half-million fans of extreme-right groups in Europe and reshaped it with Adds to connect, but instead with a new band or a new diet product, Adds invited users to a poll in which their education, their attitude towards violence and was asked to assess their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10000 followers of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - that they just have to leave their office.
"It is a fairly new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly come as a surprise, online promoter of extreme-right groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration.
But in a kind of distortion, surprisingly, are those who combine their online activism with offline activism more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens. "
DEMOs work is just one example of how Facebook will become a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the side in order to study everything from health issues to social trends, such as ' Likes ' text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, on average, add three content per day, Face Books generates data supernova explosion, " a research boom, the number of scientific work by the name of this side in the title of almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook, the fact that you can study this side of people not normally with his Clipboard on the street.
"If you previously tried to interview people in the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to first inform the party and they would never have access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook is everything away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the side offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who drink their full binge on Facebook, significantly more problem than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno proposes that equal students, for example, residential advisers to monitor and help a student if they have too many post status updates.
"They can't solve a problem if you have not recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-writer and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who otherwise would not have been found."
Facebook also zapft the data to his own people.
The data team has compiled statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the mid-term elections in 2010 and a national happiness index (primarily used data on the only Facebook access - master of digital freedom have long known that the side of their great data treasure trove for other research purposes.) 
But the Facebook users know that the side they watched, whether or not they now want to be able to play with a friend, thousands of miles away, Scrabble sown, allows for the side's own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook will be part of a survey that they do not even know something?
While researchers have strict guidelines laid down their offline data collection is online.
"I do not believe that many users have thought about the fact that researchers could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge lab, a study in 2006, in which he studied the public side of students on Facebook.
"What they are concerned, it was all about them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
It is impossible to know how many of the information in a user profile, and contributions are true on Facebook.
"What we say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook, are two entirely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, Selwyn thinks despite his years as a technology researchers that Clipboard and a pencil are still the best research tool, anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for the real world and to speak with real people," he says.
"Social research must look at the social - and a lot of social life is still offline."
"Cold and inhuman": unlike Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Unlike Behring Breivik, the man who runs two amok, which this summer in Norway, 77 people were killed, has described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" to fight.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a knight temple of Norway," he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court, because you have received your mandate of organizations supporting the hate ideologies and multiculturalism."
"I recognise the laws, but I plead not guilty."
Judges canceled Torkjel Nesheim Breivik during this monologue, because he wanted to give "Breivik, not the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to cohere Breivik, a pre-written speech permits at the end of the hearing to go to the families of his victims.
Nesheim also ordered that the police Breivik for another 12 weeks in custody, it will be four weeks, with no access to the media, he said that the authorities all visits and all correspondence about eight weeks.
Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some were hoping to see Breivik's eyes, others wanted to confirm that he remains behind bars.
All were with the goal, that Wegschließen.
"I thought he was cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it is a bit further, after I have seen and heard suspects."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and acted calmly and professionally throughout the hearing, and he looked journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered the building and left.
Despite Breiviks bizarre reference, he would be part of a larger "resistance" move, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
There may be some that the attacks on 22 July, apparently, was the work of an individual extremists and not a group of radicals.
But this will make it easier to automatically senses the heartache and the confusion of a whole nation still?
"I wish he would look like a monster, but it does not," said the relatives of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons of interviews with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown this week in a theatre
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, compared to some with Henry Ford and stressed the technology genius as a great modern inventors.
What Apple fans, but perhaps most revealing in the recently discovered Jobs interview, which this week dusted off special film displays on the major markets, is to understand how this creative head of business processes and procedures.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-styled Hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer eager to tinker diagram - a man who believed that many business leaders, " a disease of thought, " a really great idea accounts for 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product. "
In 1995, developed Bob Cringely led the TV series " triumph of the specialist idiots ' on the departure of the personal computer, and he sat for more than an hour with Jobs, in a rare, detailed talks.
At this point in time were relegated 10 years have passed since Jobs from Apple was, and he worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was on the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringleys interview was used in specialist idiots, he says that the Kopiervorlagen of interviews in the delivery.
After Jobs death discovered a full VHS-copy in the garage of the director.
This slightly edited footage forms the basis for the 68minütigen film "Steve Jobs: the lost interview" this Wednesday and Thursday in the country, Mark theatre.
For someone who is well known that he loathes detailed interviews, seems jobs surprisingly eager to explain its technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly pensive.
In the course of the interviews, it is four times longer breaks between the question and answer - Nachs 10-15 seconds, in which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and accuracy.
There are moments in which Jobs ' impact on days when he appears impatient to Cringelys issues and anschubst faster on issues or actions of greater significance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone that seems somehow incredibly far-sighted Verlorene interview if Jobs assesses what other companies in his opinion, right or wrong, and his own vision for the future of the computer.
It is one thing to see posthumous eulogies career jobs to read, but jobs here as the greedy dreamer, is poised to grandeur, is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had it all, he drew and made it.
A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of Verlorenen interviews:
As he learned to run a business:
" During the years in the business, I ask: " why you do things? ' and the answer, you always get is, ' Oh, it is so easy. "
No one knows why he does what he is doing, no one thinks the business really carefully about things.
I have noticed that.
Jobs will lead to further his efforts to streamline the accounting at Apple.
Amazed costs were recorded - usually began with "standard costs" were estimated at a mere innocence and then adapted "deviation" - he developed an automated factory, which will be able to ensure that the business costs in minute.
The Pope was veralbert:
Jobs told of "the Blue Box," which he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which to creep into the telephone company and free long-distance calls.
The device has already been written, but jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of Selbstbemächtigung is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a chargeable phone, make a phone call and then by an AT & T network in another link, while so many satellites as possible by stacking.
"We sent matters of half a dozen times around the globe, and if we grölte phone, there was a minute later, next door in the phone," jobs told kichernd.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something that trillions of dollars of infrastructure can control throughout the world."
Both of us, we did not know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can monitor a gigantic thing, it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that it would be without Apple.
Jobs told from a glorious coup, Wozniak and he almost pulled out when they anriefen via Blue Box in the Vatican in the middle of the night and wanted to speak with the pope, while it so well, they were able to follow Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night were called in to speak with the American diplomats, the two loslachen before the Pope even came to the telephone.
As he is in love with the technology (and unprepared, Bill Hewlett anrief):
In the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a spectrum meters, he was looking for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute telephone call received jobs for the summer work part-time at Hewlett-Packard.
"It was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company that I had seen in age, and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated his staff."
Later jobs, one of the HP workers visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first Desktop computers ever produced."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunscher tube and I love in him.
I would climb at HP as a teenager and depend on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview speaks jobs about spontaneously inventing new products.
Early in his career when he incorporated some platinum, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of 30 days and had to think both the assembly processes as well as the extradition of the ready-made equipment.
He later Apple recalls the problems he had in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember resounding arguments... you shouted at me, that it would take five years to build a mouse, which would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse, we are building for $15, and this was incredibly credible.
Large companies keep:
Long before he left Apple, Jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial giants in stumble with their visions and lost control of their shares.
"We say that you are working with IBM or Xerox, so you make a better photocopier or printer, so what?"
They have the monopoly shares, so the company is not successful.
Sales and marketing to make it successful, so [people], which is ultimately the company and the product, the people will be pushed out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly by people who have no concept of extinct about good products versus bad products - crafts art.
It happened at Xerox...
Xerox would have the entire computer industry.
It would be ten times greater, the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They have caught the defeat from victory.
On innovation, as the art form:
"It is a lot of craft art between a great idea and a great product... if we develop this great idea, it is changing and growing."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
Votes must be certain things that you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
We must see 5000 cases, these concepts, and they all bring together...
Ultimately, it comes down to taste, what you do, it is that you try with the best stuff that people have created, and then trying these things to bring together.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shamelessly in stealing grand ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, Zoologen were historians, who just happens to be the best computer scientists in the world.
It would not have been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dinieren with opponents of health laws, court accepts case
On the day of the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically share issue of whether a challenge to listen to the health care legislation, President Obama will gesponsort, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, at a dinner attended by the law firm that represented the case before the court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to a meeting to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases dealt with a complaint, the 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care have decided last year by Congress, a law with conservative activists in the United States has become the buzzword.
The judges agreed with the hearing; in fact, it is expected in March, a 5 1/2-hour foundations discussion, presumably the result will probably be the presidential campaign in 2012, at the time the court decision will be in full swing.
The lawyer will stand trial and argue that to overturn the law, will probably be Paul Clement, Prosecutor General, under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clements firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Föderalistischen society, a veteran group of defending conservative principles of law.
Another company, which has sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law.
Another was a sponsor of the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., the financially involved in the outcome of the process is enormous.
The dinner was held a few hours after the court had advised on the case, in a Washington hotel.
Service was among other things, Mitch McConnell, the head of the group of Republicans in the Senate and a fierce opponent of the health-care reform
The guests Dinners? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges visit for years events Föderalistischen society.
And that is not contrary to moral rules.
In fact, judges freed from the code of conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal courts.
They would probably fall under the principle 4c of the code, which states: "a judge can take part in fundraising events legislation soon and other organizations, with the judge, not a spokesperson, the guest of honor or according to programme a host of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme closeness of Scalia and Thomas to two with the fall-related firms and companies with a massive financial interest in this, morality and to alert government activists.
"The startling break with morality and contrary to the code belies the complaints of some judges lie, the court, the same rules apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the common cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending proceedings on the court."
Their appearance and their support of a fundraising effort to undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable for this event.
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say that they would court to issue with groups from the agenda, as, for example, the mix Föderalistischen society.
And Thomas ' wife, Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
The Conservatives claim that it was Judge Elena Kagan, who have a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was general prosecutor under the Obama administration, when the first legal challenges in the first instance in court.
Their critics Kagan pushed itself to withdraw from the hearing of the case because of bias, because it is too much in the defence of the law, in order to be impartial.
Kagan is not about to do so.
Boeing draws record orders of $18 trillion in country
Airline Emirates ordered 50 two-track aircraft from the Boeing 777, with an option on a further 20 aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $1 trillion.
It is really a rare news that a company commissioned more than 50 of its products.
But it is a big business, if the company's aircraft manufacturers Boeing Co. and the price lists for these 50 aircraft in a record amount of $18 trillion.
The contractor is equally unusual by Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast that was published on Monday, valuing the Chicago company that airlines from the Middle East 2520 aircraft over the next 20 years, with a value of $450 trillion.
Boeing announced at the weekend, its biggest contract ever for commercial aircraft, as measured by the value of the order: 50 two popular Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer was commissioned by the airline Emirates Dubai.
The airline has also announced Boeing at the Dubai 2011 aviation show, an option to buy 20 more planes, the entire price lists at $26 trillion.
On Monday, then ordered, according to Boeing, Oman Air six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, fuel consumption and vastly improved passenger comfort.
The price lists for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"It is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Internal Dihora, stock market expert from Morningstar.
"The quality of this particular customer is very high."
Many airlines of the Middle East are in possession of the oil-producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the aircraft is a rise in oil prices, which typically is damaging to the airlines, because this is one of their biggest cost items, not so harmful, because the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because it is less than other airlines tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"They have a natural hedge," he said.
The appointment of Emirates confirmed Boeing's leading position in the market for aircraft and helps the Airbus SAS competitors in the dominant position with the A350.
Boeing's victory on the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the introduction of the largest A350, which directly competes with the 777-300ER.
It postponed the introduction, in order to gain more confidence after the customers demanded a higher interest burden and scope.
Boeing shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican president apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claimed that drug traffickers opponents Fausto Vallejo of the PRI have supported in the race for the governorships.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon has apparently lost their bid for the office of the governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections she claimed on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results won Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, the race for the governorships in the western state.
"The intervention of the organised crime during the entire electoral processes and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidate, our staff in the polls... you have built up polling booths occupied road blockades and instructed people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico, until the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
The PRI is hoping for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo Claderon seems barely to have led in the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN her brother refused to recognise Vallejo as victors.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, the PRD, which is currently acting governor, came to three, a heavy defeat for the divided and hapless left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital city of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers and the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels, which specialises in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and Michoacan has chosen to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence still continues.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election, during an election rally for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have dropped out of fear for the local elections.
The PRI strengthens a victory party, no matter how vicious the elections in Michoacan.
The man, the PRI in the presidential race is likely to be represented, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated the Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think that this victory courageously look into the next year."
ADB urges Asia to aid in the rescue of the euro zone
The Asian Development Bank (Asian Development Bank ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the euro zone in its debt crisis, in order to prevent a long-term downward trend, slowing the growth of the economy in Asia.
Rajat Nag, administrative director of the ADB headquarters in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world " must do everything in your power to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc, either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), "dispassionately" look at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leadership and European resources through Asia to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We are all in the same boat."
"So everyone is helpful, Europe can help from this crisis," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain extent, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe's monetary union came in the last few months in a severe debt crisis.
In the last few days, Italy rose dangerously interest costs, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The heavy debt crisis in Europe is fuelling fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls to support the leading emerging countries should join the euro zone.
Mr Nag said that any support of Asia will be channelled through the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds, the EU's rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - the European partners in Asia, greater bargaining power.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the euro zone, because the economy is now among the declining exports and drying up foreign capital flows.
"Nobody wants to see that the euro zone remains unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing huge challenges and we need to maintain a high growth level."
"It is not an option, it is a mandate, because where else we find work for millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no reason to help the rich Europeans, when they are facing great economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at the US Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India, aid for Europe, of which more than 800 million of the $2 or less a day.
"Eventually, they will find that the Greeks with 50 to retire and holidays to spend on the beach, and then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, executive director of the World Economic Forum, similar asked why India's reserves should be used to keep in Greece the numerous and well-paid employees in the public sector, with jobs in poorly led losses bring institutions such as the railways.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the eurozone "significant knock-on effects" on the whole of Asia.
The ADB forecast, with economic growth at 7.5 per cent in Asia for the years 2011/now threatens "the risk of gradation" because of the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets should produce "contingency plans" in order to protect themselves in a downward trend and a significant capital outflow of their word.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in the defence sector
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta inflamed Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would go unnoticed to weaken national security, so he set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the chessboards in Afghanistan and civilian conveyor belts.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts to the tune of $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts 600 trillion dollars or more will be needed if Congress can reach any conclusion in the spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of Congress in reaching a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called confiscation would lead to 23% overall cuts, as well as a halt to many new projects.
"Such a large cut, carried out in such a glib way would be impractical to make the most of our shipping and construction projects - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would be forced to separate us involuntarily from a large part of our civilian staff and, since the reduction would be implemented quickly, we would have to furlough almost certainly civilians, in order to achieve this objective."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alert."
The cuts were in the end, the combat troops, " said Panetta.
"During the war time contingents in the fight against terror are not directly affected by the seizure would adversely affect the serious intrusion into the basic budget war efforts," Panetta warned.
"Recruitment have been cut, which would lead to delays in the recruitment and hiring supervision, supporting the war."
"The salaries of the staff would be reduced, which leads to late payments to war-time traffickers and the legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Ministry of Defence would be a rapid decline in the United States as the leading military power in the world."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when she published Panettas letter.
"This is a result that we can live with, and it is certainly not that we should impose."
"The seizure is a threat to national security interests of the United Statten and their commitment should not be allowed."
Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of senators to increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget will strengthen or demands will exclude the Pentagon cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has become increasingly outspoken, the possible cuts, although he has many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House, before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he faces tough choices.
At a press conference in last week's painting of the defence minister, a gloomy picture, which could face a military shell, but without the heart.
"It is a ship without sailors."
"It is a brigade without ammunition."
"It is an Air Force squadrons without sufficient trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who are able to fulfil the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
"It is a dispute, there is a lack of morality and alert, and is not in a position to take it up with potential opponents."
"They are really angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta introduced new details of how reductions "creates significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global deployment and response capacity, which leads to an unacceptable risk of future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the deletion of the largest defense projects could fall victim, including those who have already been tested and are already in the early stage of planning.
This list also includes the fighter pilots F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new aircraft bombs, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new oral Litt Combat Ship and the new ground vehicle, the Army and Navy needed to replace the Humvee.
We would stop the further development and testing of the F35, it would in the next 10 years to save up to 80 billion dollars, but supporters say that it is an important next step in the buildup, so that the possible dangers averted by China and other opponents.
How to mutter a lie
A glance at the current headlines shows how serious and widespread deception and lying in their daily lives.
The Republican presidential nominee, Herman Cain, is preoccupied with the allegations of sexual harassment on the part of several women to deal with both sides accusing each other of lying.
The leadership of Penh State is accused of My sworn as supposedly reports, a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
In the past week has been mitangehört on an open microphone, the French President Nicolas Sarkozy, the American president to Barack Obama claimed the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York congressman and Internetexhibitionist Anthony Weidner made fools when he brought renunciations in circulation in the very quickly refuted by incontrovertible proof.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violations in the campaign financing in connection with the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one can forget that it has seen the media circus, President Bill Clinton has triggered when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office.
Stories about fudges in school and college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers their students test answers, so that they themselves well in their performance reviews.
Mentors, who teach the opposite should send a message that lies and fudges OK.
We are seeing how much deception?
Studies show that we are lying every day between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies, but as Notlügen.
Another study shows that strangers lying to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To detect lies, or "lies to uncover" to learn is important for every human being, and both for personal or professional reasons.
Far from a parlor game crowd Aden, for example, in which the goal is to create "property you!" Is the Enttarnen deceiving a serious knowledge, based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities, led by the far-reaching research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
As a result of research is that most of the old myths about the lies were exposed.
Look lies in the eye.
They stammeln falters, reddening and zappeln not always.
This, however, it is not close to identify and treat these liars.
A levelled Lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth, something about the structure of the assertion that the subtle facial expressions on issue and timing.
I have spent several years in order to examine the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing area of the Enttarnung, and it is clear that the Enttarnen a deception is a modern ability, it is easy to learn and helps us in their wrists in our complex world, especially if the suspensions or the questioning of people or negotiations or management are among the professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at assessing other people to raise their interest and to manage their own emotions and they intuitively sense how it is perceived by others.
Thanks to the research, we know that extrovertierte people lying more than introverted people, that men are more self-oriented " lies presented as women whose lies more ' other ' - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people reneging on their partners less often than unmarried people, but the lies they tell are mostly " greasy lies ").
We also know that if a person has been exposed as a culprit, others feel less guilty, had lied to this person.
As we see whether someone is lying?
First, you observe the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "streamlining Base," the starting position.
It is a point of reference for the subsequent assessment of changes.
You are watching the attitude of the laughter, the voting quality of their experimental person.
They should know better, when someone usually are constantly with the foot, so that they are wrong to blame if it during meetings with the foot.
Then you look at striking accumulations of verbal and nonverbaler behaviour.
You see these accumulations as alarm, the strident, not as proof of a Enttarnung.
People who hide congealing, perhaps, if they try to recall their history, and perhaps their feet pointing in the direction of the door, or they are in the direction of the outcome, to change their position in a significant way, or show a " relaxation after the recruitment conversation, this deep, relax Ausatmen and the change in the attitude, if all the hard questions are over.
The questions are often mistakenly signal that a recruitment conversation is over, just after the recruitment conversation to look after this detente.
You are also on the language of your experiments.
The slip-up by Scott Peterson is famous, he used the past tense, as he claimed his killed wife is still living and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive individuals can also use a distance: "I have not had a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky," or if there is a vexed question repeated in its entirety.
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" if it is a vexed question: ..." in order to tell you the truth... as far as I know... in good faith."
The answer is more likely to perceive perplexed as objectively, which is often the alarm bells.
There is no magic remedy for Enttarnen lies, but you can learn skills, thanks to a Enttarnung is possible.
Thanks to these skills can be rare victims of fraudsters, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan for a pipeline will be reviewed after exposure to delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada into the Gulf of Mexico, which angered the unions and calmed environmentalists, is trying to build the pipeline companies to plan the project, so that we can go back to normal.
Trans-Canada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of Sand Hills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building by Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax trans-Canada, said that the company was still confident that the pipeline will ultimately be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision regarding a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new course is to avoid the area of sand Hills in Nebraska and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a vast underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska to Fox News.
The new environmental review, which the State Department has ordered a decision may be postponed until 2013, after the elections in the coming year, although officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
The 1700-mile pipeline to Canada was to combine with the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
The pipeline would pass through six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them, because they appreciate the fact that the pipeline will create 20000 jobs.
But the legislators Nebraskas, who are opposed to the plan, weighing the laws in order to force a retreat from the region of the sand Hills and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Foreign Ministry has found out that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the principal investigator of the ministry has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist, was stopped by trans-Canada, Paul Elliott, the 2008 adviser was Hillary Clinton, is mired in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company was ordered to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice since they trans-Canada.
Charged with Patti LaBelle, since they allegedly forced a toddler from fear to erbrechen
A New York family claims that the disco-has-been Patti LaBelle in the lobby of its Manhattan building, a Tobsuchtanfall, their small daughter in fear that they fear.
The tirade of "lady Marmalade" singer, the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk suffers such fear that "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on 10 November last year, when the stagehands Kevin Monk, his wife, Anna Rose, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to leave a family outing.
While Kevin Monk lifted the car, Anna Rose Monk with baggage and Genevieve on the arm in the lobby in her building on Side River Boulevard.
Anna Rose Monk said that she had stopped near the door and removed her daughter for a moment.
" Someone appeared behind me and said: " you know what your daughter is doing? ' and I said ' yes ', and in order to take them back on the arm, " she said.
LaBelle exhorting the pregnant woman angry.
" She said in an aggressive tone: " you should sell your daughter in the vicinity of the door, " said Anna Rose Monk.
" I said to her: " I am not interested in what you say or think. "
She was angry and began to shout, they used the F-word and the A-word, and it was very loud...
She had a bottle of water in the hand and began to dump water out of the bottle.
She said Genevieve would become hysterical.
" I said to this woman: " you see what you have done with my daughter, " said the mother of the child.
LaBelle crashed on the mother, who still Genevieve contributed to the arm and had to be withdrawn from their company and to a waiting car, said Anna Rose Monk.
The baby screamed so much that it had to, she said.
Later, the family asked LaBelle in writing an apology, but received no reply.
LaBelles lawyer and representatives did not respond to phone calls in which was asked for an opinion.
The complaint is a not certain damages, but the lawyer for the family, Sam Davis, said that he will be no fee into account and the family wants the money they get, the Kinderkrebshilfe donate.
"We want to see Patti LaBelle to assume responsibility for their behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially if it is a kindergarten teacher towards an 18-month-old baby in the arm."
Climatic adversity blocking the economy
In the first year, in which Mario López Valdez is in the government, rose in Sinaloa, unemployment and undeclared work, while the foreign investment and the economy stagnated.
In 2011, will remain in the economic history of the Sinaloas in memory, and it is the first year, Mario López Valdez, who described himself as the initiator of change and fueled great hopes on the economic growth, the government is, however, as a result of the climatic odds of growth is not deteriorating, but on the contrary, the most important economic indicators.
The low temperatures in February caused not only losses in millions of dollars in agriculture, but also stuck to the growth of the state economy close borders and caused in the first quarter of the year with a general decline in economic activity by 3.6% This is mainly on the historic reduction of agricultural development 31.16 percent, slowing to other sectors of the economy.
According to the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo were Rural Sustentable. Mexican Council for sustainable agricultural development) report on the impact of the Frosts were 582000 hectare of land damaged, 78.03 per cent complete, and the remaining 21.07% partially destroyed were affected mainly the cultivation of vegetables, maize and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity until November has increased steadily in the Mexican state unemployment; the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed in the first quarter of the year, a rapid rise in unemployment, from January to March 55053 inhabitants had no Sinaloas employment, which rose 4.53 per cent of the working population in the second quarter, the unemployment rate to 5.28% from July to September to 6.19 percent, 74000 unemployed in Sinaloa. The 18969 persons are more than in the first quarter of the year.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year to several factors: the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the School of Economic and Social Sciences University Autónoma (UAS), commented on the policy of public institutions indirectly declare the growing unemployment.
"What we are witnessing is a rise in unemployment, which was adopted with several factors that has to do partly with cash losses in the market as a result of the cuts through legislation to combat money laundering in Congress, because those who illicitly accumulate dollars to invest, it is not easy for them to work, or to use for anything else," he said.
Stopped migration
López Cervantes has pointed out that the increase in unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people is the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, left, and this is due to the entry of problems and, on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work, and these people are here to stay and look for work, unemployment," he says.
Undeclared work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, if one takes into account the high proportion of undeclared work incorporates under INEGI 60.38% of the country's employees, who work without paying into the coffers of the social insurance.
Unemployment and moonlighting low wages, the lowest in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican social security) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (governmental authority for labour and social welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa until September 5352 pesos; that is much less than the total state average of 7375 pesos.
Decline in FDI
In addition to the reduction of economic activity and rising unemployment is the sharpest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last ten years, according to Secretaría de Economía (state authority), FDI from January to June 630597 dollars, a loss of 87.74% compared to the 5143 312 dollars in the same period in the previous year in 2011.

The court approved for 2015, the transition to digital television in Mexico
The conversion of the analogue to digital signals in the last few years, the world's most important changes.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaints must be brought forward by the Senate and House against the presidential decree and by virtue of the switch from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to a lack of eight votes needed for legislative challenge.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza was the view of the president, Felipe Calderón, have not exceeded his powers when he described the decree law with the details of the switch to the terrestrial digital television.
This decision was rejected by the Senate launched constitutional dispute, since he received the necessary qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court should decide on the constitutionality or the non-constitutionality; the law remains in force.
In the project for the lawsuit, which was drafted by the Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero, has been proposed to explain the decree law unconstitutional because, for the radio and television concerned the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federale Telecommunications Commission in Mexico) is responsible, which is why the decree law reserved for the hierarchical principles and the law would contradict.
Voted in favor of the project only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies constitutional complaints against the decree law. After the adoption of the complaints, the Minister Sánchez Cordero said the decree law no longer and all activities to create the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the debate on the project, which is also the Minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible.
In his speech, the Prime Minister, not to agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the government of countries with general rules, the measures should take the public administration, should regulate.
"I do not believe that, if we do that, it would impair the independence of the regulator." She also recalled that the strategic planning policy areas, such as the sector of telecommunications, for constitutional reasons, the central state government, since it leads the state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals through digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place in recent years throughout the world, and it leads to a better use of the radio-electric spectrum, increasing the quality of the signal and more channels.
Delaying the switch, she said, was a beneficiary of the digitisation, which have a decision in the public interest, not just the technical aspects, "because they include economic, social, political and technical aspects of security."
These matters, she emphasized, "the action of the whole system, in accordance with the principle of economic management by the state, they included a group of characteristics in the hands of the central state government."
She called that many countries around the world, the digital conversion had already been carried out, and the government, even though they had highly specialised facilities.
We could not conclude that the government, with the publication of the contested law decree to intervene in the powers of Congress, because the laws passed by the legislature would be respected, " she assured.

In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de Los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just adopted last November 9, the election of a series of regulations on the harmonisation of local rules with the reforms of the federal states in election matters.
It is worth remembering that Michoacán neither his political constitution nor his electoral law nor its law on the election of justice had adapted to the reforms adopted by Congress in this round of elections so that they were not entered into force, and the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State Gazette within the deadlines with the argument to have any objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislature, and vice versa, the voice of the state to the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal" because it did not have the right to "decide or veto it."
María de Los Ángeles Llanderal said in an interview about the possibility of individual recount that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Consejo General del IEM the possibility that the local election authority partially or fully counting the ballot papers.
So under the following conditions contained in one or several election packages votes will be counted partial results in the protocols do not agree; the protocol on the counting of votes and berechnung is no files or it is not in possession of the chairman of the electoral commission or there are obvious errors or modifications in the protocols.
Moreover, the total count of fully busy ballot papers if there is a difference between the alleged winners and the second place, which is equal to or less than one percent is provided at the beginning of the session is an explicit request from the Party or coalition chairman, the second of the candidate.
The counting of votes can also be done in their entirety, if after the conclusion of the proper calculation that the difference between the alleged winners and candidates in the second, or less than one percent, provided it is an explicit request from a representative of the party, whose candidate has become the second, in this case, the election packages were exposed to a partial recount were excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia in the same situation, where according to PREP the difference between the first and second place just 0.16%, although the 129 votes not yet counted a total of 923 election protocols.

On Wednesday, the new Italian government
The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy, to present the new government, the crisis of Italy to the brink of economic collapse has resulted in the face.
The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy, to present the new government, the crisis of Italy to the brink of economic collapse has resulted in the face.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that on Sunday appointed Monti would meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, in order to confirm the formation of the government.
It is expected that he will present a majority of technocrats compound cabinet, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would give the president the results of the talks with the political parties to form a government.
"I would like to express my absolute confidence in our country's ability to deal with these difficult times," said the former commissioner of the journalists.
Monti confirmed not explicitly the formation of the government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles are overcome.
"The framework is now well established," he added.
Monti has succeeded in less than three days to form a government, which is a lot less time than normal, while Italy is fighting against a political and financial crisis, which has been the cost of the debt in an intolerable level.
The new, led by former EU Commissioner Monti government needs to adopt a tough austerity package, which was requested by the euro, politicians, the battered confidence in Italy to regain.
The pressure to rush to Monti, reinforced by the volatile market situation, as a result of the Italian government bonds for 10 years, with 7 percent interest, which is where Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue package.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "we said we would support this government, after all."
We believe that this government is the last chance to bring Italy out of this emergency.
The Monti's chances of success have been substantially increased by the support of the party PDL Silvio Berlusconi on Saturday as a result of the crisis had to resign.
"We believe that the efforts of the professor Monti are destined to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is essential, because until now, many of its members against a majority of technocrats government, Monti is just.
Support from Parliament
The new government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support to the implementation of the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Opposition to his efforts, or the delaying of the reforms could lead to a devastating attack by the financial markets.
The Italian Association of foreign banks and his reference, Monti's failure was a disaster, too.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and employers ' associations, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
On Tuesday night, the session is to be completed.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano's response to the crisis, an extremely rapid change of government.
After a sigh of relief at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would have reached critical borders as a result of the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister, the costs for the Italian government bonds.
A bailout of Italy with a public debt of EUR 1.8 trillion, would be too much for the current EU rescue package.
Monti said his government should be held until the next elections, expected in 2013, despite predictions that the politicians are going to give him time to implement the reforms, instead of the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should only technicians, a reference to their concerns about the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources indicate that the mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicates the involvement of people from political life.

"To play in Costa Rica is a dream to fruition"
In the exclusive interview with Viva says Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, the band is prepared to give in the national stadium, one of its best concerts next Sunday.
More than 20 years, they were expected, but the band assured that it is a dream, if they play in Costa Rica.
The Acting Bassist and Mitgründer group, Jeff Ament, Viva last week by Brazil from an exclusive interview.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20 years of existence, and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only freeze in Central America.
On this day, they come from 7.30 p.m. in the national stadium, along with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las rtas wardrobe from Costa Rica.
They read an excerpt from the conversation to find its full transcript in the online edition of La Nación.
For Costa Rica's fans realised a dream if Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: are you aware of what this means for your fans?
To play in Costa Rica is a dream for us.
This is just the second time that we have been in South and Central America, and until now, it is great.
I am only on holiday in Costa Rica. It is a beautiful country, that we still have a few days to stay there.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you, because the fans of the band are completely. They see our utmost attention to the days before the concert.
What you are saying your enthusiastic fans?
Thank you, all these years to stand by our side.
We have almost 21 years until we came to Costa Rica, and I have waited so long and we 're sorry to have taken so long, until we got here.
Some people are of the opinion that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
This is not a little bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we have made in the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.
We have played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that we fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really have the inclination to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are enthusiastic about the jungle for Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How do you know of Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friend is a surfer and I have a great friend who lives in Tamar Enhanced, where the waves are unimaginable.
My friends are always driven surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico are excellent places for surfing in this way, people who love the surfing, we have learned.
You have huge shows with many of the songs offered with an eye on the tour.
You have plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played, we also have no borders.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs, and we want to play a couple of songs from each album and provide a good and versatile repertoire of our fans.
It is never repeated your repertoire.
Why?
I believe this is partly because we play nine plates and more than 120 songs can play everyone likes a different song, so the decision, which we will not be easy.
If we have two or three songs that we no longer have to include in the repertoire, we will be better able to maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they have reasons to remember why these songs like they might otherwise be forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore, for the audience.
With this tour celebrates your 20-year history.
If she looks back, it is difficult for you to believe in your success?
Yes, totally.
First of all, I believe that none of us has to play in a great rock band, and for over 20 years, which is like a dream.
We continue on this blessing, and it is great now to make music.
We may, and are delighted to bring music.
We are lucky to go to the places in the world, we have always wanted to visit again.
Things could not be better.
What it meant for you to have actively participated in the birth of Grunge?
It is always been an honour to be part of this group of large bands.
We are good friends with the people of Sound Guards, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and unusual, if a movement from a group of friends.
And there is a band from a city, but it is unusual, if at the same time, five or ten groups come from the same city.
We are proud and we are honoured to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we are still together.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and Sound Guards on their tour, and we are pleased to be still with all of them friends and we are honoured to be part of this emerged from Seattle-Sounds.
It is also very unusual for a band like the exporters with the same musicians together for a long time.
Yes, four of us play for 21 years and Mattisen (Cameron) met 13 years ago, to us, which is already a lot more time than many bands.
First of all, I believe that we are all happy to still be alive, and also we care for each other.
We are all close friend why musical paths have opened every individual freedom to experiment.
A familiar to the other and music could not be better.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy, on the other hand, it was thanks to your success always do what you wanted.
As she finds a balance?
The way we have grown, it has made it easier to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too often on tour, because it is too easy to this game with huge numbers of people who love your music.
Until you consider that the people who came for the music reminds you that you have the music and what it has not determined to be a famous rock star has in any case never interested.
What you have memories of your other Motherwell Love bone?
I think we have very good songs, and it was great to start.
We were given three years for a band until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) never had a record out.
We were disappointed to have taken so long, and we are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore TD), with the band, a friend, when I hear a song or see photos, I think, what an incredible man Andy was and how he brought laughter, it was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and to talk about music and football, and many other issues.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic bond desk rtas Las are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that she knows her work, in particular, Eddie Vedder, and that is why you have chosen for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us Las videos by various groups and this band liked best, and so we are curious to see what rtas wardrobe can provide live, and this will certainly exciting.
Why does her text of Yellow Ledbetter, if you live?
This is an issue for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he is singing the first thing he can think of.
From whom you have got to be as influenced Bassist?
So many +
Among the first to me, Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could all afternoon on the Bassisten, which I liked.
It has managed to Pearl Jam, to keep the Grunge alive, although it is not a fad?
I think we all feel very connected with the word Grunge.
If I think about it, the band, which I have mentioned, for example, Mudhoney Sound Guards nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time, if they are still important, I think that is great, because it is worthwhile to hear this music and bands like Mudhoney now make better music than ever before.
Initially, their music was dark, it is now more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album which could counteract lightly, but there are also other songs such as The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive.
I came to two tears when I heard how Ed played, they are very dark songs.
I believe that if you are older and something traumatic happened in your life - for example, if you have a family or a friend loses - influenced your artistic creation and your music, and these two songs are clearly for me.
But I also believe that we can make a happy person and still dark music.

Mexico has since November, the chair of the G20, a group consisting of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world, there is an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double orientation with the South American country since January this year.
The government of Uruguay in recent years has tried to speed up the creation of agreement on the exchange of tax information removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and there are countries which have not all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
There is commercial level since 2004, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay, which has contributed to a growing exchange between the two countries.
The schnurrbärtige plumber enters with "Super Mario 3D" country, the third dimension
Super Mario has been fighting for 25 years, worked tirelessly to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never in three dimensions: "Super Mario 3D country," he is fighting for the love of the girls in Stereo technology.
The game was this month on the Ladentheken all over the world, played from the beginning, the properties of the portable console Nintende 3DS, without special glasses, three dimensional can be tailored.
"Mario is the figure who must say how the Stereoskopie works without my glasses," assured Omar Alvarez, who is responsible for the press to Nintendo specialized in Spain during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez said, "Super Mario 3D" was "the first video game from Nintendo, which has been developed," because, until now, been successful articles such as "star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" adaptations of existing titles from the outset of this console.
The spokesman of Nintendo underlined that, although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D" country "affordable" video game, a quick, liquid game.
Alvarez confirmed that " Super Mario 3D " two games in an offer: the first part is easy, " the less geschckten users.
Then the experts on the different levels of the game, which will be increasingly difficult, "a second round."
In addition, the user in real time between an "aggressive D" or only the depth of the action, choose to overcome the obstacles, without the victims of the "optical effects" must always be three dimensional.
This foray Super Marios into three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console since 2005, is no longer the case.
Zwinkert Nintendo fans of the saga, and repeated the recipe for success of the last spending with this video game: the schnurrbärtige plumber must overcome threats peppered platforms in order to liberate the Princess Peach.
However, the players on news the movements of the environment, the guises and enemies - and a "spielbaren" Luigi.
Colom bears witness to the Portillos extradition to the United States
The president of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced Tuesday that he would be the extradition of the former governor, Alfonso Portillo, so that in the United States for conspiracy to money laundering $70 million to answer.
The process ends on the request of the United States to extradite Portillo, so that this can be brought to justice.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed its decision to form on the independence of the judiciary and the government account that a decision of summary court already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that his government had not interfered in court decisions and all extradition requests, of which he was in place.
Besides Portillo be extradited Sergio Ruano Marroquín for murder and serious bodily injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The approach Colom's is an act of government, if all legal and constitutional bodies on the sentencing of the former Staaatspräsidenten (2000, 2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala must be extradited Portillo if his legal situation is resolved in Guatemale and guaranteed his human rights.
Portillo was acquitted for the misappropriation of 120 million Quetzales in the Department of Defense during his time negotiating the extradition, but the minister presented a contradiction and revived the case anew.
Trinijove has 6000 young people at risk of social exclusion helped
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without professional training.
The first 25 years of life, the Trinijove welfare organisation have led to important results: in this quarter-century have been 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion in order to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition to the more than 100 jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary was held yesterday at an event in the former station buildings Fabra i Coats, about 300 people took part.
Trinijove was created in 1986 in the neighbourhoods Trinitat Vella with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, work with drug problems, the risk of the margins were under threat.
At yesterday's ceremony in Sant Andreu many senior facilities and institutions who have worked in those 25 years with the club.
The participation of different political representatives to election campaigns documented the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the president of the Generalitat (parliament of the autonomous region of Catalonia), Artur Ma and his predecessor, Mr Pujol attended the celebrations of the former socialist education minister Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and current left-green councillor Ricard Goma.
The great hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalonian minister for social affairs and family, Josep Lluís Cleries, the Director-General of the Socialists, the savings bank La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Ma stressed that Trinijove was created, and that the current times are less complicated in very difficult times, but he added that the work they have done until now is a good basis. "
For the president of the Generalitat, is Trinijove a model, to fight against difficult circumstances and people in difficulties, there is hope.
"The economic crisis is for the club and the work he is doing nothing new," he said.
Occupied households were held in the giant parties, has been cleared
The homeowners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building to the street Balmes No 51 (Barcelona).
The 12 House occupants left the building yesterday afternoon, without resistance.
All the signs are that the nightmares of the neighbours of the House No 51 found on the street Balmes come to an end.
Twelve people walked out at noon yesterday voluntarily the building, which they had illegally occupied and huge festivals organised the neighborhood had driven to despair, and the evacuation was made on court warrant without without police intervention.
The clearance was replaced Türschloss, in order to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on will be controlled access," confirmed the skeleton.
The House occupants, 11 of the 13 homes had occupied the building - the rest were angemalt inhabited - the entire electric plant and part of the water supply; also, they had the walls and all kinds of waste, especially cans with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower echelons of huge parties were celebrated lasted up to two days, and the tenants to despair.
In addition to the building, a disco, Balmes, 51, also damage.
Under her, Maria Pantinat Europe Press declared that their business has fallen by 80% since the beginning of the house occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the house occupying their unfair competition because they sold the drinks to three euros, while in the EUR 10 disco.
Moreover, the owner of the Freizeitlokals displayed by the neighbours because of disorder, while they said the noise is not derived from the visitors of the disco, but by the Hausbesetzern and, in particular, the guests of the festivities, which were organised and the disgruntled neighbours in the last few weeks, more and longer.
The leaders of the disco declared that the harassment was so great that it came with the owner of the building, no rent to pay for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that they have received in recent weeks, more complaints from neighbors.
The leader of the PP (Popular Party - People's Party) in the mainly councillor, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had demanded last week, the building immediately, and the problems of civil coexistence and downloading of urban community to get a grip.
He said that just before the summer, occupies a floor of the building, but that the House occupants got into all the floors of the building, and almost all homes in the last few months have been in some, it was even burglary.
In this sense, he added, that "it is necessary to put an end to the impunity and anti-social acts in the building."
Yesterday, another building has been cleared by the Catalan police in neighbourhoods Nou Barris.
3: 30.00 p.m., the police approached the street Montral No 35, after she had received a call from a neighbor that had seen four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Parking or mountain?
The architects are apart from the bickering over the fees with the tender.
The urban tender on the 16 gates opened the debate about the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, the peak of the now vanished Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB) published its Schmähschrift this administration on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in the city of Barcelona.
He has even been compared in figures with the Central Park in New York.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park in many people's eyes to the ceiling of Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia is one of the few not spreading in the north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification Collserolas plays as a natural park with this idea.
Served as an example not of Central Park, but Yellow Stone with wild boar in the role of the Yogibärs.
So far, it was the city in September, a tender giant, consisting of 16 competitions for further access doors Collserola.
Undoubtedly a gateway refers to the concept of the parks.
Either that, or somebody has to make gates to the country.
The question is: Collserola, parking or mountain?
The tender is not only from the organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city, the topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a rekurrentes issue at the meeting, two members of the old eingesessenen caste in the elevator.
It is precisely this fact offers a rare agreement between the three architects from Barcelona, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: tender is appropriate.
It is necessary for Roldán ' " after the attack on the coast on the " front on mountains " to discuss the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, who has been on the green apples, not fought.
" It should be based on the principle that the greatest mainly park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is a good thing.
Collserola is more complex, " judging by the architect for the title ' gates of Collserola ' " lexikalische trap ": they must not " as access to a park, but as a containment of areas where action must be taken. "
Modol as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as an "intellectual challenge," the "dangers."
Risks as a result of the " uncertainty, nowadays, the creation of a public space with " after the experience of the 1980s, which had been in the area of the forum, their swan song. "
The first fear is its own limits on what can be developed.
"Limit always means to determine the next step," it says.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [referring to the plan, General Metropolitano (PGM) can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, closer to the issue, simplifies the Collserola side in the direction of Valle sana, " can be understood as a park, not in the direction of Barcelona ', and for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not fall on deaf ears, " though he was the city administration, grateful that his body has been given the opportunity to participate in this project, " from the first moment. "
Moreover, he notes that the Area near the town of escort letter, which allows the architects, to participate in the debate, even though he was giving his " doubt " whether this technical profile, which created multidisciplinary teams (" exactly the right thing, " he says), ' we architects should be a tool. "
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question of complex in the title of the article was tendered in the tender conditions, a global view of Collserola lacks: "there have been 16 contests in the sample," he says, "on the axis of mountains sea, but there is no Längsschnittperspektive, which considers the territory in its entirety."
He has, at least in his case that the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a goal with the architects of the Tors clash.
In his view, the city should guarantee that the Strip directly via the Ronda de Dalt equipped in all its length is a soft transition between town and green zones.
Casino Jonás Larrazábal awards is freed
After 72 days of silence liberated the plenipotentiary of the casino Red is the brother of the mayor of Monterrey's trial against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days in captivity, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the plenipotentiary of the casino Red him before the criminal court of the southern, which leads the process against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for blackmail.
Following the attack on the casino Royale Sergio Gil Garcia, the owner of the casino Red, a series of photographs and videos, where Manuel Jonás is to see him allegedly forced to pay a sum of money, so that the city government approved the secret operation of the competitions.
According to the criminal complaint opened the prosecution criminal proceedings against the brother of the panistischen mayor, was arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours with the officials of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales was Casa de Arraigo 1 Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
In this place, he remained 49 days after a second arrest warrant after the officials of the Ministerio Público rejected the offences of corruption and organised crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the detention centre of Cadereyta, because he allegedly bribed the owners of the casino Red with one and a half million pesos had, however, he remained only a few hours in the central security row, because of death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to the trial as an inmate of urban prison in San Nicolás de Los Garza.
On 25 October was sent to him by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the southern, Jorge Yánez, a regulation that noted that after almost two months of formal investigations have sufficient evidence to open Jonás to speak for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house this in return.
On Monday the casino consisting of Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez judge José Luis Pecina, brother of the mayor to cancel the penalty, which is why he was released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias asked the officials assigned to the court Ministerio Público, García Gómez, whether this was repaired the damage and the owner of the betting house his forgiveness. The lawyer's name, however.
According to the lawsuit 197/2011 Jonás Larrazábal will be acquitted in the following can be no objections to the process, it also requires no damages.
After the hearing of the agent of the House, betting against 15.50 Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, urban prison of San Nicolás de Los Garza, Jonás to announce that he would be acquitted, and his case to the files.
He also informed him about the judicial order for immediate release.
The Secretary Dionisio Perez Jácome gives details of the accident, in which the government secretary, Francisco Blake and seven other people were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y transportation - SCT (Secretariat for communications and transport in Mexico), that the findings on the accident, in which the government secretary, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people were killed, pointing out that the helicopter with his entire intact structure directly against the ground clashes, without the pilot, a Notlandung.
At a press conference, said Dionisio Perez Jácome, secretary for communications and transportation, that the pilot had confirmed before the start, the weather conditions are suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the Propellerflügel in 25 metres had contact with trees, and the helicopter lost the hulls, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also said that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, which is why he met all the conditions for the transportation of personnel.
He also said that the investigations in the area where the plane came down was no helicopter parts were found.
" In the search were no plane parts found in other areas, the surcharge was the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, which is why he met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a Schrägung from 7 to 30 degrees.
It is currently a priority to get the results as soon as possible, but this could be several months, perhaps even a year.
For its part, assured Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for aircraft and emergency services in Mexico) that the helicopter by the Estado Mayor Presidencial flown the surcharge with Reisefluggeschwindigkeit and the plane had fallen to a soft Abhang.
"This information strengthens the assumption that at the time of the collision was a normal flight operation."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome six relevant points, which should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the standards, it was a flight to the rules of flight, which means that the team during the flight and on the ground have had sufficient perspective.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start of flying in the direction of the border area between Mexico City and Mexico state withdrew some low-hanging clouds.
Elected routes:
It is possible that the team because of the clouds of a lower area with a better view, selected in the direction of the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording the helicopter agree perhaps it has been a deviation from the flight route before the impact of either a loss of control over the plane.
Verstreuung the remnants of the plane in a limited area:
The information available to date suggests that the helicopter was aufgeprallt from the other and lateral direction.
The pattern of dispersed plane debris suggest that the helicopter with his aufgeprallt intact structure on the ground.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remnants of the aircraft offer on the scene of an accident either fire close to the explosion.
The latest findings indicate several ground contacts.
In the on-site investigations were found aircraft parts of 9200 feet above sea level; the terrain is slope and a Schrägung from seven to 30 degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to break.
Some information suggests that the helicopter could have several ground contacts.
After a meticulous search in an area on the abgesperrten area was the scene of an accident, could not be found scattered aircraft parts, with the assumption that caring for the aircraft structure against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol for the location of the gene for obesity in
Social Security Institution, Mexico's leading a research project for the location of the gene for obesity in children and young people, which will be supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Security Institution of Mexico) announced that it found a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and young people under the title " the genetics of obesity in childhood and youth, with the genetic markers associated with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (department for medical research, the focus of biochemistry at the clinic Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, declared that a multidisciplinary team, consisting of doctors, health workers, food specialists and social workers.
This team will be supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate degree course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The public is invited to take part in the study interested parties can come to the sports venues of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8.00 a.m. tests with children and young people.
He stressed that the investigation at the sports ground of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state México) began at the sports ground of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state México) will continue since 8 October.
If the goal of 500-600 people inquiry is achieved, the study will be continued in the south of the main city district) on the sports ground of Independencia (and the Morelos (in the north of the city's main district).
He said that the aim of the study was the intermixing of factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the world's Day of diabetes, he said that three thousand children and young people aged from six to 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents ' food-related questionnaires to fill.
You could also be questions about their physical activity and family illness history, risk factors, diabetes or renal insufficiency, to control.
He also led the inquiry, people called Saturdays (weight, size, Taillenumfang), controlled their blood pressure and blood values such as glucose levels, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López stressed that the investigation would be carried out at the concern of health staff about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys showed that in less than six years, the proportion of obese boys 77% and girls with obesity 47% increase from 1999 and 2006, and the obesity has risen dramatically," the expert said of the IMSS.
He admitted that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of Mexico's population differences from other nations.
He admitted that a Mexicans (), on average, 65 percent of Indian-American, European, 30 per cent and 5 per cent of African descent, which is in the genes with diabetes and obesity-related.
More generally, he said, put the genetics of obesity in the inability to burn the surplus to energy (calories), stored in the form of fat.
The researchers said, would be a direct benefit to the research participants in a comprehensive study of the children, found in whether a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even the appearance of dark skin wrinkles in the back of the neck and Innenarm (Akanthosis) on the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes at the preliminary stage.
All of the information would be treated as confidential and in writing, doctors told the parents, the doctors say the parents of all the measurements and beat them with lifestyle changes, which are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López said that there are three fundamental factors, which are responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, the lack of movement in their daily lives, most of the time to spend the day in front of the television and to use the means of transport, rather than short routes to walk.
The high caloric intake, which means an increased consumption of gezuckerten drinks and Kohlenhydraten (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.), along with a high absorption of fat and protein and genetics, which will be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt prevented the UNAM potholes
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of Chemistry in the Mexican University UNAM developed with Polymeren modified asphalt, in order to make the mixture resilient to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
That would avoid the sign by the road surface, respected, it would not be necessary, almost 200000 potholes to repair when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (town area of the valley of Mexico) breaks out, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the School of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the Asphaltbelags adequately happen, the number of potholes to significantly reduce or even fully.
In his lecture, "potholes from a technical point of view," he felt during the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible Polymeren modified asphalt is developing a similar asphalt mix, but a major mechanical resistance in both high as low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt in areas with extremely hot climate, such as, for example, in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the surface and to avoid the appearance of blow holes.
He said that the asphalt - the hardest part of the oil - a hydrocarbon link, part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part is a low - the so-called Malthene together they give the road surface to be typical zähelastisches behavior.
Zähelastisches behavior Asphalts means that this is behaving at high temperatures of nearly 180 degrees as a liquid, it is very zähflüssig 120 degrees and 50 degrees almost, while he is crumbling at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resilience of the Asphalts on the streets is not a uniform, but in a day, depending on the changing weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer.
The researchers said the FQ, the streets of Mexico City have been mostly a flexible road surface from six layers of material, which included the last three asphalt.
Between the upper classes is a layer of decay from asphalt from small, profusely in asphalt and entrenched stones.
Each individual piece, this decay, was profusely in asphalt.
If the vehicles to move and forces produced this class is a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it would be modified asphalt, the forces would be even better," said the chemical engineer.
" The erosion, " he said, " will be interpreted in a final layer of the so-called Tragschicht, which consists of tiny stones, from sand, was also in asphalt.
Since these shifts in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need more mechanical than the class decay and friction.
The road surface which receives most of the forces and distributed Tragschicht also needs a proper thickness and the material from which it needs to be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are more important to take into account factors, especially the water, "he said," because it affects the behavior of the class decay.
If the terrain is damp, water in the class and only difficult from this causes a relaxation of all sections of the road surface and, as a result, the incidence of stroke holes.
If a pothole, " he said, " first-class deck dismantled brick-by-brick, while the class wear only affected, but the damage is not immediately, but it is a process that should be the first sign by adequate maintenance programs maintained. "
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Mexico's research system) declared that the burden of the vehicle, another important reason for the emergence of blow holes so the thickness of each layer of the surface always stand in relation to the vehicle and it must be ensured that to prevent frequent blow holes this rule will be met.
Rafael Herrera has pointed out that there is still much research to wait, for example, Asphaltemulsionen in other countries are already on the market, and the potholes and repair the application of high temperatures.
What was missing to the candidate del Valle, the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors which restraint that Melina Ramírez Serna, not the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives his 14th title failure.
Once again, Valle del Cauca was empty when the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina had Ramírez Serna content to stand on the winners podium, a silver crown and the bond that they, as a new Miss expels Colombia.
With the outcome of this night received in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, something, the Department is already entitled to 14 failures and Melina the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, the crown almost had kept in the hands of the proclaimed Misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rosemary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question many are asking is: what?
Because the result is in line with the decline of a great favorite in every demonstration had shown that they had received about everything, the new Miss Colombia to be not in vain, it was the queen of the police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue elected titles, including the beauty queens, Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor, which is regarded as crucial to the decision of the jury, to appoint the first failure, is that it has the answer to the question "what books you most and why?" She asked the Carreta litre Arias Leamos of Martín Murillo Gómez was not convinced.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
" I read a lot, I believe in the literature, I think it is a kind of civilizing, ultimately, I believe that the book for my childhood shaped hardest, ' The small prince ' is a very deep book.
At the moment I read ' guilt and atonement. " It is a book of universal culture, we should all read, I read a book by Irene Nemirovski a Russian girl, a beautiful book that says ' passions.
An answer to, firstly, because of the concept of ' civilised ' and, secondly, because she had not explained how each called her book influenced them.
But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina to feel calm and happy with the result, " the universe is wise, it is what needs to be done.
And for all people: please read a little bit of ' The small prince '; it is a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite out of El Valle.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that it was favouring the stresste all Beifälle reaps and in the run-up to all get prices (gastronomy competition Easter, public vote on the best handgeschneiderte suit and Reina Madre), "the other candidates possessive had made what the Queen, who is not on the stage to shine."
And it noted in its first presentation in a bathing suit on the beach, the Hilton Hotel and its two elevators in the coronation ceremony.
Although they were both safe, it lacked the strength and momentum, the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme " como en casa ' Channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, " shows that the candidate wins during the competition, most prices eventually will not be queen. "
Moreover, Valle was at the end of the press from the road - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle cannot convince the Jurie regarding their interest in social work, what is the essence of the national beauty contest.
It will have a reason that two days before the international jury " Lucy Doughty said it sought a woman for the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia must look beyond the Körperliche and focus on the social perception that they are already participating in the competition had been involved in projects," she said.
There is also speculation that Valle with their defects of Derriere and fibrosis, she said in the stomach area had sinned, but this is contradictory, because it gave the jury as a candidate for natural beauty with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work.
The coach of the king, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that it was better, "but the problem with the fibrosis belly, for me, frankly, hard to say, their score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist is Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believe the fault of the woman from Valle del Cauca were subjected to the surgery, which they had been.
" The operations are OK, but Valle did not know how they should make it right.
Her body has never been their strong side, and they had to pay. "
Because of this prize, which will be the first time by the National beauty contest, after the appearance in a bathing costume cruel forecasting, which should be true in the night, it was getuschelt that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize, they do not benefit from the crown.
Regardless of whether that is true or not, it is a fact that Melina today their governing year, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position which provides the opportunity to appoint the national beauty contest Colombia in an international competitions.
However, it will be one of the queens, despite their overwhelming outburst for Cartagena escaped injury, was to go down in history.
This was the work of the doctor, identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoskopist went from Cali as the man "Alfonso Cano" identified in history.
The work of these officials, plays a key role.
On November 4, a Lophoskopist the investigative unit of the prosecutor (CTI) from Cali, as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), "Alfonso Cano" comparison of the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of CTI this week Eliazar Gonzalez on call, a man from Puerto Tejada of criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career worked González in communities of Chocó, where he had often for five days in the jungle to reach the place where the corpses, he should identify.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and after the completion of the necessary specialized courses on Lophoskopie is exposed to the investigation of the skin, the friction is obvious and Fußflächen.
In the week of the operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano was Eliazar pointed out clothes for at least three days.
Great things expected of him.
He flew Friday night in the helicopters of Palmira after Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two corpses, and that was the suspicion that the man had the oldest guerrilla in the world, could be why he should take ten finger-printing sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached with the investigation, the place where the body was, he could not identify because of his physical appearance, because this resembled the pictures he had seen in the mass media, not in the slightest.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass ink, compared Pflanzkelle and pocket torch Eliazar the fingerprints of the corpse with the fingerprinting.
He was right: it was, "Alfonso Cano."
The same night was originating from Puerto Tejada man responsible for the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, to announce that it is the leader of the FARC.
In search of traces
For a Daktyloskopen from Sijín in Cali was appreciating the President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar Gonzalez at a press conference on the use of "Cano," very important.
Many people are not familiar with our work.
The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the dissolution of a crime.
Lophoskopisten identify not only corpses, they also support an investigation into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of those arrested.
Many criminals in their arrest false identity papers or they do not have.
We are taking fingerprints and looking them in the database.
The researchers told us that he had to grab a theft of a piece of wall from a house, because the thief had aufgestützt exactly at this point, with his hand as he stuffed with jewelry and money herauszog Safe.
"The walls are difficult because their surface are unsuitable for fingerprints, but in this case, we were able to identify the imprint of the whole and the offender in several thefts took part," he remembered.
With the help of fingerprints murder suspects can also be exonerated or tainted.
Recently, one death, surrounded by bottles of spirits.
The investigation was suspected that a family member could be tatverdächtig and actually voted a fingerprint on the bottle.
Although that is not guaranteed that the murderer, he brought to the place where the crime was committed.
A Daktyloskopist of CTI declared that "the fingerprints taken from the object with chemical or physical reacto."
If they seem a Pflanzkelle or used for carriage.
The prints will be sent to Asif, that is the criminal database, or to Personenstandamt.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians are undocumented," said the expert from the CTI.
He said that not everything is as it is portrayed in the TV series of SCI.
So all is not gold that glitters is not everything that treats a fingerprint.
But it can be used if an appropriate comparison.
The "outraged" call on the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators huddling in tents on the Zuccotti Square.
A large part of the eviction orders and changed his location in a nearby park.
The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street demanded this Tuesday, the New York authorities, as they sought a court order to enter the Manhatten Square after they cleared the room at dawn and had tried to occupy a different place in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators pushed the Zuccotti Square, with a court order, "outraged" allowed to gain access to new tents at this point, while another part of the movement's eviction orders and occupied a park further north in the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to campen on the square, we come together in a different place, and the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti continue with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the movement, "Ocupy Wall Street."
Bray said that the response of the " outraged " at the evacuation of their tent camp directly ordered by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, until it came before the court, where the judge " Lucy Billings a kindred order forbade the forced evacuation of the place and the demonstrators approved the tents.
Moreover, the occupied "outraged," a new park, which is at the crossroads of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue in the vicinity of the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, the New York and New Jersey links, and the property of the Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the site for at least one hour, but then the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although no precise figures, Bray. He assured the Efe Agency, that he was among several journalists with handcuffs.
The organisation had joined hundreds of people at this point, there were a group of religious leaders as a sign of their support of the members of the movement and communicating with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square (a private property) closed in anticipation of a court hearing is scheduled for this Tuesday, and the legality of the place at dawn clearance should be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators pushed by the seat of photocopies wore this court warrant in and distributed them; they gave even some policemen guarded the place, which had "some small clashes," as Bray reported the number of police had beaten demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street, as well as the application of laws, which were adopted after the occupation and to prohibit the demonstrators with their tents and other things that they had previously used to go back into the park. "
Mayor Bloomberg is clear before the press, which had been due to this court warrant the re-opening of the square for the public and the protesters lifted the demonstrators, he pointed out that the city laws, they are not allowed to set up again with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor defended personally carried out at dawn evacuation of the Zuccotti-Platz, nearly 200 people were arrested and it was decided, because the demonstrators ' contravened the law. "
Bloomberg said that he had given the order to the evacuation of the job because he had turned into a place where people were not Demonstrieren, but to break the law and, in some cases, other people to harm, " because " some shops have received threats, " and the residents began to worry " about their quality of life. "
"The evacuation at dawn was sickening and shows that Bloomberg is basically on the protection of financial interests and is not interested in protecting the interests of the North American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, the mayor anschuldigte "not to respect the freedom of the press."
The Occupy Wall Street, that they thought about it, "major actions" to organise for Thursday, together with community organizations and unions, the two months now, to commemorate the protests since 17 September.

Japan will be born again after the earthquake
The GDP grows by 1.5%, thanks to the domestic consumption and stop the cycle of a free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, was paralyzed on the Japanese economy, which is still in the recovery after the devastating earthquake, which results in a nuclear crisis and the worst catastrophe, Japan was the second world war.
The initial estimates of the government in Tokyo, the property damage at $300000, which, despite the difficult economic situation in the world, it seems.
After three quarters of case, the details of the gross domestic product between July and September, finally to close this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% of the hochgerechnete quota for the year.
The fastest growth in the second quarter, as measured by value in Japan's business year in March 2012 - also means since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery in part through the sale of machinery for rebuilding the areas devastated by the earthquake and the tsunami that followed.
Indeed, the companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the drop of 0.9% for capital expenditures, which were recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of relentless increases.
Nevertheless, the real turnaround of the Japanese economy is not exclusively from Keynesian incentives to use the crisis to build infrastructure or build new ones.
Woke up, Japan is particularly thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, initiated by the growing spending on cars, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of yen
Tokyo has entrusted to the domestic market, after the yen - the Japanese currency - in one of the "safe currencies" of investors fleeing the debt crisis of the euro zone and the dire predictions for the U.S.A., a privilege as a tombstone in the accounts of export companies.
With a tougher currency are the products more expensive abroad, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, led their weak business results from July to September, the quotation of the yen.
While the markets continue to besieged the peripheral EU countries, the government remains vigilant Yoshihiko Noda.
"We must look at the continuing risks, for example, the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday that the secretary of state for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are not very aufheiternd.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that most of the member states in September contained clearer signs of a slowdown of economic development.
The indicator, which provided the turning points of the world economy, brought to light that the brakes would be the biggest economic powers.
Because he fell four-tenths to rid of 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below the average value of 100, after they fell by eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens doubts
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will sign a written agreement
With the risk premiums pushed in the peripheral countries and insecurity among disruptive Greece strays in the labyrinth, from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek interim government is more of a response to pressure from Brussels as a genuine conviction of political forces, slowly by the facts.
While the new prime minister, Lucas Papadimos yesterday pointed out that there are no alternatives to the structural reforms and the agreed at the time of his appointment a hundred days may be too short for their implementation, assured the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, that he will take the new austerity measures to support and not his call for new elections on the planned date of 19 February.
"The main task of this government is the implementation of the decisions were taken at the summit on 26 October," assured Papadimos yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government will reach its peak.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, to reform the disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samaras communication acknowledges the doubts about his position: "we have committed to support the transitional government, but otherwise nothing."
The conservative leader was a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organism, the 8000 m, Athens, entsperren must urgently needed, and he made it clear that he would not be undertaking on the fulfilment of the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is due to the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum still irritated yesterday reaffirmed their demand was not to shake: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties, "a clear written agreements would not be as soon as possible."
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the troika " very soon " to return to Athens, in order to discuss with the new government, " for the payment of the sixth section of 8000 million euros " is needed, " although there is still no definitive date.
The Greek knot has for a while.
Queen Sofía: "these are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasised the "dominant" Spain's position in relation to this type of financing
Spain has reached the world's dominant position in the role of micro-financing. "
The Queen Sofía of Spain yesterday recalled that Spain have developed over the last two decades, the world's second donors for funds for international cooperation, "essence" is based on the fact that it is a "tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for the whole of humanity on the basis of trust in the people."
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the fifth world summit on micro-credit in Valladolid was convinced that there is " no doubt " that this kind of business would be " absolutely essential " by the United Nations by the year 2015, set out to achieve the millennium goals, and " especially the aim of the number of people who have to live with income of less than a dollar a day, below the " poverty line ."
Spain also continues the expansion of the network beneficiaries "until the last corner of the world, and it does this task responsibly," said the Queen Sofia, hopes that the initiatives and contributions from the summit, which lasts until Thursday, will be guaranteed, "the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest people, and especially for women," as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have seen many successes" and "face many challenges."
The summit on micro-credit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform to push "two fundamental goals."
The Queen said that it will be pursued by the end of the year 2015, 175 million poor families have access to financial services, and that 10 million of these households exceed the poverty line.
The concept of micro-credit in Spain and the rest of the world, initiated by Muhammad Yunus ' years ago path ," the Queen Sofia as an " act of justice and recognition. "
The father of this financial instrument described them as "admirable idealists, dedicated to the fight against poverty" and whose work they have known for 15 years, when the queen traveled to Bangladesh in order to get the loan strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later, the first world summit in Washington, and further meetings in the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006, and we all have seen a steady development, "said the Queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday the assessment as" head of the family "in Valladolid and advocate of the poor."
They finally ended the Queen Sofia their lecture by spurring people to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
" Ethical imperative '
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said that solidarity "an ethical imperative" for the whole of the democratic state.
In this sense, she emphasized that it was a mistake to link development aid in times of economic boom, because it was a "lasting commitment."
Jiménez was of the opinion that the micro-credit not to allow a " serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty " and that the governments of the industrialized countries are now more than ever, " solidarity criteria, and that the solidarity of the crisis.
For Spain, micro-credits are "the most important forms of development aid."
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, to applaud "success," "marginalized" people, "the always closed doors" to give "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, the present in a city, "their doors, infected by the spirit of solidarity open."
The CDU proposes that the EU president due to choose general vote
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real trouble.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but in the autumn, especially those activists are enough to make the government policy on the Greeks today and tomorrow, possibly Italy as too lax.
The presidential motion proposed by the Bureau of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Under 1001 delegates had only nine voted against ten had abstained from the vote.
The continuing several minutes Standing ovation from their first Interventionserlässen Angela Merkel, as well as a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, could be part of the three Euro-minded finance minister, no doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor - as well as the subsequent application - slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs directly dependent on the euro."
The Chancellor is the time for a breakthrough in Europe. "
This could come through the control of the European Union, reinforcing modification of the Treaty of Lisbon on the budget policies of the countries in the euro zone; it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission, on the basis of general voting "in order to give Europe a face."
However, this is one of the amendment proposals adopted by Congress, which clearly Wolfgang Schäuble godfather.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 quickly agree on this revolution: Greater Britain is opposed to the cause, and the chief of the CDU to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same.
The milestone, however.
The delegates have rejected the weighting of any country in the ECB's Governing Board in accordance with the weighting of individual economies in an overwhelming majority of the proposal, which is clearly a comeback that Germany's position.
The sunset on calming the climate within their party Chancellor has strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but it has not tried to win its congress at the expense of the ' small ' or in European countries, which would immediately give the arrogant Germany.
As far as the European request the relevance of the "Franco-German friendship" devotes a clause, Angela Merkel, France is not on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because it recalls that Leipzig two centuries ago, was at the centre of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the zuhöchst humiliating defeat of the Napoleonic army.
What represents the Krank fraud stories?
After the family aid UMP and the government to take the Krank in attack.
Nicolas Sarkozy on Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux, a family of aid coffers and a speech on the - since 2007, always recurrent - subject of the fight against social and economic dependence on the state.
In order to accompany this attack by the desire to undergo the economy in a tough test, but on the other hand, no less a harbinger of an axis of right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to concentrate workers sick.
First of all with economic budget targets: the government reshape the introduction of a fourth-day leave before a speech Krank workers in the private sector.
In plain English, this means that a sick workers without approval of the specific company wage would lose by four days, so at least 15% of its monthly income.
A measure which, according to the newspaper, "les echoes" threatens to provoke anger, however, would help to 280 million euros.
The other measure with a rather symbolic nature accompanied: state officials unvergüteten waiting in the event of illness (so far, there is for them, Gegensatze three days waiting in the private sector, no waiting period).
While these issues in the debate, sparked by the majority of the fraud issue, this time on the abuse associated with labour shortage.
"Checks will be much more important and, moreover, they are rückzuvergüten, if it is required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, 13 November, before the microphone of the station RTL.
As in other cases, seem to the effects of this reporting about the reality of fraudulent activities in the areas of Krank reports a little disproportionate.
This is, in fact, since 2002, the subject of permanent observation and political offensive operations, the most frequently borne fruit.
The French are no longer ill more often than people elsewhere in Europe.
We dwell, however, the nationwide figures.
According to the country's health insurance fund CNAM more than EUR 237 million daily compensation paid in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of health care, the daily compensation with 11.3 billion euros, 5% of health expenditure in 2008.
Under this amount fell 46% on maternity leave and work-related accidents and illness leave on 54%, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
And, therefore, 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, have been given to the French to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, on average, only 14.5 sick days.
Midway, covered up the differences: a different monster twitter.com, Web site for career planning, was published in 2007, showed that 75% of 40,000 claimed that French workers have taken a single hospital.
A different, this time covered by the health insurance study clarifies that 37% of the Krank reports of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% in 2010.
Compared with their European neighbours, the French workers tend to not more than elsewhere, to work.
A global shortage in 2010, by two researchers from the French state-owned Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) carried out long-term study showed that between 1994 and 2001, the fragmented rate (or otherwise) oszillierte in France between 10% and 11% to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The Krank fraud reports represents a tiny share in terms of undeclared work.
Regarding the fraud is only a weak levels.
Encouraging the legislation since 2002, means that there is systmatische controls Krank reports exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public college education and training of technicians and engineers) below 1.5 million checks found that 13% of the 285000 carried short-term Krank reports in 37050 cases "unjustified or too long."
The systematic controlled Krankmeldungsfällen of more than 45 days was permanently under 1.2 million, 11% "aligned or unjustified" cases, which means 132000.
Overall, this makes so 169000 "unjustified" to several million workers who have a Krank notification.
A paragraph, only a weak number, for example, the undeclared work represents.
According to the UMP members Dominique Tian, author of a factual report published in July, is between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax profit loss per year, more than the total cost of daily expenses, and thus far more than the Defraudation in latter regarding this issue.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece have a new adjustment programme needed to absorb its economy.
This was announced on Monday, 14 in November, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament in addition to the fact that the government granted the EU a hundred days were not enough to do the job.
"In order to continue the efforts to find a resurgence of the economy, we need to support our European partners, as well as a new programme for the budget adjustment," said the head of government in his first public speech in the Eröffung the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro summit on 27 October, was " the main task of the new government, because the participation of the country within the euro zone " on the game, " he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos planned to reduce the government deficit of the country, " the 9% of gross domestic product from now until the end of the year, after the 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights rejected the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right-wing, had been on Monday its assent to the already approved measures regarding the escape from the debt crisis designed experiments, however, that his party is not ready to make an additional austerity measure would erkären.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at an assembly of his party, New Democracy.
He had agreed with the requirements of the reduction of the budget deficit and debt, such as the fight against waste, but any hostile policy towards the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, charged with economic and monetary challenges EU Commissioner, had prevented the IMF and the EU were to sign the necessary loans over 8 billion euros, not without a written guarantee of all parties whose support measures planned release, Antonio Samaras replied that his word is enough, and he is not under pressure from outside.
Euthanasia and accompanied Freitod must be legalised, a panel of experts
The Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel said that governments, institutions, health care and doctors about schmerzlindernder treatment worked together for the best pain relief funds, and also about the cases of cancer.
The Canadian society is living in a attitude towards the death.
Only 9% of Canadians can, in fact, with their doctor to talk about the conditions under which they wish to die and make provisions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, were involved in the six experts in various fields, among other things, ethics, law and medicine, are interlinked.
This body recommends the government to amend the criminal law, so in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this election, and patients are seen as able to make such a decision.
As a prelude to quote the experts, a recent poll published by the independent EIU society, the quality of death compared with each other in 40 countries around the globe.
Although Canada has placed on the 10th, the study noted that "the medical care of euthanasia in Canada has a culture in which people are afraid to touch on the subject of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, tell us the appointed experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the wish of the majority of Canadians to die at home, however, will die 68.6% of those in hospital.
The whole country is considered the rate with 86% occurred in hospital deaths in Quebec.
In the delicate question about euthanasia and accompanying Etem suicide, the authors of the report's conclusions, the position of the federal government, which has already expressed a wish to make any changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and accompanying Etem suicide counter.
But there is now, according to the experts, who also inspected all those countries whose approach legalised euthanasia and assisted suicide or decriminalising have no proof that such a decriminalisation of abuses in its application, the practice of euthanasia or accompanying Etem suicide of unkompetenten or not consenting individuals.
On the contrary, we meet far more cases of such violations in the countries in which euthanasia and accompany suicide are not, as yesterday, Jocelyn Downie, a co-signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"It will also accompany suicide in Canada, although clearly illegal," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
We have to say that, according to an Angus Reid poll, already 85% of the Canadians in favour of euthanasia had expressed in 2010, as they are of the opinion that allow people at the end of her life path to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the issue of euthanasia did not mean to convey the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people less value.
In terms of people who have already assisted suicide, the respondents represented 41% of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted.
What maintenance or suspension of patients, the situation is less clear, as the authors of the report.
Similarly, this should be in their recommendation list suggests that the criminal law indicated that cancelling the resources for a legal rejection, not as a criminal.
The panel of experts also calls for health care professionals should be trained in the task of cancelling the funds to respect life without fear of criminal prosecution.
The panel said that governments, institutions, health care and doctors about schmerzlindernder treatment worked together to provide the best pain relief funds, and also about the cases of cancer.
The panel calls on the far-reaching health care in the Canadian institutions used to pain relief or final measures, at least to consider, because this little euthanasia have served to reduce physical pain and those related to the same procedure.
Other reservations experts
Some experts in the field of law of health care have reservations about the conclusions of the report, experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, the attitude of the undersigned report experts described as "extreme," among other things, as these euthanasia practice in the final stages of any borders.
"This opens the doors for a situation in which anyone tired of life and is older than 18 years, to ask another person, he had seen in his suicide to help," RA Deschamps yesterday a summary of the report.
RA Deschamps also emphasised to the authors of the report seemed the responsibility of the individual over all other values, which are involved in the social Gewirke society.
But now, he says, there are guidelines and obligations in a society. "
Margaret Somerville, specializing in health law, also has "strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report expressed it as a "pro-euthanasia manifesto titulierte."
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular, questioned the report's claims on the freedom of abuses in certain countries in which legalised euthanasia and accompanied suicide, such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.

The Turkish diplomats chief, Ahmet Davutoglu, for its part, had complained that since the beginning of the year, aimed at the Syrian regime, Turkish mediation attempts have been unsuccessful.
"Those in the Middle East, which must not be at peace with their people, and this is not satisfactory," he said in reference to Syria, the neighbouring country, Turkey has steadily nastier growing attitude.
The United States has welcomed the "intensification of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have ever more fiercely tone, given the repression in Syria," observed Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.

He has responded with emphasis on the decision of the Arab League, Damascus from its tasks to suspend what his assessment after a "dangerous step."
Syria "will not give in," he added under the assurances, "the plot was forged against Syria would fail."
After the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League currently is investigating a "mechanism for protecting civilians," and wants the deployment of 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers in the country.
The French foreign trade minister Alain Juppé had also spoken out in favour of the deployment of UN observers, civilians against repression of the regime, after him in his "encysted paranoia" to protect.

The EU is convinced that Rome, his goal of balancing the budget in 2013, despite the apprehended austerity plans will not achieve in these last few months, in particular, has requested new tough measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, head of the Chiefs ' Italy on Tuesday will meet Monti also insists on the need for economic stimulation, "as a country that has no growth, the deficit figures may not respect."
M. Monti, who is known for his expertise and his independence as an EU commissioner (1994-2004), stands for "epochal change" in Italy after 17 years, "Berlusconismus"; "professor" symbolises the "challenge of trustworthiness" and "another Italy," the editorial writers.
The big unknown here seie the longevity of his Stabes.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy from now until April 2012 for 200 billion euros of government bonds.
Russian scientists helps the Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko, Iran has helped to develop a nuclear weapon usable detonator, confirmed on Monday, a specialist on nuclear risks, American NGOs.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS advises the outcome of the recent report by the International Agency for Nuclear Safety AIEA and others from the UN agency documents to identify the scientist.
The AIEA announced last week its "serious concern" at a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the detailed study of the AIEA-ISIS advises documents from 1934, had apparently born Danilenko worked since the beginning of the 1960s over three decades in a Soviet Militärnuklearzentrum in Chelyabinsk (Urals), and was involved in the explosion produced synthetic diamonds.
In 1989 and 1991, he should have left the center in order to start a business in Kiev, the "nano-diamonds."
The economic difficulties of his company had led to the Iranian embassy in Ukraine to contact in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he was then an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report mentioned the AIEA "strong indications that Iran's development of a Nuklearsprengstoffsystems supported through the work of foreign experts, not just in this technology is extremely seie, but also as a member of the agency, his entire professional career on essential direct military nuclear energy programme in his country of origin, have been working on this technology."
Anti-Islamic crimes and offences have increased by 50%
The targeted crimes and offences against Muslims have risen by 50% from 2009 to 2010, whereas other racially or religiously motivated crimes of violence, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday in the same period either slightly decreased or have only increased.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes against Muslims from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, has risen by 49%, whereas a 13% increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% fall against Jews targeted crimes as well as a global increase of 14% of anti-religious crimes and offences.
The total motivated paragraph "hate crimes" in a very weak increased at 6628 cases, including 47.3% racial differences and 20% motivated by religious differences crimes, such as the FBI.
"After a slowdown in 2009, it is worrying that these crimes and offences to grow again," said the human rights organisation Human Rights First, ."Der rise of anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organisation added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes as a serious infringement of human rights should be considered," added Paul Legendre, a representative of the organisation.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added under assessment that it could improve the police attitude towards the "hate crimes."
"Hate crimes" in the US federal law as a legacy from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King, in order to punish acts of violence directed against race, colour, religion or origin, and are now just as sexual crimes affiliation.
Twitter is changing the platform and ever more closely resembles Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter has introduced on Monday, changes in the presentation of its platform in order to allow their users, in particular, to monitor the activities of those who follow their entries, which are similar to the service, once again, those of Facebook.

Austria
A " golden budget rule in the constitution
In Austria's government in power of the great socialist/Christian Democrat coalition has decided on Tuesday to include a " golden budget rule in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and avoid a possible degradation by credit rating agencies in the top-rated Austria (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Mr Faymann, personally, is the decision of the exit door of the Council of Ministers, although the public Austrian state debt 74.6%, far above the set by the Maastricht Treaty criterion of 60%, but well below the debt levels of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"The solvency of Austria not fallen at a stroke from AAA to AA +, we would have three billion euros each year to pay interest rates," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democrat Foreign Minister.
Austria is also a demand of the Brussels summit of countries in the euro zone on 26 October: the heads of state and government had demanded the inclusion of reducing public deficits by the end of 2012, and a return to the public accounts of the same weight in the Constitution or by adopting a similar law.
The action taken by the Austrian government similar to the "German model" because Germany was the first European country to such a "rule" was included in the Constitution.
By the year 2017 should reduce the structural budget deficit every year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP), from 2017 should not exceed the structural budget deficit, the state's 0.35% of GDP, whereas the regional states, as well as the communities should have balanced budgets.
The aim is to eradicate the budget debt under the Maastricht agreement established 60% criterion in the horizon of 2020/21.
Strong yen
Noda is threatened with a new intervention in currency markets
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda on Tuesday warned that the Japanese authority would intervene in the currency markets, the yen should continue to rise.
" We should see an excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen, " we will intervene, just as we did last time, " said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was again close to the historic level of aufgeschnellt the Japanese authorities forced the intervention on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo had massively sold yen against the dollar, in order to reduce the Japanese currency value, which is hitting a new record since 1945, against the dollar.
The yen has risen, but regularly, doped by purchases by investors, who see the yen as a "refuge" value in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has fallen below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro is below the symbolic bar of 105 yen in the vicinity of the levels slipped the last intervention getriggert.
Traded on the dollar to 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen before the financial crisis of 2008-2009.
This whimsical Japanese motto is damaging to the exports of the archipelago, as it reduces the cost of the ' Made in Japan ' products more expensive and drawn from abroad by Japanese firms in income, since these these in the country's currency exchange.
"Japan is struggling after the earthquake and tsunami on March 11, the Tohoku region devastated (North East) have feared for its reconstruction," stressed M. Noda, this rise of the yen could kill the weak recovery in germs.
The third world economic power, with the growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter for the first time, thanks to the export increases and consumption by the disaster, "plombierten" households again gained traction this year.
The Prime Minister, however, estimates that the rise of the yen, "Japan's economic fundamentals am reflecting."
The Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for its part, the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee has asked to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, however, has informed the BoJ have already taken "appropriate measures," which he said deported to expect that on Wednesday, no additional monetary easing.
At the last meeting at the end of October, had spent the Fed their Staatsobligationsankäufe 5000 billion yen (47 billion euros), the 55000 billion yen (519 billion euros) to cover amounts to pay for various purchases of securities had to flood the liquidity market.
Euro zone:
Füsse interest rates skyrocketing, stock markets climb
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis steadily undermined European indices.
Despite the official opening of the new leaders in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany to increase the rates of steadily weakened Länders.
The stock market, which is still concerned about the stability of the euro zone are drifting this Tuesday, 15 November, a little more negative pastures.
In Paris, the CAC at 10.00, 1.4% and fell to 3064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London down 0.1%.
" Because of the new tensions on the government-bond yields in the in the euro zone, the world's stock markets, a part of their recent gains.
"Investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of infection," says Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters press agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which closed in the fear of market participants about the capacity in Europe, the debt crisis continue, with a market downturn of 0.7%.
"Japan has directed as well as the rest of the world has its eyes on Europe, and the trade is moving towards a limited variations corridor, until investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," reckons Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This revival of the concern about the future of the euro zone is damaging the single currency, their bear on Tuesday.
The euro moved for one and a half months to its lowest level.
The European currency was worth 1.3570 newborn against 10.00 p.m., it was 0.4%.
According to the traders decreased after the CDU party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered on Monday in Congress, a request that had, in particular, the possibility for troubled countries from the euro zone, without at the same time, to leave the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates are far below the 6% limit.
Loan rates of Italy and Spain continue to be very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian bonds over 10 years, the Spanish title of fruit to 6.2% 6.85%.
These tensions of interest rates in the Südländern, but also in France, continues to fuel the fears of investors.
The future of Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti called for more time to the markets, the paralysis threatened by the debt situation in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirms the implementation of the decisions taken at the on 27 October summit of the euro zone, "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in Visir markets since Sunday's parliamentary elections in the country.
The interest rate gap ("spread" between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has reached a new historic high.
In anticipation of growth figures for the eurozone
Statistically, France had a planned budget consumption, economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, so a little better than the expected 0.3%.
The statistical Federal Office INSEE had reviewed the arranging of the figures of the second quarter, with a deficit of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP), instead of a stagnation.
In truth, it is the fourth quarter, economists worried the most.
Germany had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
An initial projection of the euro area as a whole is expected at 11.00 a.m., with the EU Commission warns against the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
The facts should prevail over dogma
There is an issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, so this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly in the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the company.
It is reasonable to take a choice for a reason to reflect on this issue and the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if they explored all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should sound their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people on this planet, the demographic evolution, a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, should not have a huge share of the world's population on a vital element.
At the same time, we must mitigate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to be able to continue to consistently produce electricity without the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue disappeared from the environmental debate, to forget in order to fight against climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident changed any of these parameters.
Therefore, blebt Germany remains isolated in his decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which imposes its decision, the need to find a replacement capable replacement source in Switzerland, which barely intends only to build nuclear power plants in the past generation.
Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few states to pursue their projects against it with determination.
The United States have decided after Fukushima, to rejoin her park another unit, set aside after the nuclear accident plant Three Mile Island again in operation.
Even if it focused on renewable energy sources, occasionally German model is portrayed as a model, but the reality of the discourse.
The election in Berlin, in the form of an increase in the price of electricity prices, enhanced by the increased use of Importgas especially energy dependence on Russia, a rise caused by gas and coal-fired power stations in CO2 emissions.
These unpleasant effects will already be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark is cause for reflection.
Denmark is a European leader tables in terms of wind energy, 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; because of its CO2 Ausstösse and electricity prices by 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay higher electricity bills, in contrast to our French households by 40%.
As the price of energy in the globalised economy, a key part of the ability to compete and a deposit of stability to the industry at national soil, the French company due to the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction on the nuclear power would be a strong increase in the price of energy, which liesse the noble statements about the re-industrialisation of our country and defending the purchasing power of the illusion.
Polls showed that a price that leaves the vast majority of French people, nor is prepared to pay, as opposition to the principle of this energy source.
Let us remind ourselves that the energy policies of our country has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410000-led jobs.
Because of their strong export character brings a host of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises on the international markets and creators of countless jobs.
France should take the decision to withdraw from nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs are victims, and the annual EUR 6 billion in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
What electricians would designed EPR work at 60 years if the decline is a recipe for his producers?
In order to solve the energy equation, we must acknowledge that there is not a work of the devil, a miracle cure for the production of electricity.
Developed by the company, Areva, low-carbon solutions to the use of nuclear power and renewable energy from the complementarity of energy sources.
To maintain the highest possible level of safety for nuclear power, an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a safety authority, uncompromising and transparent controls in existing plants, such as construction in Flamanville.
Working teams due to their professionalism have made a name, are just obsessed with security.
Within 50 years of nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only a single, and occurred at Three Mile Island is under normal operating conditions; it passed without consequences for humans and the environment.
Chernobyl was the drama created by reactor design and unendschuldbares, human error.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident of two unprecedented scale natural disasters caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident, as it had done after the two previous.
As a result of this approach and cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a draft, which would enable resilience to such phenomena.
Because it is considered among the electrical engineers than desirable to build a nuclear power plant to be turned, it would be a freeze in Flamanville a legendary gift to the competition from Areva and EDF, giving them free rein liesse leadership position in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is inevitable and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to dominate emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber debate, defined as economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration is a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized for a variety of perspectives - congestion by police, judicial and administrative bodies because of the figures derived policy, this policy of reconciliation with the status of a "country of human rights," as France had itself.
Recently, the official side against foreign students targeted harassment of the weeks, the Interior Minister had in passing (see Libération announced on 23 May) that France "no talent, masons or waitresses needed from abroad."
But this policy was only rarely, from an economic point of view.
There is a wide consensus between left and right on this issue.
The tone of Jacques Chirac has been dented by right-wing side, in 1976, had declared that "900000 unemployed people, including more than 2 million immigrant workers, no problem for a country should be" left-wing side by Michel Rocard, in 1990, France "could not take the whole world poverty."
The only difference is the level of generosity
The fear of invasion of national land by hordes of Polish plumber was divided in 2005 by both the right and the left.
Both camps, the immigrants were perceived as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is the extent to which the generosity, the immigrants are willing to admit.
Francois Hollande is limited in his programme banalities, pointing to a partnership venture development to solve our problems of migration. "
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, it may have an impact on the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As we remember the economic expert Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book that the latest findings on the immigration brings together (Exceptional People: how migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pages), among the specialists, a broad consensus about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration.
Restricting immigration would invalidate the growth and the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that they are threatening to find substitutes for the local workforce, particularly the less skilled, they exerted pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are much complementary truth as the domestic wage workers, because they focus on careers in sectors that are technically unutilised workplace.
The low-skilled immigrants to work in sectors that little domestic wage workers poking the better work among the immigrants in dynamic sectors in which the training is not aligned with the labour supply.
Positive wage effect
As a surgeon would have difficulties to work in a country where there is a lack of Anästhesisten, this complementarity between locals and migrants have a positive effect of immigrants moving on wages and domestic labour market situation.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way, a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants, a wateringdown, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And without taking into account the fact that the high proportion of immigrants sponsored diversity of ideas creation and economic growth is conducive to (naturalised immigrants with American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants.
The migrants also net social systems in European countries, on average, in a level of 1% of the total budget.
The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that a migrating to Germany at the age of 30 years, the person the public budget, on average, about his life, a net contribution (revenue minus spending) of the EUR 150000.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate, the lack of average points "with the teeth."
With these teeth, which should discourage immigrants, however, is exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy remains to European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset, there is also a delicate thing.
The European continent should be able to remind anyone who had their invention in Athens, more than two thousand years, the whole of the 20th century, the tragedies of the First World War, of totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but Franco in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some had believed, it will be enough to exercise the right to vote, and directly responsible as possible way democracy prevail over their enemies once and for all to see.
We know since Napoleon "small fry" that it was a feature of the spirit.
Universal suffrage is the necessary condition of democracy is not a sufficient condition and can be just as good "oppressive instrument," as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation of powers and control, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe, we find ourselves in is an economic crisis, but it is also very first and foremost policy and democracy crisis.
The change of attitude of the Greek casual counterfeiting referendum would have had a double insightful character in this respect: the need for a full return of the policy, but on the other side of the disturbing sense of the impossibility of their Unangebracht.
This ambivalence should be seen as outdated.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic fight today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain, in order to push for a successful national referendum, which organised the necessities and perverse sequence.
A free licence for the European dictator or a leap with blindfolds in the emptiness of the nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the nationals.
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, quite rightly, clear and steady, an election and democracy, this time at the European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you know, not more, where to put an end to the list - because there was only one crisis, and that there is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, bowing to the dictates of the markets and the credit rating agencies, which under his impotence and his lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe, which is humiliated at international level.
It is concerned about the transfer of sovereignty in the direction of Europe - it is the whole of Europe, which is beginning to lose its sovereignty, and every one of the nations connected to him.
The urgency is to give the popular sovereignty, the leadership of the European project.
Because it is located on the whole, whether the Europeans to reduce the burden of their debts from the markets and looking at a future investment.
The exit from the crisis has taken decisions at the European level to condition without total democratic legitimacy without sure to lead to ruin.
This proposal by Jacques Delors and the socialists fought for a long time, is now pushing any European economic governance.
I agree.
But it would be without political integration and greater democracy, as citizens, to imagine a new folly and another impasse.
We need a new stage of European integration.
In the Republic of France, it took the Republicans to create '. "
The revolution's interests alone was not enough.
This instruction remains valid.
We need a better economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by a politically democratic Europe creates a true European popular sovereignty.
We need to create Europe.
"Contact" smart cards for the common good
The World Fair opens for smart cards on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in their more optimistic attitude gates.
The year 2011 should be smart, according to the euro with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of Mikroprozessorchips (debit cards, SIM cards, phone), with more than 6 billion sold units.
The key segment is allowed to contact free technology payments on public transport or settling purchases by simply getting the card to a reading.
To predict a year sold 320 million this year, should contact 460 million unemployed smart cards will be sold throughout the world.
Their market share should increase further (580 million anticipated units), and more than 10% of the global smart cards market (6.925 million cards) to represent in 2012.
Europe wins on the contactless payment to soil, after a long period of the Asia-Pacific region dragged along behind.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75000 payment terminals to accept this.
In France the beginnings are modest: only 400000 unemployed contact visa cards have been distributed.
The consumer markets, however, to make steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued this year, 2.5 million contact free passport master cards.
In order to move to higher speed, it is necessary for the banks to provide their customers with these cards.
"Two great French financial institutions have committed to furnish their customers in the future, systematically bank cards, which are drawn with contactless chip," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe to France.
Banks test payment via mobile phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A very small percentage of the equipment is equipped with the implementation of these transactions necessary NFC technology (Near Field Communication).
"They are in default."
"But they should at least next year a real upward trend."
"We are counting on the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide," says Marc Bertin, chairman of euro Smart in 2012.
But the banks take the initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had yesterday announced the launch of a Testlaufes in Caen, from December until next June.
The iPhones some 200 customers and staff should be equipped with a " wall, allowing the contact free payment.
The BPCE is conducting a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale had testified yesterday to prepare for the market introduction of an offer to their customers to contact free payment via mobile phone.
Terrorists front goes from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relationship between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and sect Boko Haram.
The long suspected of the relations between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to confirm.
On Sunday, had acquired the Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdel Kader Messahel itself acknowledges that Algiers now "certainty."
"The way to go with both organizations and the relations of the secret services indicate a clear cooperation," he said without going into detail.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigation on the last January kidnap of two Frenchmen in Niger have promoted interfaces.
The kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory should be on the following days, at the same time as several of their captors at a French special forces carried out operation have been killed.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found in the rubble at the site of several phone chips, which were the terrorists.
Terrorists axis
The analysis of the telephone calls leads to several interlocutors, who are stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are interested in particular, the numbers of two interlocutors: No leads to a Nigerian who had a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram stopped; the other leads to a man who, as the Aqmi and sect close.
"This is a step forward, but we must wait and see, without doubt, clearer evidence before we can speak of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It is conceivable."
"You know for years that the financial and intellectual support from foreign concerns, and that these shows are increasingly active," the Nigerian researchers eases Kunle Amuwo.
In these last few months, these "assistance" has become increasingly evident in its course, the speeches and the operational modes of Boko Harem, now on the arrival of suicide bombers and the use of always complex explosives, which bear the same hallmarks as those used by Aqmi.
The international community in Washington, has since exerted pressure on Abuja, so for the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have deemed the grouping, in fact, for a long time as a community of Illuminaten no special attention must be paid.
Rapid success
In Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf founded Boko Haram - Haoussa means "Western education is a disgrace," the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria in 2002.
The merger, rapid successes in this destitute region.
They are politicized and claiming strict observance of Sharia law, while their connected activists in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists have first churches, bars and authorities in the sights.
In 2009, the defenders of Boko Haram, with its increased attacks against the stations particularly active.
The reaction from Abuja, however, is, as usual, indifferenziert.
The army surrounded the city, it has 800 deaths.
The perceived in captivity, Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is increasingly radical and leaves their strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, known to an attack in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is allocated to the guilt of Selbstmordattentates, secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations to priority international targets.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, worried since all security experts.
While the Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger, the Somalis of al-Shabaab operating in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, hatta Alain Juppé during a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria warned against Boko Harem and shown a willingness to "all the evidence."
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry competing in simplification and lack of knowledge about China, Iraq and support for Israel.
A crisis weakened America can be a complex world with simple, not to say: silly ideas?
If the Republican presidential candidates, listening to the voters could almost get that impression.
For some days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and her companions thundering declarations and statements on foreign policy, traditional Republican focus, consistently reported.
On China, Iran and Israel aid - often based in any way - slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" the highest in the forthcoming rate Mitt Romney threatened to cite the Chinese before the WTO, and it is the "currency manipulation" - leading issue in America, by the exodus of entire industries to Asia irritating prickly - to accuse.
Stupid, if this is to imply the introduction of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama, and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost about his emotion flatter management strangled.
He had a firm hand, but called for constructive talks with Beijing (also Obama's current position).
But Huntsman is not heeded, as it has stagnated in the depths of the opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney also had praised military strikes against Iran if sanctions fail to halting the nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I commands Iran," he had tinted.
"Obama will be re-elected, they get the bomb."
He has also strengthened Israel promised military aid and accused Obama remained to be partners with obligations.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest-ranked candidate, for its part, has a shameful acts of ignorance.
He recently called on to give the Chinese military threat counterproductive to develop since Beijing, "a nuclear power" - and seemed to let the fact that China is already since 1964 in possession of military Atomar arms!
The Texas Governor Rick Perry supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, for its part, to be ready to take the American army in Mexico against drug cartels in service.
The 2009 Obama forbade recourse to torture measures against alleged terrorists was also by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
It is a far cry from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a foreign policy heavyweight.
The current presidential opponent, Reagan also have had simple ideas and despite the Cold War.
They had to call in memory, that Obama selbstein amateur and water in his wine, which was the subject of anti-terrorism.
They are insisting on the right to the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, he is also the reputation of the weakness.
This harassment, however, is not quite as it pleases.

Nord Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs at the bottom of the Baltic Sea and the western Europe connects directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Russia's Gazprom Gasriese wanted to celebrate this event with great pomp and ceremony.
More than 500 charged guests, including four heads of state and government have attended last Tuesday on the Baltic coast under Orchesterbeschallung and gourmet buffet the inauguration of the new gas pipeline Nord Stream, Russia and Germany directly below sea level.
The Angelika German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have jointly symbolic tax turned the valves, which Russian gas is transported into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline to 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year through an initial pipeline of 1224 km, which connects the region of St. Petersburg in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, will be delivered to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, which is a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - allowing completed at the end of 2012.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline hinted on themselves.
For Gazprom, the timely and accurate point completion of this enormous framework to provide as a victory.
The project was strongly contested in Poland and the Baltic states.
The Nord Stream pipeline will allow a direct gas supply to Germany and avoid any track progress by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) in the country.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little bit of their power: it will now be more difficult for them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close down access to western European markets.
Warsaw, most involved in the debate was not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream pipeline with a new Franco-German sowietischen pact " in connection to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has won the endorsement of this Russian project, a higher security of supply.
It has, however, at the expense of enfeeblement of European energy, since the project was a rift between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has brought in barely five years, his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, the strong Gasverbrauche and its gas reserves are running out.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us to organic way," François Fillon confirmed during the inauguration of the pipeline, he pointed out in the extent to which the major contracts are important political and economic side.
All of this explains the broad smile in Lubmin number of Gazprom's managers in terms of Gaszuleitung.
The construction of this pipeline is also a prominent technology.
The underwater pipeline consists of steel with concrete shelter they protect against ship berth.
It rests on the seabed, about 200 metres in depth.
Its construction had to be avoided from the Second World War previous minefields.
"Hundreds of mines, for example, had to be a precaution, removed or destroyed," Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream.
In addition to enhanced measures will be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The management is a long queue of metal as 242 Eiffel towers over the entire length is interrupted by nothing: neither valves, maintenance stations.
A control platform was taken off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders have refrained because Sweden were hardly eager to see a Russian state company in a permanent way to its shores.
"In the event of an accident, we close the Gasdurchlass in less than a minute," Jens Müller clarified.
Escape in the event of a leak in the pipeline, so depressed gas into the air.
This case will probably be considered by the designers, however, because the proximity of sweat, estimated at a consistency from a leak per 100000 years.
The state surveillance of the pipeline will be guaranteed by an underwater-robot, controlled by a ship from external virtue purposes, as well as a device which circulates inside the pipeline.
It has the form of a cigar, a metre diameter, will be introduced into the pipeline and moved by the pressure.
After three full days of the movement by the leadership at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device when it arrives very specific information about possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years, without the slightest repairs need to be assessed.
The Gaszirkulation will simply pressure.
This 200 cash to the access, 100 cash to the exit.
Five companies have united their forces on the implementation of this project.
The senior leadership, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies incorporated E. ON and BASF (to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and French firms group GDF Suez (to 9%).
These five companies have formed a business community called Nord Stream and entrusted with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug in Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has this society hired out the entire capacity of its gas, and renewable 20-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity, no matter how great the real transporting a quantity of gas," Jens Müller clarified.
The financing of the Gasfernleitungsbaus to 30% of shareholders and 70% covered by bank loans.
The total labour costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
The total investment, for example, 240 million for GDF Suez.
The minority shareholders are, however, certainly, to recoup their expenses because Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The pipeline is a sandy, pine-forested coastal strip in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5-meter-high valves are Gasaustrittspforte.
Sensors to measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of arriving gas before this passed in the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal with a million cubic metres of Russian gas per hour pass.
At full capacity, it would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a Markennotizbuch.
By an Italian company about 15 years, Moleskine now want to give the letter new style.
It has a flair for adventure, by candlelight, with the letter spent hours.
The book notice of Moleskine is easily recognizable with his black, right square cover his elastic, eierschalfarbenen pages, such as aged over time.
The Moleskine note book, as we know it today, however, is created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, decided to bring a distinguished Designnotizbuch on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, specialist adviser of the company, is charged with the market introduction of the new product.
The note book was inspired by a traditional production technology, called Mole skinhead (mole skin), which described a Baumwollack, for example, will be used for salary padded benches.
This type of book notice was among writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has an old and almost forgotten subject rekindle the icon pioneering artists was," explained Maria Sebregondi, now brands in Modo Modo until the 20th century.
The success of advocates.
Between 2006 and 2010, the sales increase by 26% and establish a sales of 12.7 million.
This is a far cry from the usual production in the first years of only 3000 notebooks were conceived.
Moleskine happens to the Italian border, and will be carried out in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to produce a phantom image of the buyer, because the book notice as businessmen, as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has more cosmopolitan image, cultured and intellectual customers.
The small Italian companies, 12 workers in its infancy, now employs more than 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; in Milan, the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookshops, Internet portals such as Fnac, in the town of small boutique centres and understands its identity.
"We have followed the spirit and his new paperwork requirements, despite the recovery of the e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural Charakterzug is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently, the brand exposure, called "Detour (detour) " launched in the architects and artists to issue their own notebooks.
In August, the company at the film festival in Locarno also cover with the leopard pattern on the market.
Moleskine benefited from his success and cultural zeitgeist and showed it to diversify its products: pockets, calendar, pen computers remain... The brand, the entire range of articles.
A success, Neider on the plan: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and proposed a new chapter in the history of the Moleskine company.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers in such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people in search of a job.
Today begins the 15th week of work for disabled people. "
Despite a purposeful public policy, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate is always disabled people twice as high as the average value: 19% against Arbeitlosigkeit 9% of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No, Éric stressed Blanchet, Director-General of the Association of Adapt, the organiser of the week's work for the disabled."
"Within 15 years of progress."
"The unemployment rate was not twice, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, there is still an enormous amount of work to do."
However, it must be said that, for disabled unemployed continues, there are many obstacles before they get a job.
More often it is the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no baccalaureate and there are only 10000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with qualifications.
Finally, the long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of the disabled persons to 38% in the overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria, a fresh start working, and the "heart of the problem," Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, a 1992 association set up to recruit businesses to help disabled workers.
So much for the brakes.
The underlying implication, mentalities, certainly, but slowly.
A weak note in April by the Association of IMS-Entre prendre for the magazine La Cité study gave the surveyed managers have " a level of disabled people, " which was " represented " by people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually less well-off. "
The result is that private companies with more than 20 people still have a long way to go before the employment target of 6% disabled people employed in a 1987 law was written.
The latter, originating from the 2008 figures point to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at 3%," reported Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organisation, which is mandated to raise contributions from companies that this law.
The proof: "pay fees" plants has been reduced as well as the amount of contributions between 2007 and 2011, and numbers of 59000 to 46000 (606 to 480 million euros).
"The law of 2005, which increases, created a strong pressure on the company, said Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also brings a real insight, particularly in the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry for work only 59% of plants between 20 and 49, disabled staff employed, companies with 100-199 staff against 82%.
Hazard: " what a lucky '
Even before they had the blue Tuesday evenings (20: 45.00 p.m.), the cheek, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens her pleasure, the game of friendship, not concealed.
It would be too wide to claim that there had been a covert agreement between them, but the picture is symbolic volumes.
Side by side on the podium, viewers of the Stade de France have been working out George Leekens and Eden Hazard well close to peace.
Five months after the spirited gesture of his player attack against Turkey, the Belgian national coach, had nothing but praise about his person.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I would like to look forward," the native Liller turn.
The contrast between his presentation in the club and Nationalelf "it is a unity that justifies everything."
"In Lille, I am over the whole year, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It is time for me to go to the start."
Hazard will come after Saint-Denis, brought Friday evening against Romania in terms of Matchs against France in order to "shine."
But without the note to refrain from "pleasure."
The French national team, he is shooting since the age of seven years, he led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he acknowledged.
This inevitably helps to strengthen the "unique" nature of this meeting.
So much in advance, "Mathieu Debuchy (), Yohan Cabaye () and Adil Rami () will be," he quoted.
"We have just gone on the road."
"To play against them means lucky!"
Leekens deported with Gutmütigkeit hinted "proud."
"The pride, a gala match."
"Pride" - in his capacity as "neighbours" - to confirm that France "has become a team at a very high level" and little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a good job doomed," he said.
Although Belgium is lacking in the next European Championship, the technician looks very well share the plane with the blue (the French Nationalelf)... and the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We are small Belgians large," he stressed.
"We are planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"They will be included in the upcoming Games say." The game against France.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team by Paulo Bento looks with great optimism the return match against Bosnia (22: 00) in Lisbon on Tuesday.
The Hinspiel had both teams lacked objectivity.
"We will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country at the end of the 90 minutes."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt, "la Selecçao" his Nationalelf, for which he was responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the European Championship in 2012.
This is, in fact, only 90 minutes of honeymoon for Portugal.
But there is a match to play, and abzuservieren an opponent, and Bosnia.
In view of the Hinspiels (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems clear that the die has not yet been taken.
Portugal dominated for more than an hour of the game, but the team was not able to cause such important mark on the pressure from her.
"It is a good result, but it carries a certain risk, because we have made no Auswärtstor."
At home, however, in their bright shine Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced before an audience, which is likely to be hot on the game through, even if the game, of course, as a "very short, it was announced," said the optimistic, however, lucid Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but they are completely convinced, to be able to gain the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of Euro 2012 to be" watered down, however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia, forcing the Portuguese, and a gateway to win.
A draw the Bosnians, who also needed a goal already.
"It is a good result, but it carries a certain risk, because we have made no Auswärtstor" Bento.
"We will compete against a team that has the high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese, already beginning to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians, "they admit no time for reflection."
A good idea, provided that they will put into practice.
