The lack of snow in the mountains worries the hotel
Not alone to the maintainers of ski lifts in Krkonose are them worrying the tracks without snow.
The lack of snow makes the people not reserve stays of ski in hotels and pensions.
That's why, in Krkonose rooms free can still be obtained for all the winter dates, inclusively for Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have many visitors on our pages.
The people look the offers, checks the prices, but still has fear to reserve with commitment.
And if they call us, they ask immediately on our opinion, if this Christmas there will be snow or mud, "mentioned the maintainer of the informative doorway Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those that want to pass a New Year's Eve according to their expectations in Špindlerv Mlýn, should not doubt more to reserve the stay.
Those that prefer saving the money and put the quality of housing in second place, can try to wait for a few more days.
The hotel managers of Špindlerv Mlýn offer especially weekly stays for Nochevieja.
I think that they will keep offering them, but they will soon yield and will offer shorter stays.
And afterwards the free will be sold rooms will be sold quickly, estimated Jandura.
Ingotours a travel agency in, keeps offering free beds for all the dates of winter.
Now what interests us more is the Christmas week, which it is not complete yet.
Half of the offered posts is still free.
That's why we have already prepared some Christmas stays of last time, " mentioned the director of.
The travel agency in can still offer also offer the eve on, but there are fewer places free.
They are sold very well the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are bandaged regular.
This year the interest stays in the winter is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonose.
The people are waiting to see whether there will be snow.
Nobody wants to pass the end of the year in the mountains without Snow.
If the avenues remain snowstorms during the week, the dates of will also be used up," gives an opinion Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms in the hotel Horizont in Pec pod Snkou; last year it was more difficult.
We are approximately five per cent better.
For new year's eve and the, we have the last free seats.
The interest increases during Polish during the holidays increases in January and February is also sold well," informed the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty per cent of the new year's eve stays is already Omnia occupied also in the hotel, near the central parking in Janské Lázn.
On the contrary, in the most recent hotel of Janské Lázn in Christmas half of the beds is still free.
This January it was a great surprise for us, since we find each other approximately at sixty per cent of the ability of occupation.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, the interest in stays in will probably increase, mentioned Erik Sporysch, the director of the hotel.
However, it at the moment seems that to the hotel of feel the snow will be passed to them waiting.
On The Thursday the temperatures must fall and, if there are rainfall, in the mountains it should snow.
But afterwards of new they will go up the temperatures, informed Jií Jakubský de Hradec Králové, of the Institute Hidrometeorológico of the Czech Republic.
USA.: The repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of man more intelligent, as a pupil diligent repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of its predecessor, who he himself took for the most foolish.
When finally it revealed its Afghan approach, expected with forward, it was proved that it is a copy of the hyphen used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text the right is used several times "in the same way that in Iraq", but it did not hesitate either about using the bond of the declaration of Bush of January 2007 for their own statement: a new way forward.
He himself was, the one who three years ago criticized the idea about Bush of sending new military forces to Iraq, the country that is suffering by the civil war. And that criticized it as an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, they however proved that the strategy of Bush, based on the recommendations of captains of field, was the only possible and successful one, so today nothing of Iraq is spoken in the news.
The reputation of did not improve, however objectively left to its successor a much more favorable initial situation of what one might have waited.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to be repeated.
The captains of field asked it again that it increased the military contingent, especially the commander in commander-in-chief of the general Afghan operation Stanley McCristal. He, even in spite of the traditional subordinate relations, subdued the undecided riflemen in the White House to a criticism hard.
He asked 40 000 men to be able to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but nothing occurred to him better, so at least it tricked the general on 10 000 military.
It managed to get Europe to promise it another 5.000, although it himself previously had with at least 10.000.
The most problematic thing of all the whole strategy of seems its objective, to start to withdraw to the troops of in 18 months and to finish this procedure in three years. all the whole doctrine of generated more questions of the answers that it offered.
Many doubt that the increase gives the same result as the procedure in.
In spite of the fratricidal wars in recent years, the society of Iraq is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in is different: it is not possible to trust anybody and any agreement is complied.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare Afghan forces of security at the Afghan forces, if they are gotten used to changing the head every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will keep being just a Potemkin village. After it will remain patriarchal tribal relations.
To balance the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to the confusing relations, still more complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even to establish a state that is "capable of action", a minimum goal of the whole operation, seems very real.
The horizon of the strategy of is startling for her proactive approach.
During the last eight years the situation in has kept worsening and now is about to explode.
Alone one romantic soul, which does not know anything of the reality, can think that the soldiers sent to the war so that "they go back soon home", will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, to fix the date of the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, since the Taliban will consider it as indirect as a statement of the American defeat.
The recent NATO summit proved that the Europeans have less and less will of taking part in military operations in.
European politicians do not know, and they do not want to explain to their electorate, what relationship has the safety of Germany or Italy with the war with the, either.
The other factor, capable of affecting the situation radically, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation keeps worsening and the increased sanctions do not exert any effect on the Iranians, the USA. will have to take a difficult decision: trying to solve the problem by military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America initiates the triumphal withdrawal of the troops in.
However each solution will mean a setback dramatic for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for is the fact that they are lacking three years for the presidential elections and that's why it still remains a lot of time to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs will not receive the ready bonuses again
The tall executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will not receive this year the ready bonuses.
The announced this entity announced it to react before the hard criticism of their practices of salary.
The group of 30 tall managers will receive, instead of money, actions that will not be able to be sold in a minimum period of five years.
Besides, the actions will be able to be withdrawn in the case that they had assumed excessive risks.
According to the agency, Goldman Sachs became like this the leader in the effort of joining the bonuses in Wall Street to the power in the long term.
I mean that Wall Street is completely conscious of the longest path that must start, mentioned the ex bank investor of the body Douglas Elliott.
The devil is in the detail, added.
The bank confronted the criticism after having put almost 17.000 million dollars (almost 300 000 million) aside for the bonuses, in the first three months of this year.
The total addition of the bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the agency, probably surpasses, in spite of the measure announced today the 20, 000 million dollars.
The high bonuses in the banking sector were converted, with the arrival of the financial crisis, in a sensitive subject in the policy.
Great Britain announced the Wednesday that plans to tax of a single time, with a tax of fifty per cent, the bonuses for bancarios that they surpass the 25.000 pounds (approximately 712.000 CZK).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year the women received the Prizes Nobel in all categories less Physical
Five women, what is a record amount record, the Prizes Nobel of this year received today in Stockholm of hands of King Gustavo of Sweden, in specialized categories and in literature.
Besides the four scientific, also a German writer of Romanian origin, appeared among the awarded ones.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, thus as its compatriot Jack Szostak by the research in the area of the chromosomes, received the Prize Nobel of medicine.
The received the Nobel chemical in received it the Israeli and the Americans and Thomas Steitz for the explanation of the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The last prize, delivered US the and its compatriot Oliver Williamson by the analysis of economic report received the last prize.
The only specialized category, without an awarded woman, was Physical.
The scientists Charles Kao by the research in the area of the optical cables, and George Smith received today this prize with Willard Boyle for the invention of the chip CCD, which constitutes the base of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Every awarded collected diploma, received the, the coin and the certificate of the received money.
This sum in each category is of a million kronas up to ten (approximately 25 million Czech crowns).
In the case of there being several awarded ones in each category, they distribute the prize among themselves.
The traditionally more expected Nobel, that of the Peace, received it today in the afternoon in Oslo, Norway, the US President.
In his speech it recognized the controversy of having been awarded, since it is found at the beginning of his career and besides is at the head of a country that takes part in two wars: in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
To defend its policy it added, however, that in certain situations the wars are essential to obtain the peace, even if its price is high.
The minister considers the resignation. Klaus invited it to the Castle
The President will receive on the Friday in the morning to the minister of exchequer Eduard Janota, which its remaining in the government is being posed, since it does not agree with the version of the state budget for the year that comes, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is meant that the budget, and maybe also the permanence of Janota in the cabinet, will be the subjects of its meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to it the deficit is too big, which keeps deepening the crisis in public finances.
On the appointment the spokesman informed Radim Ochvat about of the President.
On its remaining in the role, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister.
According to the law on the budget, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit from 163.000 million crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the proposals of the left for transfers of funds and increased the money for the salaries of officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social democrats, since coveredly do to increase the presupuestal deficit.
Among the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and right on the other a serious conflict of internal policy took place. Due to this conflict, people start to debate about the future activities of the bureaucratic cabinet of Fischer, whose form was agreed on in spring for the ODS, SSD and the Green Party.
The reviewers state that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the packet of thrifty measures, imposed in autumn by the government of to stop the public debt.
Klaus can but it does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he declared during breakfast with employers that the politicians took a lot of time "the not sustainable deficit" from public finances neglecting "the severe problem", that is.
According to it today any longer they do not have a good solution.
Only one strong government, which can be based on a broader consensus between the political parties, could improve this situation, the president gives an opinion.
The leader of ODS Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is dreadful and that the government should think its future existence.
The vice-president of ODS, Petr Neas, said for TK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of, ODS and the Greens evidently any longer it does not work.
The Prime Minister reacted and qualified similar words of "strong sentences".
The head of SSD, Jií Paroubek, reacted in front of Topolánek, preparation for this year for ex government of Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit is dreadful. It will surpass the 200 000 million kroner.
On Wednesday SSD said that the approval of the state budget for the year that he comes was successful.
The popular ones were also happy.
Mandela in the new film of Clint Eastwood, interpreted by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans state that the new film of Hollywood, Invictus: Invincible, relates a lot on the country, their fight and its victories, although some criticisms say that the leading roles leading have them American players.
The history talks about the sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in the South African Republic and its first black President, is interpreted in your biography by the winning American actor of a Óscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, of 91 years, asked him to interpret him in the film.
Matt Damon redeems Another important role.
I told to him: "When he interprets him, I will have to have access to you.
The actor of seventy and two years, which received the prize for its paper in the drama of Eastwood on the world of the boxing Milion Dollar Baby, it had the paper of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, that it ended up being a slave, of the fictitious president of the US., and even of God in Evan Todopoderoso. But rarely he represented somebody who still is still alive and, for many people, who is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman passed 27 years in prison for its activities to put an end to apartheid in the Republic of South Africa.
It was released in 1990 and for four years converted in president of the country.
In 1993 it received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the bond of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk as it
The film is a real story on Nelson Mandela, who joined its forces with the captain of the equipment of South African rugby, Francois Pienaar, to help join the country. the new president, knows that after the apartheid its nation keeps being racial and economically divided up.
He thinks that it is capable of uniting its people through the sport, and that's why he decides to unite the rugby players, who belong in the world to measure to the marginalised.
The South African team manages to arrive at the Glass of World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years so that the history of arrived to the cinemas.
It did not have another goal to have this role in such a way that it was as similar as possible to the reality, said Freeman.
Naturally the greatest challenge was to talk as it.
The player said that if it and the world political you were of the same area, had tried to be brought together with Mandela, to dine with it, to be among behind the scenes before your speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake hands with Mandela.
I discovered that when tightening it the hand, I receive your energy, this is transmitted and had the sensation of knowing how you feel, said.
For me it is important to try to convert me into a different person.
Matt Damon redeems the paper of François Pienaar, the captain of the national team, rugby, in which white players predominated.
The said player made out that he had six months to be prepared for a paper in the hard rugby world.
A great surprise for it was, when finally he met for the first time with Pienaar in its home.
I remember to have called to the door, it opened and the first thing that I told it to François Pienaar in my life was: "In the film I seem much taller".
In spite of the obvious differences between the characters of actors and their real models, and under the management of the director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and is spoken also of ambitions for the Óscar.
The reviewer of cinema of the magazine McCarthy summarized its assessment with these words: It "was a very good history, a film very well done."
In the reviews of films on website page rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 per cent of positive assessments.
The secret of the solved splendor on Norway: the Russians made proofs of a missile
On Norway a special bright effect of unknown origin was observed.
The Ministry of defence of ended up recognizing yesterday that near the border with he made an intercontinental ballistic missile testing.
The launch failed again. The missile, of type " Bulava ", previously destined to be the pride of the Russian army, is turning into the nightmare of the Russian generals and of Prime Minister.
Not even its repeated presence in the presence of the missile tests has had the desired effect in the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in most of the cases, did not go out flying or a fault took place in the air.
In the Russian newspapers they write of " Bulavá " as of a missile that it" does not " fly ".
A missile that does not fly, but shines.
During this the thirteenth test no problem took place at first.
At the end of the flight technical problems took place again in the apparatus.
Probably the engine exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time " Bulavá " it was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes the launch possible from a vessel that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
That's why it is probable that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an object wheel not identified, was in fact the unsuccessful " Bulavá ".
The Norwegians in the same way from the first moment did not hesitate that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves stating that people can not talk simply about a failure.
The first two stages of the missile they lasted and the breakdown took place in the third.
In the previous cases the engines broke down immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the firing completely passed off without errors, according to the management of the Ministry of defence only six of the thirteen were unsuccessful.
The success of almost fifty per cent full of optimism to the general and that's why they keep stating that " Bulavá " a day will fly troublefree and that even it will manage to take nuclear hypersonic blocks up to ten, whose total weight maximum is of 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary signed at 51 years an annual contract with CSKA of Moscow
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will present himself again at the 51 years to a meeting of professional hockey.
The world champion, the former, olympic and winning champion of the Stanley Glass will help to your team Moscow and possibly will play on Friday in the duel of KHL against San Petersburgo.
Fetisov finished its professional career at forty years of age in 1998 and at present presides over the CSKA.
That Denis Kulyash was wounded, we need urgently another defender.
Fetisov practices constantly and has committed itself to helping the team.
We only have to solve certain formal issues, the agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the club of.
It is not clear yet if the return of the famous player will refer to a single party.
I think that Fetisov is one of those that manage to lift the encouragement of the other players, mentioned Nemchinov.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the lines of ice, will convert in the most long-lived professional player of Russian hockey.
The front legendary one Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at fifty-one years, during whole season during the, of age and achieved goals, and achieved 15 and 26 members present.

The address of the factory of cars in Nosovice agreed with the trade unions to cancel all the extra work.
Precisely by the frequent extra work the trade unions declared on Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vank, the spokesman of the factory of automoviles Hyundai.
Agree to, however wants for this year to agree with the trade unions on a question with the unions of Saturday more.
We can not hand over to our plan of manufacture, since it is essential. that's why we suggested voluntary supplementary work for the Saturday 19 December, that is, will be worked in two sessions, said Vank.
According to the servant Sedmika.cz the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who work the question on Saturday.
The bonus will be paid also for the last Saturday, the 28th of November.

The employees can charge the bonus for overtime or can take a day off on 28 of December, that is, to prolong on a day the Christmas holidays, mentioned Vank.
Besides, all the employees of shifts of Saturday will receive money by the journey and for the food.
Because the extra work was the most urgent and most problematic point of the comments and complaints of the trade unionists and strikers, who stopped the manufacture last week the direction yesterday in the afternoon decided immediately to cancel all the supplementary work for December, mentioned Vank.
The employees of the car factory were seen obliged of working two hours more besides shifts of eight hours and this situation persisted practically all every day until last week.

Czech a discovery: an effective substance even in the viruses of HIV ' encallecidos '
The team of German and Czech scientists makes proofs of new compounds capable of moderating the spread of in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is effective also against the virus resistant to medicines.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the composed is not so effective in a strategy of the virus, as some already accessible medicines already.
The disease can not heal up until now.
However the lives of patients will be able to go on significantly thanks to a mixture of medicines that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is completely not suppressed, the called resistant virus will be created; against them, the medicines do not work any longer.
The work of the experts of three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, of VŠCHT Prague and of the University of it proves the possibility to dominate the resistance of the virus.
They proved that the substances called metalocarboranos have effect in the albumin, responsible for the propagation of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranos are composed of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way to all the medicines used today, and that's why they can solve the problem of resistance.
In its work the scientists find new, compounds ' improved ', prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of its link to the albumin of the virus.
The metalocarboranos have a three-dimensional only structure: two polyhedron cages composed by the atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon are joined by the atom of metal, in this case by cobalt.
A traitor virus and resilient
The proteasis HIV is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the proteasis of the HIV, the breaking-up of the HIV virus does not take place and corpuscles of the virus would not be created ripe and infectious.
If we stop the proteasis HIV, we stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, explain the scientists in a news of press published by the Institute of organic Chemistry and of biochemistry in the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article of published in the journal of scientific journal Medicinal Chemistry the scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two couples of cages (see the table) are joined by a short organic series, which keeps being modified systematically.
A little weaker, but more effective
The proof of the effect of this series of substances against the proteasis HIV was carried out in graduated cylinder, and also against its resistentes variants, obtained from patients with.
The effect of the metalocarboranos in common in the variant of the enzyme is not its effect as strongly as in the clinically used medicines, they do however not lose in the resistentes variants, in those that the medicines many times do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities as biological and chemical stability, the low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications does, that the metalocarboranos are composed interesting for the research with the aim of suggesting effective medicines against the HIV, says Pavlína ezáová, the head of the laboratory of the structural Biology in the Institute of the organic and biochemical chemistry and of the Institute of the molecular genetica in the Academía of science.
Fighting over the budget. ODS attacked to Fischer, he defends itself
The head of ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the approved budget for the year that he comes is " dreadful " and the government of Prime Minister should think, according to it its future existence.
The statements of were indicated by the prime minister and judgments strong.
They say that he forgets time for the analysis.
The vice-president of ODS Petr Neas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of, ODS and the Green Party does evidently not work any longer.
According to Neas the prime minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to base himself on the minority, which he tries to fight against the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in its post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and the social democración towards the problem of public deficit is completely different, noticed Neas.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the modifying proposals on the part of the left, for more than 12 a billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for the pays of the state civil servants, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government reproached for the proposals of, since coveredly increase the presupuestal deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern a billion crowns with the deficit of 163.
ODS before the vote went out of the chamber and like this complied the desire for the government, which the modified budget is better than a temporary budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
The Minister of Exchequer, Eduard Janota, talked about the disappointment and feeling of disappointment and disillusionment useless; Prime Minister mentioned that the government will value the current situation again.
Neas is convinced of which if Janota would seriously threaten with the resignation in the event of approval of the modifier proposals, the situation had been able to be different.
According to eská televize Janota asked for a meeting with the prime minister.
It indicated, that it is thinking about remaining in the job.
The reason is his disappointment for the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agree with another fight against the presupuestal deficit, according to Neas in the government they do not have anything the nominated to make for the SSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly those that refer to subsidies in disease, income, or to the amendment of the law of service, if he will resign, if the house approve other laws that increase the deficit, for example.
Topolánek: The ministers nominated by the ODS are not responsible
It is the matter of Prime Minister and of all the government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have not done at all bad, underlined Topolánek in the news of text of the USA.
It remembered, that in several ministries in the posts of deputies there are people that belong to the TOP 09, which he voted against the budget.
Neas underlined, that if he Fischer decides to hand the beginning of the fight with the height of the deficit in the public finances over, "it "is absolutely logical and correct, that it leans on the leftist majority, which at present is in the Chamber of Deputies. "
However like this will not be able to have with the support and the tolerance of the members of.
I have not thought on that, when it is the time comes, I will be in charge of that, the Defence Minister told to the journalists in the Chamber of Deputies Martin Barták, who was named for the government by members of precisely.
The Prime Minister went out in the afternoon to a meeting of the European Council in.
ODS yielded at the request of the first minister
Neas underlined, that ODS on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies would probably vote against the budget modified, if the prime minister does not ask explicitly the representatives of ODS that allow the acceptance of the budget.
We do not feel as we, orphans, are not small children, reacted to the question, if ODS does not worry about the absence of the head of the party in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
It did not account for me for my vote being lacking.
When resigning from of the mandate knew, that in the following months they were especially bolchevización of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of all what was positive, Topolánek reacted same.
According to the new schedule of less trains of D less trains will circulate almost for almost the same fee
Eské dráhy (railways Czechs) from 13 of December will cancel or restringuirán some express trains and less used sites and, on the contrary, they will reinforce certain links.
The total extension of traffic will come down to two per cent in comparison with today, that the new timetable of trains comes into effect.
Most of the fees including the basic price and of customer it will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will gain for example the inhabitants of the region of, dráhy for this line will add unacarretería pendolino.
On the contrary The direct train will not circulate to Bratislava again.
In the Prague line - Písek - eské Budjovice will circulate less fast trains, itself restringuirán the direct links Prague - Letohrad.
In the regions, the biggest reduction of the transport planned by dráhy is in the region of, eight per cent in total, on the contrary, the transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
Will be canceled also two nocturnal trains in the Prague trace - Tábor - eské Budjovice and some express trains in the Prague line - Písek - eské Budjovice will come down only at few days of the week.
One of the greatest changes is the introduction of a new hot line of Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of have to change into Lysá nad Labem.
It is about the 15. line of the 15 system, in around our cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line of nad Labem to Milovice.
The links at long distances to the capital will finish Hlavní nádraí in the Prague station.
D will introduce more links SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to will circulate every two hours.
From the 13th of December the travellers will not travel to Bratislava in Pendolino again.
The account for the regional train ones of this year: 200 million this year more that before
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of transport, to cover the called provable leaks Dráhy will receive the year that comes four billion crowns in total, in the same way that this year. The local trains are ordered through the regions, next year they will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For the express trains and dráhy sites they have a new contract of ten years, until now the contract was always of a year.
Dráhy are happy with the system, and maybe that's why they did not increase the prices of a great majority of the tickets.
The changes will be produced only in the notes of one day - D Net and in the cheap notes of internet eLiska.
For travellers without card of customer the price Net will increase of 450 crowns at sek 600.
The price of will depend on the distance, until now there was the single price of 160 kroner for travel among any two regional cities.
Filipinos armed they keep stopping more than 50 people, the children were released

Janura will lodge a complaint by slur to three hetmánes of SSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Janura will today lodge a complaint for calumny to three social democratic hetmánes.
They are in the region Jihomoravský kraj, Radko Martínek de Pardubický kraj and the hetmán of Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesaík.
Janura mentioned it in Veinte minutes in Radiournál.
The demand has to see with the effort of the company, to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions however ended up signing contracts to I release it deadline with eské dráhy.
All the three hetmánes are attacking us and talk about the fact that "we are taking the pasas of the cake", however we brought only supply for what they themselves wanted.
They state, that we are more expensive than eské dráhy, what is not true. We know the prices of eské dráhy, which was fixed last week.
So we do not have another thing to defend us, which.
It is for the calumny towards the society Student Agency, said for Radiournál Janura.
It mentioned at the same time to have the proofs of all of the regions. According to it there are not measures necessary taken in harmony with European law.
That's why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hasek considers Janura, which acts as free publicity for his firm and for it, this complaint for the continuation of the medial show of Mr.
Naturally I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and appeal to the other hetmánes that make it also.
I mean, that also on this occasion it will be proved clearly, that Mr. Janura manipulates the public in the matter of regional transport, rail, and it uses lying and false arguments, mentioned Hasek.

The neumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The neumococal vaccine from January will put an end to the habits usual.
As first vaccine voluntary must be free for families and at the same time.
However opinions, that the compulsory vaccine would be more effective, already appear.
The preliminaries for the introduction of the free vaccine against neumococos culminate.
The Institute of Medicines is already fixing the maximum prices of the vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
The experts also already have it clear in the procedure of vaccination.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for the children born in August
From January the children born since the 2nd of August of last year will be able to receive freely the neumococal vaccine.
The condition is not to have received a dose of the vaccine before.
The who started with the vaccine last year or before, they have to cover other dose of vaccine also.
The first dose of vaccination has to be received among the third and the fifth between the third month of old of child.
Last year the fourth part of the families let voluntarily vaccinate their children against neumococos.
The fathers however paid 1600 kroner and more for a dose.
To vaccinate smaller children four doses are needed.
Generally the experts estimate, that insurance companies will use up sek 300 to 450 000 in the vaccines of 300 to 450 annually.
Without I engage the clutch will save in the treatment, which is needed for the not vaccinated children.
Until now the state used up by all the vaccination of children approximately 500 a thousand annually.
The covered vaccination was initiated by the called package of.
The neumococo is the cause of the otitis media, but also of the serious infections inclusively the meningitis and the septicemia.
Of the infections neumococales in our country every year die according to the investigations in the hospitals 28 not old children of the 10 years of age.
Besides the Czech Republic the neumócocal vaccine cover in the children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be obligatory?
However opinions, which this vaccine could be obligatory in future, appear at the same time.
From January it must be covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
The compulsory vaccine would be better, indicated for example Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civic association Nahlas.
Its partnership already propagates the neumococales vaccines since long ago.
The experts in an international conference, which our partnership took in part, were not completely satisfechoscon the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It is not completely ideal.
On the other hand we are happy, if it manages to obtain at least this.
I think that this is the path that now we have to start, mentioned Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health does however not want to change the procedure of vaccination against neumococos.
Now we do not think it at all, said its spokesman.
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, state the doctors
The president of the society of pediatricians Odborná spolenost praktických dtských léka Hana Cabrnochová recognizes, that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children would receive the vaccine, it will be able to be reasoned on the reduction of the number of the dose. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs a relatively high amount, relatively we understand the political decision of having initiated vaccination as a voluntary, " says Cabrnochová.
The experts wait, that from the year that comes more than 80 porciento of young parents leaves to vaccinate their babies against neumococos.
The neumococal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children it is covered by the companies of health, not for the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money in the prophylaxis, to save afterwards in the treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
The doctors will have to buy the vaccines by themselves.
However concerned about are worried about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, the vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to the doctors, in the same way as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some members however had fear, that insurance companies could "draw the money of health insurance ".
The doctors because of that will have to buy the vaccines and expect them, even to be paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated, that the pediatricians will invest in the vaccines 40 a thousand at the month, what is a significant sum.
It will not be at all easy, says Cabrnochová.
Still them and us
Can the Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time in which the Swiss voters have requested that the construction of minarets be forbidden and in that it exists an alert generalized on the supposed Islamization of Europe, John Bowen an American academic, has written a report detailed and studied on the possible integration of the Muslims (which in fact are being integrated) in one of secular societies more openly of the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as fans of the last work of the author "Why the Frenchmen do not like them the veils (Why the French Don't Like Headcarves") (2006), a study elegant and in a detailed way put forward of a problem that divided up and worried the country during a decade and half, and whose effects are perceived still today.
The last book of Mr. Bowen has a broader perspective and more ambitious.
As good anthropologist, wants to know not only what the politicians and the means on the Islam in France, but what really is happening are saying.
He has passed months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims of with what Mr. Bowen names "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students on the questions that interest them more.
Should a Muslim get married in a mosque or in a town council (or both of them)?
Should they show them young Muslims on the evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a Muslim man not?
Is it legitimate that a Muslim uses a banking system based on interests to obtain a mortgage?
These issues are in an apparent way mundane, sustains, things of daily life, those that worry the means more than the political drama.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, no of them famous, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadán, an academic and erudite Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate about how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not manage completely to spread this argument.
The conservatives doubt so alone of the idea about a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr. Bowen interviews tend to be in disagreement with its counterparts of Salafi, partisans of the associated purist Sunni Islam with Saudi Arabia, who at present have a small but influential presence among Muslims in.
Bowen thinks that the Muslim values and the French laicism could be compatible.
But the adjustment requires mutual concessions.
It questions up to what extent the French political strategists (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends the laicism) are really committed themselves with the pluralism.
He suggests that the Muslims probably have a deal more unfair than the Catholics, protestant and Jewish, that have also had to do its historical commitments with the secular republicanism.
More that a growing pragmatism, perceives "an adjustment of values".
Can the Islam be French? After reading this book, one lays out to say "Yes, but still not."
The most devastating picture in the World
The Arctic is changing more quickly and in more dramatic than any other habitat of the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with themselves the life that can not survive on any other side.
By the interests of oil, the gas, the trasporte and the fishing lawyers have been focused in waters recently opened, with diplomats, and now authors, as consequence of this.
In "thin ice Envelope" ("On Thin Ice") Richard Ellis, a writer and enlightening, paints a natural history of the ícono of the north the polar bear.
Connoisseur of the complicated history and of the policy of the hunt of whaling, describes the long tradition of the explorers of the Arctic, which valuable proofs gave facing the white bear.
The meeting of the admiral Nelson as a brave cadet of 14 years, fighting only with the end of its musket, is probably a myth, but others are true.
The baby animals, captured while they swam following the bodies of its newly exterminated mothers, were caught and zoological and circuses were sent.
A presentation of circus at the beginning of the 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even at present, the enclosures of the zoological ones are still generally a one millionth part of the area of the field of an adult savage. The climate is almost never adapted: a polar bear resident in put on green for the algae that grow in the areas without hairs of its stripe.

Ellis recurs to stories of other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that the hunters present to the survival of the species.
Although it is prohibited in Norway, USA. and Russia, the slaughter continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and the Eskimo Indians in snowmobiles use assault rifles of high power to bring down their high power dams.
Ironically, it is in the waters towards the north of those two nations jackets where the ice will last for more time.
In its new book, "after the ice" ("After the Ice ") , Alun Anderson a former editor of, offers a clear and bloodcurdling story on the science of the and a moving look of how it can transform the future of the place.
It is not that the scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmospheric scientists nor the oceanographers can explain the speed of developments adequately.
It is not for lack of effort.
The pioneer journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th century and beginnings of the 20th century gave evidence for the first time about the displacements of the masses of ice.
Afterwards the submarines in the Cold War drew a map of the shifting tags of ice that circulate under the ice.
The explorations for satellite and the large series of probes assembled in the icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistentes individuals camped in still carried out in the cold carry out many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks in the extraordinary one, diminutive world of the flowing system in the arctic ice, formed by chorritos of saline water that compresses while it freezes.
But from the bear in the surface up to the microscopic marvels of the interior, all are condemned once the ice of summer is withdrawn, what is created can happen in somewhere between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... we could be these we
You marinate kroner in the graves of among the 6.000 that they place
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, of 19 years, traveled seven hours in bus to place a single krona in the tomb of a soldier that he had never known.
For it and the other Marines that traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to the National Cemetery of Arlington to decorate graves, was a day to pay to men and women that once were standing in their own nests.
In a few months, from where they are embarking us, we these could be we, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we are we, I would want for somebody to do the same for me, therefore I only try to show respect.
It was one of more than 6.000 volunteers that were brought together on Saturday in the morning to place crowns in the tombs of the veterans in several sections of the Cemetery of Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Company of Crowns Worcester in Harrington, Maine, gave opened the event when it and other people decided to decorate several hundreds of graves in the Cemetery of Arlington.
In what is already a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife they do the journey each year stopping in different cities along the path, to officiate at events dedicated to military and to victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded an organization without ends of non-profit, Wreaths Across America, which the event towards other states has extended.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the tombs of the cemetery of, areas in the, tombs in the National Cemetery of Fayetteville in Arkansas, the Park of the Battery in the city of and in the commemorative place by the Flight 93 of United Airlines in Shanksville, Pensilvania.
For the second year, the Fundación Walmart donated more than 150 000 dollars to buy and to transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years, of Westminster, told Arlington that he did the journey in honor of its husband a military died of career.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was its mode of giving a retribution to those that did sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which the civilians can support our troops, stated.
It is as visiting a tomb of family.
Wrapped in layers of clothing warm, the volunteers walked through the broad fields and hills of the cemetery.
By the volunteers older graves of the First, the Second World War, and the war were directed to graves of Vietnam, because do not receive many visits as the graves new, said the organisers.
The atmosphere was happy while the children played and the couples were taken of the hand, while they took the fresh pine to the sepulchral tombstones.
Every krona move was of a deep green, with a small red link tied in the top.
Near there, the Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained in a virtual way in silence.
The United Service Organizations (Association in favor of the soldier) donated 1.000 crowns to decorate the section, but the atmosphere gloomy wars of the current invaded the area.
The people cried openly, others prayed, and some were supported by the families and friends in others in than in the air.
Some read out loud names sculpted in the stones, while others inclined to see small white and black plaques placed in the mud wetted, for those tablets, for those who have not been completed yet.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who rinsed tears in their eyes in front of the grave of her son.
He handled eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of the artilleryman of marine Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in fighting in July.
Nobody must ever forget why we are free. my son paid because of that, said.
"A lot after my death "I want somebody to remember it."
Cuban official arrested a contractor Cuban official of the American government
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor of the American government that distributed mobile and laptops at the country, stated on Saturday the civil servants of the State Department.
The contractor, who has not been identified yet, works for Development Alternatives Inc, with based in.
The company works in projects for customers as the Agency for international development agency for the and the World Bank.
The consular officers together with the Section of Interests of United States in Havana are looking for entering the person under arrest, who was arrested on the 5th of December.
The specific charges have not been done public, although according to the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor they can be stopped for almost anything that is considered "of danger ".
All the counter-revolutionary named activities, which include minor protests and critical written, entail the risk of arrest.
The graffiti anti government and the speeches are considered serious offences.
Cuba has an incipient blogger community, directed by the people's commentator, that often it writes on as it and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has requested in several occasions license for leaving the country to accept prizes, but the permission has been denied to him.
The arrest of a US contractor can probably provoke tensions between the communist government of the brothers Castro in Cuba and the administration Obama, which has been looking for an approach "to slow pace "to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first in introducing the news of the arrest on Friday at night.
The new American policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes action specific, as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on behalf of the United States.
The mobile and the laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new products and coveted in a country where the average salary of an employee of the government is of 15 dollars per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the law of buying mobile only this year; they are used especially for text messages, since a telephone conversation of 15 minutes would cost the daily wage.
The use of the Internet is limited extremely in the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors of the hotel, and in some establishment of the government, as universities.
The Cubans who want to be connected, often have to give their names to the government.
The access to many web sites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in is unusual.
Glory Berbena official of press in the Section of Interests of United States in Havana, said that most of the handful of American citizens in prison in are among fences for crimes such as trafficking in drugs.
Berbena said that it could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and the arrest are clearly erroneous.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, as distributing mobile distributed free of charge, in Cuba is a crime, José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program of the Americas of the Organisation, said that recently published a hard report on freedoms in, "Castro, same Cuba" called " New ", a reference to the site of Raúl Castro as leader of the country, to replace its unhealthy big brother.
Vivanco said that the accused are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned on a day.
A negative reaction declared that any solution would be political probably, and that the Cuban government often provokes in the United States, exactly when the two countries start to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel a plot to send Afghanistan men
On Saturday the Pakistani authorities neutralized to the supposed brain of a conspiracy to send five men of Virginia of North American troops to kill American troops, declaring that they expect the case to be able to help unravel a large net of terrorist recruiters, who go over the Internet in search of radicalized youngsters.
The investigators said that they were intending a mysterious well-known insurgent figure as Saifullah, who invited men to after discovering that one of them did comments approving terrorist attacks in the place of videos of Internet YouTube.
Saifullah directed to the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in the tribal belt of, that it is a familiar place for to the Qaeda and their terrorist training camps.
But a civil servant of Pakistani intelligence that had been informed about the case, appeared the Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the commanders of to the Qaeda that the men did not belong to a plot of the CIA to infiltrate into the terrorist network.
Therefore, it isolated them for itself during several days in the oriental city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the North West, which have turned into a paradise terrorist.
He considered them for itself as part of a hidden operation.
By this reason they were refused, stated the civil servant, which spoke from the anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The civil servant said that the men were not affected and even were trying to obtain the proper approval to access to the camps of to the Qaeda, when the police arrested the Pakistani authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and they are being questioned by the FBI, underlines the critical paper of the recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and, maybe what is more important, determine those who are of confidence.
From the attacks of the 11 of September 2001 the US intelligence has put as top priority to try to infiltrate people inside of to the Qaeda.
The Organisation recruiting offices acting as the act as guards, not leaving to pass those that do not prove a serious commitment to the holy war, and those that could be spies.
The analysts said that to the Qaeda analyzes with special attention to the aspiring American recruits.
But for the Organisation they represent a huge attractive, due to its potential to have access to American objectives and due to its value of propaganda.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the Foundation NEFA with based in, said that terrorist groups have also turned much more cautious in recent years with regard to those who admit, because the US intelligence agencies have been made expert in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate somebody in these groups, what better way to follow the model of recruitment what so many have already followed? he expressed Kohlmann.
It has transformed into a model based much more on the Web.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, require climatic " action "
On Saturday tens of thousands of demonstrators went here through the streets requiring more bold actions for the climate, from the negotiators who work Beautiful Center of the city in the centre of conventions.
The demonstrators said that 100 000 people took part in the event, but the police estimated that the amount was nearer to 25.000.
The event was relatively pacific, although a handful of concealed activists placed small explosive nearly one group of government buildings in the city Centre.
In a day in which little came about in the conversations about the climate sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists walked for the city holding banners in English that said "Not there is no ' and a B planet and one in Spanish that declared, "the Earth says "it already is enough".
Several famous ones joined the protest, even the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the Peru journeys the homeland of his mother, made me conscious of the distressing matters with which the country must fight due to the impacts of the climatic changes that are already happening.
This belongs, ambitious and binding, to the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and to appeal to the leaders of the world, so that they present a fair agreement exactly appeared.
This is not an easy task, but has to be done, there is not way of eluding it for more time.
The police prevented the demonstrators from approaching the Bella Center too much, and told 19 people that they had arrested, mainly because of the use of truth or because it carried of knives of pocket.
According to the Danish law those activities are prohibited during the demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked that he was not identified because it was implicated in the discussions on the climate, with masks a sports activists and black attires they placed several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is near several ministries.
They were for the buildings, said, adding that they started as blazes, but that they were followed by "a couple of large explosions."
In the centre of conventions the people met around the screens of television to look at the motion during the whole evening.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate key as Su Wei, negotiator in head of China on the climate, in the awareness of key officials.
When it was asked to him if he thought that the demonstration was having a constructive impact in the international discussions, he answered in English, "It was really not to the tanto of the situation".
Afterwards it kept saying in Mandarin, "as the place of meeting is big, I can not hear what passes outside."
It indicated that defining whether the motion was being harmful or beneficial depended on the prospect of each.
He told to the issue of climate change that this shows the attention of the general public in general and of different sectors.
On the other hand, it can also be said that they affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
The data of a test reveal racial differences persistent
The federal notebook of qualifications of the week passed on the performance in mathematics, was a very good news for public schools district capital.
Although the District is still far from the systems with better performance of the country the report card showed that the pupils of the fourth and eighth degree gave skips to a faster rhythm during the last two years, with regard to the cities of, Chicago and New York.
But what remains recorded in the recent ciphers of the national assessment of progress in education is the persistent difference of performance between afro-americans students and white students, at local level as well as at national level.
The average punctuations of the remarks as long white pupils of fourth degree of the A.D. during the last two years, from 262 to 270 (in a scale of 500) grew, but their peers afro-americans increased just three points, 209 to 212.
In fact the difference of performance grew among 2007 and 2009 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the degree of the eighth remained essentially afro-americans remained essentially fixed, bringing a fixed point insignificant down statistically, of 245 to 244.
The average punctuations of the remarks as long white were not included in the results of proof, because the sample size was not big enough.
Throughout an extension of six years the picture is not more encouraging.
The difference that separated the white and black pupils of fourth degree in 2003, when the first ENPE in the District was introduced, was of 60 points of the scale (262 to 202).
Even if the punctuations achieved by the children in both groups have increased during this period the difference itself has hardly reduced to 58.
Some lawyers of education in the District expressed concern last week, since the advancements celebrated by the rector A. The Rhee and the mayor M. Fenty (Democratic), impulse were given to a large extent by white students, who are already very good pupils.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole attending to those in the top of the scale, which is problematic and troubled, appeared Jeff Smith, Executive Director of Voice, an organization without ends of profit that advocates the educational fairness in the district.
I am not giving jumps of joy for a difference of two or three points, said the Council member of the A.D., Kwame R. Brown (Dem. -For accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth degree of the.
Brown, an assiduous reviewer of the style of administration of Rhee, said that the message of the remarks as long of proof is that the secondary schools in the city have a desperate need attention.
It is clearly always wanted to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But what is worrying is that we are not dedicating or the time or the energy for our schools.
Rhee said that the District needs to keep finding better ways of tackling the needs for the students.
This autumn, for example, some professors is being trained to use a new curriculum of reading, the System of reading in its early Wilson, directed to students of the higher levels of primary school and average, that the foundations of reading in its early did not dominate in its early school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
The mathematics of every day, a curriculum of mathematics from kindergarten up to sixth degree, which emphasizes games and experiences of the real life, which was introduced in the District under the ex superintendent Clifford Janey, for which something of the progress informed by the ENPE last week is vouched for.
I only think that we have to keep working to offer the best speeches to those students that are below the level of degree, expressed Rhee.
Others say that the results of the highlight the question of if Rhee being able keep increasing the overall performance of the system and even then provide extra money and resources for schools of low yield, which will be necessary to decrease the difference.
Here there is a sort of crude dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education in the University of California in Berkeley, who studies remarks as long urban of evidence.
The solution of the conventional policy is their resources and administrative reforms to be destined to schools located in the poorest sections of the A.D.
Then the objective can generate political repercussions that go against that important chronogram.
But the problem, is of course that, as other urban superintendents, she tries to cling to the black and white middle-class.
Our focus is in assuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We have to reinforce our barriales schools, so that all the families, without taking into account where they live, have confidence in which their children can access an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of the schools of Newark, said in an interview this week that an essential element to finish with the difference of performance is to stretch the year of schools of, at present of 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It has to be arrived at almost 200 days to have the strength of change, said Janey, which arrived to an agreement with the Union of their teachers the year passed in a year of 185 days, which considers as an " indicator " to look for a greater increase in the next Convention.
Doing of higher education a part of more future
The tourist bus arrived to the University of with a strong are exhausted.
12 years, went down and flashed during a moment in front of the columns of women, the façades of bricks and the esmeralda meadows.
The fathers of had hardly graduated in a secondary school in.
Until not long ago, Graciela same, that was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, it had never put a foot in a university campus.
Still like this, when it and the other pupils of eighth degree of the group explored Gettysburg, where registration plate, where the costs 38.690 dollars per a year its attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiasts potential students.
Yes! Here it is where I will be! he shouted out Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the building of science.
Caray, seriously?, said pensativamente, when the guide talked about the low professor - students proportion of the school.
The University of was the seventh that the children had visited in their journey of three days, and they had completely already absorbed its deliberate message: The question is not if you are going to go to the university.
The question is to which.
Although there is increasing worry about the great number of children born in United States of Hispanic immigrants who leave secondary school or they remain pregnant in the adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands that access the university education that they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one of every five of these Hispanics "of second generation" it is graded in the university, a remarkable achievement since many of their parents immigrants, especially Mexican and Central America, entered the United States without finishing secondary school.
Their success stories are important, state the investigators, because they indicate the path to continue for a generation that will have a very important role in the labour force of the country.
Those who analyze those of biggest yield say that often they have a natural affinity for school and an inborn trend to have successful.
Many have also fathers who establish high goals for their children and find modes of compensating its lack of familiarity with the American schools.
But the programs of mentoring can also have a unique role to help Graciela and millions of children as it arrive to the university, particularly if the efforts hold up in the time.
Observing children of low admissions, whose parents do not have the experience and the skills to help them to sail for the system, it is deduced that any intervention at any time is not going to solve it, Patrician Gándara, an investigator of the University of California, Davis, said who has examined Latin students.
We have to think about providing a network of support for these children, from the garden of infantes up to secondary school.
The federal program that financed the tour in the universities of is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, provides more than usd 300 million per year to local school systems, to execute the programs of university preparation, that they start half when the university students of low incomes are at school and they continue until it finishes the secondary school.
From 1999, the programme has helped to more than 10 million students, with more of 60 per cent frequenting the university, according to the Department of Education of the United States.
The Ministry of Iraqi oil reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
In spite of the worries about the violence and political instability the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to reconstruct their fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that they concluded on Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Ministry of Iraqi Oil reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and the European oil companies are prepared to have a major role in the restoration of the oil industry of Iraq, cripple per decades of war and sanctions.
American companies distanced having bidden in only two of the 10 auctioned beds.
Seven US companies had paid to take part in the second auction, which it started on Friday.
The only one that presented an offer lost.
Two American companies reached agreements for beds auctioned in June.
The poor representation of the American oil giants in the opening of the oil industry in surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of US companies, there is Asian and European in front, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Forum of Oil of Iraq, a center of news in line.
He will pass a lot of time before it is a little more in offer in.
The worries about the safety, highlighted by massive coordinated bombardments on Tuesday, and political instability while the US military are withdrawn, probably it prevented to the American oil companies to be risked more vigorously in Iraq, which has the third most important reservation of oil in the world, stated the analysts.
US companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because the rivals, particularly Chinese and other companies of energy controlled by the government, have considerably lower Labour costs and are more prone to take risks because they do not answer before the shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
The main American firms, as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which has narrowed links with the Ministry of Iraqi Oil and has provided technical advice in recent years, distanced with the empty hands.
The Lukoil Russian companies and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts granted this weekend.
The National Corporation of Oil owned by the Chinese state, offered in more contracts than any other company did and it achieved large investments in contracts for two main fields.
We know that China is in path of being converted in a major power, economic and technological, expressed the spokesman of the Ministry of.
We have confidence in which the company that China will be at par of their competitors and will comply with its commitments towards.
The companies preselected to present suggested did offers that afterwards confronted the subsidy for barrel that the ministry was ready to pay to increase the production above the current levels in every field.
The main planner of to the Qaeda has been, in an apparent way, murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that a supposed attack with American missile on the border of Pakistan with Afghanistan has killed a main planner of operations of to the Qaeda this week, the officials of the American counter-terrorism said on Friday.
If it was confirmed, this would be the second mortal attack against a high-ranking terrorist leader this autumn.
Saleh to the - Somali was one of the two Arab men that it is thought that has died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles were startling against its car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province Waziristan of the North, according to American sources and Pakistani and officials of the region.
Local authorities said that the missiles were thrown by a not identified airplane, of the type operated on for the CIA inside of the area tribal illegal of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, towards the Afghan border, when the car received the impact, it said a civil servant of the agency of civil intelligence of Pakistan, talking for telephone, from.
The civil servant told that the suspected local militants were precipitated to the place and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were incapable of verifying the identities of the victims, but two officials of the American counter-terrorism mentioned not specified proofs that Somali was among the dead people.
It was described To Somali as a high-ranking military planner of to the Qaeda, that it directed the operations of the terrorist group out of the region of.
It dedicated to conspiring in throughout the world, said a tall civil servant, who talked from the anonymity, mentioning the delicate nature of the American air attacks in the Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspirativos attacks against the United States and Europe.
It had strategic guidance of the higher command of to the Qaeda and translated it into operational patterns potential for terrorist attacks.
The second official told us said that Somali had risen quickly in the ranks of to the Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It can not be a name known for some Americans, but that does not decrease any way the threat that suggested us to us and to our allies, stated the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of to the Qaeda or leader Talibán murdered from September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the three tribal area, and three tribal area, and other senior officials.
The rhythm of the attacks of directed not piloted airplanes for the CIA has handicapped person since the summer, of an average of approximately six operations at the month to two, according to a counting of The Long War Journal, a web site directed by a non-profit Organisation without profit motive.
The reduction is owed maybe to a tactics improved by the terrorist groups, which have taken action to limit their vulnerability while they murder cruelly suspected informants, stated the site.
The maximum envoy of UN envoy in to point of renouncing
The maximum envoy of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said the Friday that would renounce their place in March, finishing with a tumultuous mandate that was seen damaged by accusations of extended corruption in the presidential choice of Afghanistan backed up by the UN.
The departure of comes about when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30 000 additional American troops to.
The UN envoy said that it backs the increase up, but it worries it that the American chronogram for the military withdrawal that it starts in 18 months gives impulse to other governments of the NATO to withdraw its forces.
We have to speed up the preparation of the Afghan security forces and to send the right signal to the Afghans for that they can trust the international community, indicated Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The compromise has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomatic also pressed to the United States and to other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants, who collaborate with the international political transition from.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civil sector, stated.
Eide said that he was not resigning, but did simply not comply with a promise that he did to his family in March 2008, of passing only two years in.
He said that he wanted to notify the Secretary
The UN General Ban Ki-moon, so that it had time to find a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better that they start to look for a successor, expressed Eide.
When I arrived here, there was a vacuum of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has started to look for a replacement, according to UN officials.
The civil servants tell that they have been considering To Staffan I gave Mistura, a Swedish - Italian citizen that directed recently the mission of the UN in Baghdad, and to Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French that previously managed missions of peace of the UN.
The position of Eide in Afghanistan was put to tested before its former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused it in September of favoring the President in the presidential vote of the country and of covering evidence of a massive fraud.
Eide denied the charges, but said that the accusations of, who was dismissed, it probably damaged the mission, because there was already a lot of scepticism in regard to the ' international interference in the election.
Eide said that it suggested the appointment of one loudly civil representative to coordinate the aid effort on the part of the forces driven by United States in Afghanistan.
It also gave impulse to the leadership of the UN to allow its successor to hire more staff of the and other occidental countries, which lend themselves to the Afghan mission, stating that this would increase its confidence in which their money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limits to its powers in, holding that the annoying regulations of recruitment cumbersome regulations of the reduce its capacity to collect talent.
Such is so the rules of the allowed me to recruit a person since May, appeared.
That is catastrophic and can not continue.
Gates: They will go will confront additional sanctions
The Secretary of defence, Robert M. Gates, said the Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" against Iran, for his failure in starting talks on their nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 American troops in the north of Iraq, during a journey of a week in areas of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, took importance to the prospect of a military action away from it against the Islamic Republic.
There are not good options in Iran, held, in reply to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of this event.
One of the things that he weighs up for me is that, if we have learned something of Iraq during the last six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a packet of sanctions directed to the military and political elite of, but Gates indicated that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian people in general.
He held that "a packet of incentives and disincentives ", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would be really less sure with nuclear weapons ", would be necessary because its people will suffer" the sanctions " enormously ".
On Friday, in a declaration of the spokesman of the White House the administration joined the European leaders to warn that Iran will confront " believable " consequences if its nuclear programme does not respect the indications of the Security Council of the UN and its organism of nuclear control the International Atomic Energy Agency, completely.
They will go insists in that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In discussions in on 1 of October, indicated that it would negotiate on the restriction of its nuclear programme again and it would agree to leaving a substantial part of its reservation of uranium enriched, in exchange for the fuel that is needed desperately for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for this agreement, as a mode of building trust between the two parties and gaining time for the negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have been moved away from the agreements tentative, steps, partially, state the experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided up in relation to the possibility to commit itself with the United States.
Frankly, I think that the hardening of Iran with the international community on some proposals that in fact accepted at the beginning of October, has joined to the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in one way in that they have not been it in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, expressed Gates.
The president Obama has put as deadline on 31 of December so that Iran answers to the proposals, before rethinking other options, even to pursue with what the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hillary Rodham Clinton, called "devastating sanctions" once."
In a declaration done in New York, the mission of Iran in the face of the United Nations denounced the that called on the Thursday "unfounded and lacking accusations of basis ", on behalf of some members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities of Iran, and it said that it is willing of continuing with the talks with the and five other world powers, "in order to obtain an appropriate solution, in the long term.
Gates, who was going to go back to Washington on last Friday, ran in the morning into the First Iraqi Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, before flying to the rich Kurdish region of Iraq of oil, to meet troops in and officials Kurds in.
The tensions are still high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of, particularly with regard to the borders, the rights of ownership and the copartnership.
Gates was urgent to both parts to decrease the potential for the conflict, to prevent any delay in the projects of United States, to reduce the number of American troops of 115 000 to 50.000 towards end of August.
Gates also tried to relieve the Kurdish anxiety on the pending reduction. the American officials mentioned the words of Gates to Massoud Barzani, the prime minister regional of the Kurdistan: " We " will "preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy in a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In a China that ages a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew surrounded by posters of advertising that lectured them on the fact that mother Earth is too tired to sustain more children" and a baby but means a grave more. "
They learned the lesson so well that, when civil servants of the government of Shangai, alarmed by the low birth rate and the population aged of their city, changed direction in a sudden way this summer and started to encourage young couples to have more of a child, its reaction was instantaneous and firm: any way.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
It does not remain us at all for a second, an administrator of human resources with a child of eight months said 31 years.
More than 30 years after spoiled only children were introduced by the policy of one-child policy in, creating two generations of notoriously dumpy children, affectionately nicknamed "small emperors", a demographic crisis is rising up in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen right down to 1.8 children per couple, compared with the six of when the policy was made effective, according to the Division
Demographical of the UN, whereas it is foreseen that the number of residents of 60 years and more will explode of 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent towards 2050. This is very above the global average global of approximately 20 per cent.
The imbalance is worse in the rich coastal cities with populations, as very cultured.
Last year, the people of 60 years and more counted almost 22 per cent of the residents registered of Shangai, while the birth rate was less of a child for couple.
Xie Lingli, manageress of the Commission of Family Planning and municipal population of, has declared that the fertile couples must have babies "to help reduce the proportion of the aged population and to tone down future a shortage of labour. "
Shangai is about to be "so old (not so rich, however) as developed countries as Japan and Sweden," stated.
A gradual relief
Written out in the constitution of the country in 1978, the policy of one-child policy of is possibly the most polemical mandate introduced up to date by the Communist.
The couples that violate the policy confront huge fines, up to three times its annual salary in some areas, and discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese officials have answered for the policy for its contribution to prevent critical pressure on its natural resources, whereas human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas some officials have obliged pregnant women with a second son to submit to abortions.
Besides, many couples have done abortions according to the sex of the foetus, taking to one unnatural discharge male - woman proportion.
In recent years the demographic officials have softened gradually its position on the policy of only child.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which the husband as well as the woman are children, and only, and in 2007 toned down many of its hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor of the Institute of Demographical Research of the University of, said that the officials of the central government have been discussing recently even more radical changes, as allowing at the couples having two children if one of the spouses is an only son.
In July, Shangai was converted in the first city China in launching a campaign to encourage more aggressive to encourage more aggressive births.
Almost of the evening the morning, the posters, that they ordered the families to have one child they were replaced by copies of regulations that they detailed who would be suitable to have a second child and as requesting a Licence.
The government of the city sent officials of family planning and volunteers to visit partners in their homes and to slide brochures under the doors.
He has also promised to provide those that have chosen to have more of a child with financial and emotional approach.
The officials of family planning say that the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing answer
Even if the civil servants of a rural city in the outskirts of hold that they observed a moderate increase in the applications for couples that want a second child after the launch of the campaign the more urban districts do not indicate any change.
For example the municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115 000, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
The disappointed civil servants of Shangai say that, in spite of the campaign, it is still foreseen that the number of births in the city of 165 000 around 2010 only reaches around 165.000,ligeramente superior to that of 2009, but inferior to that of 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the committee of family planning of the municipality Caolu in Shanghai, said that the financial considerations are probably the main motif for which many people do not want more children.
They want it to give the best thing to their first child, stated.
Yang Jiawei, of 27 years, and his wife, of 26, said that they would love their having two children and are legally enabled to make it.
But as many Chinese, they have only medical insurance and of life insufficient that it provides them with the government.
Without a network of social protection, they hold, this option would be irresponsible.
The people in the West see incorrectly the policy of only child as a question of rights, an engineer of the construction the wife is pregnant of seven months of the first child of the partner, said Yang.
Yes, they are stealing the possibility to have more of a child from us.
But the problem is not only a political issue.
It is the money.
Other couples mention psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang the Administrator of human resources, said that he wants a single child because it was also it: "Eramos the centre of our families and we were gotten used to all taking care of us.
We are not gotten used to taking care of others and do really not want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, of 42 years, explained owner of an agency of translations in more firmly.
For the fathers with two careers, of middle class, who reduce the birth rate, it stated, it is a matter of having sufficient success as to be egoistical.
The people of between 20 and 30 years grew seeing the fight of their parents during the first days of the experiment of China with the capitalism and do not want this kind of life for themselves, appeared.
Even a single child requires a lot of time of the fathers, held.
A mother has to renounce at least at two years of social life.
Afterwards there are questions of space, "have to remodel their apartment", and the strategic one "has to have a curriculum prepared for the best crèches when the child has 9 months."
Most of his friends are ready to confront this once, said Chen, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, appeared.
We do not want to do too many sacrifices.
A group of the sketches a plan to reduce the broadcasts
The conference on the climate sponsored by the UN, characterized until now by challenging postures and mutual recriminations, collected a renewed attention on Friday with the popularization of a document that foresees ambitious reductions of greenhouse gases during the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations that take most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate the greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the path to continue.
But it was seen as an important advance in a negotiation that is staying without time, with more than 100 world leaders who will arrive to Copenhagen next week.
Elaborated by an ad hoc working group of the text does not talk about how much money the rich countries to the poor ones to face the global warming would give to short and long term.
And this offers a range of options for the key questions, that they include how the developed economics and the main emerging economies would cut back their production of coal, and which would be the limit of the global increase of the temperature that political strategists would be ready to tolerate.
This gives it a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, tall representative in Washington for the Saw Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote out document, which drafted the six pages, summarized a text of negotiation of 180 pages to be concentrated in what the maximum climatic civil servant of the UN, Yvo de Bóer, described as the ' big picture. "
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which the industrialized nations would cut back collectively their emissions by 2020 among one 25 and 45 per cent, in comparison with 1990 levels, whereas the main developing countries would reduce his during the same period among one 15 and 30 per cent.
Joint, the countries would cut back the broadcasts among one 50 and 95 per cent towards 2050.
The European Union also stimulated the talks on Friday, promising to provide eur 3.6 billion dollars per year during the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from the floodings and drought to deforestation.
Anyway, on the Friday the same class of verbal fireworks that have dominated the discussions last week was presented.
The special climatic envoy of United States, Todd Stern, rejected the assertions that request obligatory cutbacks of greenhouse gas emissions for the countries industrialized, in comparison with the volunteers from part of the main emerging economies, if they were not financed by the developed world.
The manoeuvre indicated that the Obama administration is adopting a harder line with, with regard to what the officials of the Bush administration made Bush just two years ago.
The United States are not going to do an agreement without the main developing countries advancing and their taking action, appeared Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to assure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern did His comments that it one hour afterwards of the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Chinese He Yafei, stating that the maximum climatic negotiator of United States lacked of "common sense", or was " very irresponsible" for having said before in the week that the United States would not help China face global warming economically.
With the future economic trajectory of the main powers of in the world at stake the eruption of fault lines have made eruption so much in the world in the process of development, as between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current battle is to overcome individual economies as well as to save to the planet, with China and the United States being confronted on their own obligations, while the poorest nations insist in that the twenty-four countries of the world are ignoring the most influential are being unaware of the most influential scientific imperative to take action more courageous.
Ricardo Ulate a representative of, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are discussing about who should pay the expenditure to limit greenhouse gases, still when the vulnerable countries have turned more aggressive looking for containing the big emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, sustained Ulate, who also works as regional adviser on climate change in and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change indicated that they would keep pressing for a treaty legally obligatory in, even if most of the main participants say that the talks will cause a political agreement at the most.
The Alliance of Small Insular States, which he says with 43 members, elaborated a proposal of preliminary Treaty of 24 pages early in the morning on Friday.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the impetus of small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," partially because now they are unified and they require action of the emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks assumed a new urgency while the delegates focused on themselves in the fact that they must solve most of the exceptional questions before the heads of government get to close a deal.
The civil servants of high level, as the minister of Indian Environment Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese vice minister, went down of the airplanes and ran towards the corridors of the Bella Center, to meetings to closed doors and press conferences, to be able to delimit the calls that will be arbitrated between during the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where every the 13.000th people enter and go out from of the centre, the Convention, the activists who play the guitar present night entertainment mocking the countries that according to them are being sold, and preliminary proposals are passed in hand instead of track mail) , poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all the key ministers nail are here now, and on the Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering in the older leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice-president for the global policy of International Conservation.
The heavyweights are arriving.
The first train to 225 kmh of Great Britain redefines this feeling of Monday
To the 5.13 of on Monday in the morning, a trial whistle will perforate the darkness to indicate an exit of train that marks a revolution for journeys in.
The first high-speed intercity train the country will reach the 225 kmh, when it passes as a lightning from Ashford, Kent, to the station of St Panrcas in London, covering 93 kilometres in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis the Secretary of State for transport, will be joined to him afterwards the lady, on board the first intercity service Javelin out of London.
It expects the new service to connect finally to Great Britain to an international network of fast trains, reliable and connects the large conurbations of the, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would be converted in prosperous suburbs, the times of business travel would be shortened and change of aircraft and races to rail would reduce emissions of national coal, like this as they would relieve the congestion in the roads.
In theory the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of thousands of millions of pounds that are needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of the planning and fears on environmental damage, can still stop high-speed lines of.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide a feasibility study to the Government, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on the 30th of December, as he knew the Times.
This will provide it with a detailed itinerary of the following stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line that joins London to the Midlands del Oeste will be drawn in a radius of five metres in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be polemical.
In rural areas the plan will be outlined in a radius of 25 metres of a definitive route.
It is also expected HS2 to establish three options for a wider high-speed net that is addressed to the North.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The favored option that is being suggested is a form of shaping with form of Y, in which one would reach the high-speed line would reach the high-speed line in the.
The line would be divided up in or near Birmingham, with a branch that is directed in the west from the Peninos up to Manchester and Scotland, and another towards the northeast up to Sheffield, Leeds and upon Newcastle Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the most beneficial, " said a member of the railways.
Once finished, the times of journey between London and Edinburgh they would be reduced at 2 a.m. and 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be inaugurated before 2025, would allow the passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, in comparison with the little current little more than an hour.
The proposals would allow 402 kmh the trains traveling, converting the British network into the fastest of Europe.
The initial path is being designed to hold trains of 400 linear mt, capable of transporting 1.1 people.
At least 18 trains could operate on every hour in a line of.
This means that a terminal of London capable of receiving 20 000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Considering the restrictions of space of the capital, it is expected an existing station to be extended to adapt to the high-speed network.
The experts in the railway industry hold that only the station or Euston offer this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he thinks that the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken until after a general election.
Even if it starts off the project the network should be built in sections.
At first the trains would be obliged to leaving the lines fast through the existing lanes in the north of Birmingham, maintaining the times of journey between London and Scotland above the three hours.
This is considered as the necessary crucial point to guarantee a change of aircraft to trains, a point of reference for the railway revolution.
The taxpayers face the mortgage through an orange grove of £75.000 of a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the spokesman of the Conservative Party, was paid to the taxpayer for thousands of pounds to the year for the cost of an orange grove that he built in the house in his constituency.
The spokesman of prisons of the match, which was degraded by David Cameron because he complained about the members living "of rations ", increased its mortgage in £75.000 to build an extension framed in oak in its second home in.
They allowed it to load to The taxpayer the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds to every month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the applications in the time and they have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who drives a revision of expenses of members. Last night Mr. Duncan said that the applications "could not be clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the members of parliament, has a richer, possesses a home of two flats in some people in its constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Close houses have been sold by almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a Kitchen, room of being and dining room, but the office of fees agreed so Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "orange grove".

I dealt with people who I never thought to get to know.
Probably it returns for the World Championship 2010, thrilled Miss says Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news on "is very positive", according to his son
The news on "is very positive", assured his son on Friday when it arrived to the airport of Los Angeles to accompany its father hospitalized since several days ago.
The reports is very positive.
Papá is strong and everything is coming out very well, declared to the press when lowering of the airplane that brought it of Paris little after the 13 local times (21 H) .
The son of the singer, relaxed, assured that Cedars-Sinaï of Los Angeles would move "as soon as possible" to hospital, where Johnny Hallyday deposited Monday for an infection derived from the operation of discal hernia on the 26th of November in Paris.
The musician is "in coma induced to since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of convenience, to avoid his suffering and to be able to administer it like this their treatment," indicated the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subdued to a comma Cedars-Sinaï of Los Angeles induced to by the doctors of the hospital, where he deposited Monday for an infection, sequel of an operation of discal hernia on 26 of November in.
The singer was operated on once again the night of Wednesday to Thursday because of severe injuries caused by the previous speaker.
His wife was on the Friday in the morning to the French Lyceum of Los Angeles, which its daughter Jade attends, to witness a school act, confirmed a photographer of the AFP.
The Head of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology of the hospital of the Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced to Los Angeles that he would travel on Monday to be beside the way.
The producer accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on 26 of November in the international private hospital of the Park Monceau, in Paris, of violent way.
They told us that it was a massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said that they were indignant, declared Camus.
It is talked about a possible demand, said.
Jean-Claude Camus held that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too quickly to Los Angeles with the authorisation of the Paris surgeon".
I talked directly with the doctor and surprised me when it assured me that there was not no problem in doing the journey, for I was operated on twice, added.
Little before in the station, it indicated that apparently the singer had "left without cannula, without anything," after its operation of Paris.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well-known in the artistic environment.
He operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a private hospital of Neuilly - south - Seine where Delajoux worked in that time.
In 2007, he also operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to re-absorb a bruise formed as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage.
It is a doctor with bad reputation, condemned by the justice on several occasions for malapraxis, as also for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the order of doctors, accused him of being "a gutless man" sued "with regularly " before the Board of the Order, and it is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux talked on Friday through his lawyer.
This indicated that the speech "was carried out without any problem " and that the results of the postoperative studies were " normal ".
The operation "could not provocarhemorragias and portanto, did not need drainage, added.
Anyhow, the tour of the singer, whose health problems multiply since the summer, entered a parenthesis.
With no doubt, to take up the tour on 8 of January (in Amiens, NDLR) as it was planned, seems me very risky, declared Camus.
The partnership lifts the tone and warns the new Centre on the use about its acronym
The association UDF (Union for the French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday in the face of the attempt at the president of the new centre, of launching an OPA (takeover bid) on the symbol from the giscardista ex match, becoming it friendly to withdraw it from all support, on pain of being sued.
Hervé Morin announced publicly its intention of recovering the acronym, since he considers that François Bayrou was not in position of defending its political heritage after the hand having tended for him towards the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defense, whose party is associated to the UMP, had foreseen to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the national Council of the.
As support for its management, received the help of the representative Hervé de Charette (ex UMP, current NC) who claims the estate of the marks, then it was the first in registering it in the National Institute of Patent Rights in 2004.
But on the Friday at night, the office of the association UDF, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou that do not want to be seen deprived of this, broke the silence to throw a call to on the minister and to the member becoming them friendly to renounce to the acronym and to transfer the laws of estate of the mark, on pain of legal proceedings.
These last few days, you have made many statements insinuating to his political movement that they were going to suggest recover the acronym, writes the partnership in one card signed by 19 of the 24 members of the Bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as also to the senator Jean Athuis de la Alianza Centrista.
They also believe correct to continue +l'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ with the use of the name of the movement, the +Nouveau centre+, and of the slogan in his militant material and on the page of presentation of his seat, they sustain the signatories of the Charter.
As they already know it, they do not have any law to using the acronym, explains the office of the UDF that requires that the NC withdraws "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF all support, as also of (his) Internet site.
It also asks To de Charette ' that transfer of "it to transfer the estate of (the) marks to the legitimate.
If he does not make it, the justice will be appealed to do to respect the law and the legitimate laws of the members of the, notice the signatories.
In the Charter, they need the UDF to "be a real political movement since 1978" and remember that Morin and their friends " chose "to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others in 2002 had already made it to create the UMP".
Therefore the new Centre does not have, according to them, any law to using the acronym.
Likewise they remember that the last Congress of the voted in 2007 its adhesion to the modem for three years and the creation of an office responsible for defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, it pursues the office, "when it registered the mark ", any longer it was not "member of the UDF for three years ", but of the UMP.
UDF makes use of the absence of registration of the acronym in Scandalous manner and fraudulent to carry it out for their own.
This is changing indiscretion is being transformed into crime, denounce, before mocking the strategy of the: "We think that in politics, as in life, doing its own name is worthier than trying to go out of anonymity taking in a fraudulent way a name that is not had right".
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be judged by abuse of weakness
This Friday the Nanterre Tribunal decided to submit François-Marie Banier to judgment to the artist to determine whether, as the daughter of the multimillionaire one states Liliane Bettencourt, she took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenarian to pillage it of a part of their fortune.
The photographer of 62 years, acquaintance for its photos of stars of the arts, will be judged on the 15th and 16th of April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and 375.000 euros of fine.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga on one of the richest families of France, in which mother and daughter fight over the reins of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the Court public prosecutor no 15 also ordered Liliane Bettencourt, of 87 years of age, being subdued to a medical examination in charge of three medical practitioners.
The heir and main shareholder de always refused to being submitted to these tests, even more in the conditions suggested by the Public Prosecutor of during the investigation.
The doctors designated this Friday will have to deliver a report before the 10 of March 2010 in the one that will have to do to figure if Liliane Bettencourt suffered states of weakness and during what periods.
I think that it will accept.
I am going to talk with it, the advocate of Mrs declared Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman, when going out of the hearing.
On its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, appeared pleased by the decision of the court.
It is excellent news (.) El expert's report will show that it (Banier) manipulated this old woman, who we must protect, stated.
Since two years ago, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt initiated criminal action against, photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing it of use having been made of me for years of the weakness of its mother to obtain a billion euros in donations, by issuing, contracts of life insurance or works of art.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, to the one who considers a longstanding friend dates.
On Friday, while the court examined the origin in the action interposed by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers the pleas of lawyers worked out, on some cases, a great family confession.
This way the advocate of took three cards that its clienta sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to its notary public in which it said that he mistrusted the husband of into account.
In the card of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "it could explain to my daughter that I wrote between one and two times per day for fifteen years to Banier.
From Their wedding, I could not talk ever more with Françoise again".
On its part the public prosecutor's office of considered, once again, which the complainant was not in a position to appearing, so much more as much as that a judge of venture refused, on recent days, to doing rise to its request of opening a procedure of legal protection for their mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity for appearing in the face of the justice, is not found under supervision and does not have tutor.
Any other person will be able to appear in its place", stated the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally the court decided that he would pronounce itself once the judgment carried out on the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Managerial revolution or end of the intelligence of business?
If nothing changes in the management of the French big businesses, our fight for the development of the intelligence of business will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the address of large companies with regard to their employees remembers the position of the companies with regard to consumers before the revolution of marketing: itself trade that the colleagues stick " values " determined from above as before it was a matter of imposing products thought by the technical factory on the consumers.
When putting the customer in the centre of the company the revolution of marketing gave him its place to the strategies of conquest of the markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that do not have relation with the factors of preference of the customers is repeated with regular basis.
A demobilisation of employees can finish in a deadly demoralisation.
The suicide in, PSA or Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that affects particularly the executives.
This demobilisation jeopardizes severely the development of all intellectual development of all the functions of the company, especially of the I+D and, still more, of the intelligence of business.
Indeed, the BI (Business Intelligence) "requires that all the involved parts (.) have a proactive and conduct and a forward-looking vision"; this needs on the part of the employees an appointment that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian direction.
For that reason, we call for a managerial revolution, which would consist in putting the staff in the center of the concerns of the company as the customer.
Opinion polls have a useful on internal have a useful on
Will the internal publi-opinion polls, as the questionnaire carried out by Orange among their employees, incite at the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I fear that not.
-In principle, because I could verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many twists and turns all companies end up doing essentially... what they always made!
-In the second place, because the authoritarianism, one of the conditions of power, grows proportionally to the importance of their own failures.
-Finally, because most of the managers have a simplistic vision of human behaviour.
As they originate from the great schools of engineers, they interpret the psychology in mechanistic way.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old conductista theory that the American " neurosciences " reactivated recently, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media spread widely to their backs.
This way, when to suggest that handling the " commands " (sic) of the commitment of the executive is possible, a recent research of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms to the managers in a posture of mechanicist management, unadapted to today's world.
Identifying and measuring the factors of mobilisation
On the contrary, the necessary managerial revolution for the proper functioning of modern companies, means adopting a specific vision of human behaviour.
It consists in integrating into all reasoning or practice of business management a basic fact: for the employees the commitment to the company is only possible if this appears clearly as a means to bring about part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Nowadays, only the studies original from the analysis take on this conception of the motivations of employees.
The studies proved that they judge their company basing themselves on a predetermined doxa that them allows, through the image that they have of the company, to evaluate what this offers them to reach their own projects of life.
Thanks to the identification and to the measurement of the factors of mobilisation, managers of companies can control, to foresee and to anticipate its "social performance" and human derecursos "in the place" to relocate the management.
This way, they create a favourable ground for the development organized of a strong and effective business intelligence and effective.
Speech of Oslo: by the "just war" Obama receives praise comes from the right
This Friday, the American right, satisfied that the Prize Nobel de la Paz 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of United States, acclaimed the speech that Obama had pronounced on Thursday.
The conservatives, who had discredited the delivery of to award the prize on the 9th of October this time applauded the presidential speech, as Sarah Palin, ex candidate to the vicepresidency during the elections in 2008.
I loved what he said, Mrs. Palin testified, leading light of the right wing of the Republican Party to the newspaper USES Today, and she added that she herself had tackled the subject of the " necessary " war " sometimes " in its recently published memories.
In my opinion the war is, of course, the thing last that the North Americans want to be seen obliged to doing, but it is necessary.
The terrorists has to be arrested, observed.
Obama, that it inherited the two wars of its predecessor W. Bush in Iraq and in Afghanistan, a way of explaining its decision of sending 30.000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days before was dedicated, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use by force.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "a very good work" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very well, the ex president of the Camera of Representatives, who the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" noticed particularly in the presidential words, cheered up.
Per moment, the speech seemed me very historical, declared Gingrich, during a radio interview in the programme of "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, that some consider as a possible candidate to the republican investiture for the presidential elections in 2012, was shown pleased when listening to a president of left" when it remembered to the Nobel Committee members of the Nobel "that they would not be free nor they could deliver a prize for peace if the use by force there" was not.
According to Michael Gerson, author of the speeches of George W. Bush and current chronicler in the Post, Obama pronounced "a very North American speech".
Besides being presented as "citizen of the world", as "always it does" it", "it talked as an American president" when remembering to the Europeans "that live in a bubble of security that they did not create and that do not do a lot for preserving it", stated Gerson.
Among the few of right not very convinced, a falcon of the era of Bush, the ex ambassador in the UN, John Bolton, qualified the speech as "monotonous, pretentious and falto of inspiration" in the place of Internet National Review Online.
To the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich alarmed himself when seeing Barack Obama justifying the use by force.
When we cover the war against the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of the innocents, warned.
However the press Centre left praised the president.
The Angeles Time, although it keeps thinking that Obama received the Nobel in a premature way, it qualified its speech of " overproduction " especially for a speaker known by his talent.
The speech of Oslo "it should be used as roadmap for guiding the international decisions in the fight against international conflicts, the poverty and the oppression", commented on the Californian newspaper thrilled.
Obama "pronounced the speech that was necessary", estimated the New York Times, judging it "at the same time of gloomy and edifying".
Transport cart driver: three maratónicas negotiations to guarantee Christmas to guarantee the supply
After three maratónicas sessions of negotiations, the trade unions of in the sector of roads and the TLF (Transport and logistics of) , the only employer organization that until the end remained, arrived on Friday in the afternoon to an agreement that puts an end to the slogan of strike and to the threat that falls on the supply of Christmas.
During the session of signatures on Friday evening, the secretary of State for transport, Dominique Bussereau, he "cheered up" for the agreement, after several sessions of negotiation that started on Wednesday in the morning.
After a second night of discussions the negotiators said goodbye at dawn to on Friday with the expectation to sign quickly the text in agreement late on of the morning.
Even though three employer organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) retired giving the door.
But a meeting of more than six hours that it started at the 11 H was necessary so that they all are come to an agreement and the text is signed at the 18 H
The conflict "had been very harmful to the companies" and "it "was feared that it disturbs the holidays of new year", declared Bussereau.
The text foresees an increase of for the lowest salaries (in road transport local and regional), and of 2,9% for the highest (international transport) .
The fee per hour goes up of 8,72 euros to 9,06 for low wages.
It is not a lot, but start with great disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If it is like this, we are going to give the order to our militants that there are not more cuts or blockades in the centres of supply.
But there can always be some disagreeing rebel, added.
Philippe Grillot President of the, recognized that it is "a good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant increases to higher wages taking the international competition into account".
According to it the increases will be in the order of eur 170 month to low wages and 100 to eur 120, to the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense and that respects the employees, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historical agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable appointment".
Likewise the agreement foresees an increase in the expenses of displacements of 3% and the celebration of general assemblies of the transport by road in the first semester of 2010, which they will allow especially tackling the subject of an extra payment and of modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau remembered that "a decrease of eur 100 million in the employers ' burden " was the target of an amendment of the government in the draft law of finance of grinding for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will request "the same terms" from the Senate that votes it " low ".
The signing of allows the agreement to apply, in the first place, to the companies stuck to this Organisation and, in the second place, to all the profession, in the event of the Minister of Work doing an extension.
It will get hold "of as soon as possible ", assured Bussereau.
The opposition of employers ' organisations could only defer the process.
The FNTR reported that it was a "business of naive" ones, since the 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate part of the CO2 tax to the CO2".
The State Secretary of transport obliged us to negotiating in a situation of urgency, not as, the Unostra was regretted by conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to upset those that want to eat turkey in the next Christmas Eve dinner.
For the OTRE the agreement puts at risk stability of many PYME of in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER TO: conflicts during the weekend, trade unions disagreeing with the proposals of the
The conflicts in the RER A, the line of largest urban public transport of, are going to continue during the weekend, because in the meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and the direction of the, there was not agreement and trade unions remained unsatisfied as for his request for premium.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, on Saturday and Sunday trains will only circulate between the only 10 H and the 20 H, at the rate of a train of every two in the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and a train of every four in the other lines.
The interconnection with the will be suspended in Nanterre Préfecture, which will oblige the passengers to change train.
The Galleries Lafayette, which 200 000 customers wait for every day, cheered up of "the RATP striving to offer service to the big stores".
The RER A crosses the city of Paris of to crosses from West to East.
The section goes from Saint-Germain - in - Laye and Nanterre up to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne - La-Vallée.
This Friday, approximately one of every two trains circulated in rush hours, and almost no train in valley hours, as it had been foreseen.
On Thursday there was not disorder in the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of.
Of this way, at, the station of Saint-Germain - in - Laye (Yvelines) it was a lot less busy that what is normal, especially for the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val - of - Marne) , Jack Nbakina engineer, 29 years, explained that "an hour and half " had been lifted "earlier to arrive to hours ".
The station was not saturated, indicated the SNCF, who had foreseen the supervision of police and forces of law and order.
The RER A that the SNCF operates on original of Cergy-Le-Haut or bound for this arrived or Saint-Lazare set off from the station to join at the metres.
New general assemblies of workers will be on strike will take place on Saturday and on Sunday. The results, "little satisfactory" according to the trade unions, will be analyzed of a meeting that was carried out with the direction on Friday in the afternoon.
The director of the suggests negotiating a specific protocol in all the aspects for the RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
What the drivers want who claim a premium that is owed to them, according to Thierry Garon (Sud), is not that.
The RATP puts even between parentheses its proposals of premium, commented indignant the CGT, indicating that the direction "was not capable of solving a problem that the SNCF and the sector of road had already solved".
A new meeting is foreseen on Monday to carry out "a larger analysis on the conditions of exercise of the profession", needed the RATP.

The Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurdish match a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court failed pro-Kurd of the country, a decision that immediately provoked demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the South-East of the country and in Istambul, on the plus Friday of the dissolution of the main match.
This decision could complicate a lot the task of the government, which has just laid a hand out for the Kurdish community trying to put an end for him to 25 years of conflict.
The match of democratic society Party (dtp) was dissolved because it had been converted in the "focus of activities that damaged the independence of the state and its indivisible unit", declared to the press the president of the Court, after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although a majority of seven votes was only needed to obtain the dissolution, indicated Kiliç, and added that 37 of the leaders of the Party, among whom its president and the member are, are moved away from political life for five years.

The DTP counts on 21 bankings in parliament (550) .
Their leaders warned before the verdict that the representatives would abandon the Parliament before being members of parliament without partisan label.
The decision rises as a result of a procedure that it launched the prosecutor of the High Court, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, who accuses to the DTP of obeying the " beginnings " of the Match of Workers of Kurdistan (PKK), for Ankara and through many other countries considered a terrorist Organisation more.
Many observers think that the DTP is the legal political shop window of the rebels of the.
However the Party assures that it does not have "organic links" with the PKK, but he refuses to qualifying it as a terrorist Organisation and he calls for the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the Court takes part in the moment in which the government lays a hand out for the Kurdish community suggesting a series of measures that strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and putting like this an end to the conflict, to her.
The leaders of the stated that a dilution could generate a fresh outbreak of tensions in the anatolio Southeast, where a great number of demonstrations against the conditions of arrest of the head of the PKK, Abdullah Öcalan, degenerated in confrontations with the police during the last few weeks.
From the announcement of the justice, thousands of demonstrators met in front of the sites of dtp local in, the big take care of South-East populated in the main by Kurds.
The forces of law and order threw tear-gas grenades and used water cannons, while the demonstrators launched bombs Molotov or with deep Molotov or stones.
One hundred people also concentrated, on Istambul, approximately.
After the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of the justice system was going to "deepen the despondency.
Turkey can not solve this question (Kurd, NDLR) dissolving a party, declared to the press.
The government, Islamist formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
For principle we oppose the closure of parties.
Like this anything is not solved, the Minister of Energy, Taner Yildiz, testified.
This decision boycotts completely the democratic opening thrown by the government, commented on the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can wait, of course, for a reaction of the, added.
This Thursday, an attack in which seven soldiers died three days before in the North of Turkey, one of the most bloody attacks of recent months, was granted by the PKK.
New Silicon Valley
During many years, it was considered as a city secret, inaccessible to the Western visitors.
Selenogrado, one of the ten districts of, was in the Soviet Union a place strongly guarded for arms secret for research.
Nowadays, the community of 216 000 inhabitants, situated at 37 kilometers of from the centre of, is considered as the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here they find important centers of research and production of micro and nano-electronics.
Already from September 2008 representatives of have gotten in touch with the headquarters of scientist of Riedberg in Frankfurt, with university institutes and the companies of the Center of Innovation of Frankfurt (FIZ).
Various visits were mutual occurred and, on Wednesday, Selenogrado and Riedberg now sign a "Protocol of closer cooperation " in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Vice-Mayor Juri Rosljak and the mayor of Selengrado, Anatoly Smirnov, led the Russian delegation; for Frankfurt the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz signed.
In the 2010 representatives of the and directors of small and medium companies of the center of research of natural sciences will travel to a seminar in.

Selenogrado is the seat of major companies and research institutes Russians.
Among them they find, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the big energy companies and Rossijskaja Elektronika.

Brakes in
The Dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not placed for anything high enough.
For supporters of the project it is treated simple and plainly of "the new heart of Europe".
The law on the. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more that a monstrous building project, which will throw to the capital of the region of a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 rose up from the spirit of the mid-1980s.
Terminals with rails, which they finish in the middle of the city, were considered in that fossils of engineering of the 19th century, which they acted as a modern brakes rail traffic, since formerly an enormous amount of time was needed to stick the locomotives behind forward, then.
Filming, to stop in dry to continue the journey; but like this it must be made.
And that's why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a station on the way, which is found approximately to half of the stretch of the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava; of there the slogan of "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will really be initiated, even though the visions of the eighties any longer are not more compatible with the reality.
Even more ambitious designers have known that in the hessiana and Bavarian capitals it is almost unpayable to implement the reduction.
Rail terminals do of course not have more problems of entry and exit, since there are reversible locomotives with tractora unit and cart of driver and cart at both ends, either.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new built section HOISTS towards Ulm it will already be initiated.
Federal and local politicians have arranged it like this.
The rail continues, also because the taxpayer and not the State takes the risks of the great individual projects of infrastructure of the Republic.
From the point of view of houses yet the draft justifies itself up to a certain point.
New urban space, provided with many areas of the Greens, probably of the graphs generated by the graphic designer generated by computer, is created.
For transport system ferroviario the S21 is noxious.
The step and the station road support are thought for the transport of people, which was attributed to the enormous typical growth of the 1980s.
In that the competence of the flights of low cost did then not occur.
But the first modern transport policy modern first must be occupied of strengthening the freight transport, since rail transport is more ecological considerably than the one carried out by lorries in the roads.
However, the new sections in construction are good for us for trains of burden due to the intense gradients.
More it still taxes is that the S21 also affects indirectly many other projects of railways.
More than six thousand a million euros must be buried in the pontifical.
That is the official number.
The experts consider that it is more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is safe that in the next decade the money will be lacking in other crossings and close passages in the network.
In total sixty bigger projects are in the list of the Ministry of transport.
One of the most important is the enlargement of more than 180 kilometers of long rails across the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the route to step slow is built.
It would be urgent here to tread on the game properly.
However the S21 acts as I stop.
The section of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for the international traffic of freight: through the heart of.
The government examines the judgment on the airport.
The federal government leaves pending in the autonomous parliament, if he is going to present an appeal in the face of the failure on the prohibition of nocturnal flights of by the administrative court of.
The coalition of seems to have ordered experts the legal research of the sentence of the VGH, of more than 400 pages, as it said the Minister of Economics, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in had founded in writing on this date, which in the case of the construction of the northwest runway planned in the airport of Frankfurt, the federal state should establish regulations again the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between the 23 and the five hours, as the federal government foresees it, would not be reconcilable with the obligatory legal protection of the population of due to the air traffic noise.
The coalition has to decide up to the 4th of January, whether she is going to present the appeal against the decision.
The opposition criticized this delay and pressed the representatives of the government so that they renounced the appeal before the Administrative Court of the nation in Leipzig.
The head of the group SPD, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, exhorted the CDU and the FDP to respect its promises of prohibition of the nocturnal air traffic, which they had carried out before the elections. Otherwise this could be taken for lack of word.
It is quite difficult, if to one they leave it to comply their word, the head of the greens said Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the slogan of the FDP "We comply with our word".
The minister rejected the recrimination of Schäfer-Gümbel, which Federative, that the government would be trying through distortions of the law and tricks still like this to obtain their night flights.
A comprehensive legal research would need quite some time.
The coalition would not want to act on the base of a "first fast impression".
We need a decision legally watertight, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
Like this as represents it the opposition, would ever not have been the assertions of his group on the ban on night air traffic.

Rapid choice
In the end everything was faster than people thought.
That Barely two weeks people afterwards of the administrative board of the ZDF (German television channel) pressing the editor-in-chief of to leave its post German television channel can introduce a successor.
Yesterday by night the guild intended to vote about the candidate.
The favourite was Peter Frey, director of the study principaldel ZDF in Berlin.
There was not a confirmation of this on the part of the broadcasting station, officially not to come in advance to the procedure.
But also it probably influenced the Markus Schächter not to damage more the director of the, if this proposal would be approved either in the administrative board.
Frey, the candidate of Schächter, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the Council.
The result of the vote was not yet was not specified at the end of writing of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the administrative board with its proposal of renewing the contract of for others five years.
Only seven members supported to Brender, seven voted against it. the dismissal of was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be waited for.
For that the majority of the Union in the administrative Council already weeks before the election it had indicated, that they were not going to support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief of had been organized by the prime minister of Hesse, the Sr.Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate of the editor-in-chief of prestigious with the argument, which under the leadership of the news of the would have lost audience ratings.
Even little before the elections there were protests due to this, in which he flayed the political influence on the.
In the end 35 specialists in public law, who qualified proceeding as Koch as unconstitutional, had even interfered with the debate.
But it did not act as anything.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on the 4th of August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied policy, education and Romanesque philology.
Afterwards he worked in the broadcasting station " Südwestfunk " and in the journal "Frankfurter Rundschau".
It was changed for the ZDF into 1983, in principle to the news program " heute-journal ".
Following stations: 1988 up to 1990 Rapporteur editor-in-chief of staff; 1991 / 92 correspondent in; up to 1998 director and driver of the morning program " Morgenmagazins "; even the 2001 directive of the foreign policy of the; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the dismissal of Brender, which was still chosen " Magazin " this Wednesday as journalist of the year for the magazine of " Medium " means.
The opponent of Koch in the administrative board the President of the government of, explained last week that the federal states should change the state agreement of the ZDF in such a way, which the proposals of staff of the Director can not be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A retirement of politicians in favor of the guilds of control of the ZDF was discarded by Beck.
The probable successor of Brender, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended before the Council: administrative intelligent move with a: he criticized strongly the guild for the dismissal of.
Thanks to this journalistic test of independence so much Schächter could name it for the post of editor in chief without losing the face, as the administrative board could vote it, without falling under the suspicion that the post gave her a henchman for years in favour.
In the calculations of the matches Frey it is granted anyway to of left to the liberals.
The university degrees clear up
Partial success for students: after a year of strikes related to the education, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federal states at last they yielded. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors both sides were come to an agreement in trying to improve the conditions of study in cases of graduates and masters courses.
Students should in future should be capable of surpassing their careers.
For example they were come to an agreement in reducing the burden of examinations: basically each module of the race must finish with one only examination.
Besides it is intended to examine the Workload of students, and it is wanted to guarantee a "real and justifiable measure".
The policy and the Universities want to simplify besides the recognition of results of examinations among the Universities inside and out of Germany.
Draw up commit themselves to producing the structural rules in more flexible as a whole for careers of Bachelor and masters degree.
Regulations of the federated states that diverge from this, must not exist any longer.
Less examinations
From the beginning of the student protests in June the Ministers of Education and Culture and the directors of universities talk continuously about the improvement of being able to carry out and concluding a career (estudiabilidad) with successful.
Now for first time people talked about a specific content specifically.
The like this called board of accreditation granted of reducing drastically the number of tests: "Every module finishes with one only ends with a test, is said in a document of 30 pages, which intends to establish regulations for the approval of the university degrees partially.
With the "sensitive reduction of the burden of examinations" it is intended to avoid the development in a wrong address, which would affect appreciably the estudiabilidad, like this explained it the director of the board of accreditation, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
Besides the future the " estudiabilidad " must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and the contents must be examined exhaustively as for unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of.
The courses.
The students would have "the law to obtaining more spaces, which make possible and encourage the own initiative."
These rules would be valid for racing new, but also in the examination of existing careers.
These must "be recredited" again every five years. But this would mean, that people were late until 2015 to examine all the careers.
The ones responsible for this would be as for the whole country 10 agencies of credentials, which they find under the monitoring of the Council of accreditation, that are installed by the federal states.
The ministers of education and culture exhorted to the federal states in October to influence in such a way the agencies, which the number of subjects and the tests are not too strict or demanding.
In some federated states the universities and technical universities and schools were already come to an agreement with the ministries to adopt such measures.
Until now Renania-Platinada only assured to facilitate additional resources for the subsequent development of the bologna process.
With this money the universities must implement programmes of mentoring and student advice, as well as strengthen offices of examinations and of from outside.
The Federated State and the universities intend to have 10 million for these purposes.
At the beginning of the 2010 the government wants to take a novel of the university law to the house.
As it should be sufficient one only examination for the ending of a model of career.
The shaping of the race should be done more flexible, besides it is wanted to guarantee the recognition of evaluations in other universities and to facilitate the accessibility of the masters degree.
Up to ends of the year that comes is intended to examine all the careers about its " estudiabilidad ".
This Thursday the government and the opposition discussed again on the conditions of studying in the federal state.
To part of the praise there were also criticism about the decisions.
In the board of management at federal level of the university groups Juso (young Socialists) seexigía, which the make-up of education policy is no longer should not be carried out "after closed doors" of the ministers and the university rectors.
At the latest after strikes of education, the involved students as main ones should now be able to give an opinion also.
The president of the board of university rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her its support to the students: "We need the experience of students", said Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint document on reform.
For the Union of education and science (GEW) the agreements of Bonn were not in a complete way sufficient: the trade union demands a legal right for every student with the title of the possibility to access a masters degree.
Besides the federal states have to guarantee, that for the current generation of students of there are in a future sufficient places of study for Master with the best possible conditions of study. like this a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller, informed it.
The federal states have quecontratar quite a lot of more educational.
But about greater access to the master's degree, the Ministers of Education did not do comments.
More that a note at footnote on
"To enter and to go out of Germany is made practically without control" says the first line of a poem of the lyric Werner Söllner in idiomatic fragments desequilibrantes, in which tematiza the experiences of arrival to Germany lived by a dissident, which gained their freedom, but lost in their language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked at first as professor of German and English in, and afterwards as reader in an editorial of's books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Prizes won a number of literature gave him Söllner, in 1993 it gave the memorable lessons or talks of poem in Frankfurt in the University Goethe, and from el2002 he is a director of the forum of literature in Hesse in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
It gave that to talk quite a lot the last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German Literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of their dossiers of "
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a declaration in which it accepted the participation as IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of German - Romanian writers colleagues, among other Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
As a whole with some of the present ones in 1989, Söllner had received the prize of the German language.
The attempts of recruitment had started slowly, at the beginning of 1971.
"Therefore I am somebody that was not defended enough in the face of the attempts at provocation of fear of the Securitate", finished Söllner.
The lyrical is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time of the concession of the prize Nobel of literature to Herta Müller and literary its controversial without equal with mechanisms with the dictatorial rule the literary stage is shaken and especially the community of native German authors of Romania for a case that makes the divisions evident and the wickedness of a political system, who bases itself on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, by what it is known until now, is not only author, but also a victim.
In their case of IM Walter had a role, said the literary scientist Michael Markel after the admission of, and delIM Walter stressed the influence for it positive.
It had excused it or defended in all the difficult points for it, said Markel.
"I sit the moral need to do this statement ", said.
The declaration of Söllner in this way and in front of this public was unexpected, the confession of an ex-dissident and work with the Romanian secret service, however, does not surprise so much.
Germany would have been a refuge convenient for spies of the Securitate-Spitzel gewesen, already wrote Herta Müller in the month of July in the weekly " Zeit", after having read its own dossier of 914 pages.
The ones involved probably will have speculated and Voicu will have known in some cases, what hid behind the names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, and also of Walter.
Unlike the revision of the dossiers Stasi with a procedure controlled in Germany, the deal with the dossiers of control by the Securitate is still is quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification was seen boycotted and was obstructed in recent years.
A national board for the clarification of the dossiers of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the dossiers since then rather occurs unwillingly.
From the 2005, there is a law that regulates the administration of the dossiers.
An interview, after the concession of the prize Nobel of literature to Herta Müller, proof that the influence of former members of the Securitate in still is quite big. In this interview an ex-head of the Securitate de Temesvar talked derogatorily about the honored one.
"It has psychosis", in the end they only questioned it once.
The shame of power seemed to be able to be shown without turns under the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, unavoidable questions rise with the case, as so often when there are blame quiet betrayals.
Why right now? To whom was damage caused? The reaction soothed of the listeners in the face of the confession of Söllner lets wait that the continuation of this history will be ruled more by the longings of knowledge and not so much for the allocation of blame and by shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the prize Nobel of literature, it is more than a mere footnote.
The League of Champions as garnish to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the equipment of futbol VfB of Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by a plastic bag of orange color of the supplier of his team, approached a cab Mercedes of the Class C a quarter of an hour after the midnight, gave the impression that a member of the elegantly dressed exterior service was going out of a very nice celebration of Christmas, which the manufacturer of sports articles had divided up samples into.
The man of the bald-headed feature had hired a driver, because he did not know the city yet.
For the rest, he himself would also have been able to drive the car: after all, there was not alcohol in stake, and man of 55 years was not inebriated of happy either.
It had been a pleasant, but tomorrow evening, but it would tomorrow start the work again.
O would start for first time.
In words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: It "is true that we reach the eighth of end", to know, in the League of Champions, thanks to the triumph 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, "but we can not leave ourselves to blind for the success: we will have to fight brutally against the decline. "
The "much more important task" waited them the next Sunday, stated.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat the success of the "real classes" in Mainz in everyday life in the league.
And eliminating the weaknesses, which have been evident clearly again, after the fast three goals of Sissy (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Draw
The eighth of end of the League of parties (broken up of IDA the 16 / 17 and 23 / 24 of February / matches of re-matches 9 / 10 and 16 / 17 of March) will be gotten round on 18 of December in.
So it kept the joy for the fulminating entry of the successor of limited.
Not only in the saving supposition, which shortly time had inspired them to the confused profis of self-confidence Stuttgart in itself same, arrangement to be delivered and taste for the game.
I was with the players and said them that they had to be concentrated in its strengths, I told them to be more thrown, explained the reparative one of souls Gross your recipe for success that so simple sounds, but that with the user any longer had not worked.
It displayed a certain magic, accepted the partisan of Babbel, Jens Lehmann, "when in the football a new impetus rises, sometimes happen things that had not been believed possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a pause of several weeks owed to injury due to an advanced immediately until it converted in the best player local thanks to their dynamism, tried to describe the " phenomenon " perceived with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way of working of the new head: "He is a man who takes part in depth, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what had been lacking, evidently, when Babbel was.
The Stuttgart VfB has not passed yet the test, notices sports steering the
But the Stuttgart VfB needs especially on record.
As Gross, also the players and the administrator they refrained from overestimating the victory against a defense weakened for lack of relay and totally gone of the Romanian guests.
They had also improved on Glasgow, before four days in Leverkusen with the 0:4 the sad reality had later arrived, gave to think Khedira.
And The steering noticed that although an objective of the season had been reached, the other one was still very far.
We have not surpassed the problem yet.
That Heldt did not feel, even after the first victory in its headquarters for three months, like celebrating in his birthday number 40 owed to the events of the weekend, which were updated in the form of a television interview, transmitted right before the start of the game, that the caretaker had granted again.
There are decisions that take others, and not Jens, confronted Heldt the harsh criticism of.
This had reproached the directive board, which had decided to change coach for the pressure of coach fanatics adolescents, for weakness in the direction.
Also that their free day had been eliminated after the games qualified it Lehmann as a sign of mistake of sovereignty and hostility.
The statements of were "marked by the pure egoism", it replaced Heldt, and it announced consequences for the zaguero.
Probably, both cuarentones, will not be friends any longer forever.
But at least they agreed with all the others in which, without the previous efforts with the equipment of the replaced coach, the show of great force of gambling and of battle had not been possible.
Babbel and their assistants had "an important participation in the success", said Heldt and Lehmann at the same time; and the man of the plastic suitcase also agreed.
Fight of the World Cup in heavyweights
Ardent mourning in: once and again the retador Kevin Johnsonn was provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended its title of heavyweight in the version of the.
The trial of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko keeps being world champion heavy weight.
The champion of 38 years in the version of the partnership beat in the night of Friday to Saturday in Bern to the American Kevin Johnson for unanimous decision for points (120:108, 119: 109) .
For Klitschko it was your third successful defence of title from its return in October 2008.
Previously the Ukrainian was already a world champion of the associations WBO and WBC twice.
Unfortunately, it could not be carried out the knock out that all had waited.
Klitschko extended its balance sheet to 39 successes in 41 fights professionals, twice it had to consider itself beaten due to their injuries.
The retador Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his fight number 24.
Before about 17000 spectators in the Sand of Bern, Klitschko, with a stature of 2.02 meters, it wanted to dictate the scrap especially with the left hand.
But eleven lower centimetres lower Johnson, which before of mourning had proclaimed the end of the era, was avoiding once and again of the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not take decisively its dangerous here to its aim.
In general terms the passive made too much little for a retador, and it only tried to pass the rounds.
Although it was provoking to Klitschko with words and gestures its blows only rarely reached to the world champion.
However, he is now the second does, after Cheating Hoffmann in the 2000, which he held twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the battle, the retador had already caused a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
It had insulted to Klitschko as "horrible zombie", that "it does not know how to make anything".
When carrying out the weight, supplementary, the champion was let provoke on Friday to remove it to Johnson the sunglasses of the nose "to be able to see their eyes."
Fourth triumph after the return of
Also in its fourth free-for-all after its return on the 11th of October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a gap of almost four years, it beat to the Nigerian in that then in Berlin, and had recovered " its " belt of the WBC, which before it had to deliver without fighting.
That year it beat afterwards in its defenses of the bond to Juan Carlos Gómez, of Cuba, and in September to Chris Arreola, of the United States.
In this row only I received a blow, and am in very good physical condition, its rapid return to ring had explained Klitschko.
But their dream follows the important four titles all being to meet in their family.
His brother is a world champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
However the British belongs to the belt belongs to British belongs to the, that this dethroned in November Nikolai Valujev, of 2.13 meters of stature.
In the previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against in the stadium Wembley, of London.
The case
Frontal attack the opposition: the head of the group of the Greens, called the Minister of defence, Gutenberg deceitful, due to false information on the subject.
The SPD and the leftist ones require explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - After the most recent revelations on the air raid of Kunduz, the opposition has reproached it to the minister for defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), to have tricked knowing facts.
In the broadcast of news " Tagesschau " of on Saturday, transmitted by the ard TV channel, the head of the group of the Greens, said that the minister "knowingly had not said the truth" on the murderous bombing of two convoys.
In a case, it is normally said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have occurred without taking the rules of the international force of protection into account for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that had the NATO, and that has read Mr. Gutenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday had been introduced that in this attack not only it was dealt of destroying the kidnapped trucks, but also of killing two leaders Taliban deliberately.
In the air raid of the United States, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, the colonel Klein, according to the report of the committee of Inquiry of NATO, they died or until 142 people were injured.
The greens, the SPD and the left exhorted on Saturday the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to pronounce himself immediately before the federal parliament and to rinse what Gutenberg really knew on the incident.
Mrs. Merkel has to clarify if a strategy of the deliberate murder belongs to the policy of Afghanistan of the federal government, and if the chancellery, the army and the service of information have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens demanded Renate Künast.
The spokesman of the government, Ulrich Wilhelm, rejected the criticism decidedly.
The chancellery did not exert any influence on specific actions of the German army in, said.
On Saturday doubts had also spread on the presentation that the Ministry did on the motifs of the dismissal of the general inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of.
According to information from the, both had informed to Gutenberg correct and completely on the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of the reports of NATO and they had concealed sensitive details from to the minister.
However, from the environment of the two senior officials it spread that they even had indicated to the Ministry of Defense the existence of several reports, among them a document of two pages of Colonel, the one who was in command, and a report of a patrol of field.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have requested in a card that is clarified the matter, brings the journal "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far has not received response, was said.
The ministry did not demonstrate on Saturday with regard to the reproaches that are done to him, and indicated that this would become clear in the commission of investigation of the Federal Parliament, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Oneiric worlds
In a state of vigilance some people see images and hear voices that others do not see nor hear.
Not only in the case of the mental ill ones and in drug addicts the limits between fantasy and the reality fade away.
As long as it happens during the dream, everything is in order.
When we are laid down in our dark rooms with the closed eyes, we can turn ourselves in without hindrance to the most savage imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, the one who experiences states similar to the dream during the vigil, or sees and hears things that others do not see nor hear, is considered most of the times in the modern occidental world as insane or drug addict, or at least as maniacal.
But such images and voices not only they rise in the mental ill ones or in the drugged ones.
Our imagination has The blame lies: the same neuronic processes that allow us to design houses, to paint pictures or to write novels, on sometimes make the limits among the dream, the madness and the reality blur.
The states of alert conscience oníricamente modified can appear in the most diverse ways, in the best of the cases we call them visions, and in the worst, madness.
Even if the system and the effects can be distinguished similar processes can be referred the visions of mystical vision the von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the prophet of the new era, the states of chamánica possession, and the psychoses and hallucinations.
The hallucinations or the mania rise when itself has descarrillado the balance of the neuronic substances of communication in the brain -especially the dopamina, the noradrenalin, the serotonin and the acetylcholine- and the interaction is disturbed among different parts of it.
During a very often appear schizophrenic psychosis hallucinations complex and thoughts gone mad appear.
The seriousness it no longer does not have power on it
The relation between madness and dream has occupied the philosophers and doctors from the former era.
Aristotle conceived the hallucinations as a form of the dream in a state of wakefulness, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, confirmed in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness to the oneiric states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream even was "a psychosis, with all the outrages, crazy formations, and mirages of this."
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. is converted in a figure of comic.
Their bodies is of two dimensions and scandalously colourful.
The seriousness it no longer does not have power on it, is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind it, figures of demons with wings, with red grimaces as blood, deformed, the teeth squeaking.
They are chasing it, kick it with heavy with shoes and flameantes, throw it against the walls, he sits the pains in the whole body.
Strident voices and malignant resound from the walls and the radio.
Any longer it can not hold them, the voices that insult it and offend.
Henning T. pulls two cables of the stereo, moors them to form a knot of hanged, and fixes them in a punch in the ceiling.
He gets on in a horn and the knot sets around the neck.
It jumps.
The path loosens up.
What serves you of lesson!, shout out the voices in a chorus that bursts the eardrums for her, "it sees to the private hospital and do that they cure you!"
Now, Henning T. has 40 years and has experienced six psychosis acute, the last one two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that caused it was the LSD.
Its diagnosis is psychosis esquizo - affective - paranoide, besides it is manic-depressive, takes medicines, decision-making, against depression, the bad habit, the schizophrenia.
It has learned to live with their illness, since three years ago it is married.
In hysteria in the I have experienced the hysteria in the most terrible anguish and deepest despair, says.
The hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one per cent of the population falls ill once in the life of schizophrenia at least; in the psychiatric private hospitals it the trade as the second most frequent illness after the depression.
In a schizophrenic psychosis acute, most of the time the ones affected already can not distinguish between the outside world and the interior, and they fall in a state of overexcitation that it can drive to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, disorders in the relationship, or been targeted.
Especially extended is found hearing voices: voices that give orders, comment or they talk.
The optical hallucinations are also frequent.
The one affected already is not capable of distinguishing what is important of what is not it, the brain any longer can not filter Disturbing signals, the conscience is seen flooded of views.
As the dream, also the psychosis opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that originate from the poorer deep conscience.
The perception of the reality in the psychosis is centered in the subject, the professor says Thomas Fuchs, head doctor of the private hospital of general psychiatry of the university hospital.
The schizophrenic one is in the heart of the events, everything has a meaning directed to it.
At the same time it enters a passive role, as in a dream, it feels overwhelmed by the events and it can not organize them actively.
It is because of that the schizophrenic ones feel frequently threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust the reality to them, the hallucinations are a cruel impossible reality being aroused.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
On the contrary that in a dream, it says Fuchs, "the space and sensorial structure of the reality that is perceived in the psychosis remain in principle as it is."
The thoughts paranoid and the hallucinations are based on the reality, the distanced of the experience takes place in the reality.
For the investigators still an unknown factor the why our brains does unfortunate mishaps.
According to Fuchs the states of exception can take any person to lose touch with reality in a temporary way.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
Apparently there is a genetic provision for the schizophrenia, but in twins studies have proved that besides the genes there are also other key determinants.
The investigators suppose that the affected ones suffer minimum cerebral damages.
We suspect that the maturity of the brain neural is seen affected in an early stadium of the development, as for example through a viral illness of the mother during pregnancy, it explains Fuchs.
But it keeps being be seen how that alteration of the neuronic system, which besides does not appear at all during many years, takes place.
The influence of environment also plays an important paper - the stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers a psychosis when there is already a prior provision.
In the same way, the hallucinogenic drugs can provoke a psychosis, since they interfere in the transmitting system of the brain.
When the brain warms up
What is illogical of all this is that the psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive medicines to be released from them, whereas others pay for drugs that allow them to experiment on some, the professor in psychology says Erich Kasten, of Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as nice or does not depend frequently on the point of view.
Kasten compiles since last year ago on hallucinations and visions and irreale Welt has analyzed the results in the White Paper un unserem Kopf (the world unrealistic in our head), published ten years ago reports.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms accompanying of the psychoses, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them they find also illnesses as headache tablet, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer and craneoencefálicos traumatisms, beside psychic disorders as the limit disorder of the personality or the Depression, frequently.
Surprisingly and in specific conditions the brains of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to, are composed by memories that normally are repressed.
They rise up when the areas of the brain in which the sensorial perceptions are processed are hyperactive or are little shy; when our brain warms up, but also when incentives are lacking.
The drugs can provoke this state in the same way as the brain damage or a psychosis.
But also the restriction of incentives, the stress, the sentiments of or brain or other states of exception.
UN jüngeren Studien gab bis zu a Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens, einmal im Leben to Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. Tenía 16 years, lived in a small town of and went to a college of higher education.
An ordinary girl.
If it were not for these pictures and the voices.
Sometimes, during the enjoyment, it happens that a boy clumsy with hair long dark and addresses him the floor.
When it answers it the other pupils look it soprendidos; nobody, to part of it, hears or sees the boy.
They think that the shy girl is an a little strange ensoñadora, but Sarah K. Sabe that it is not dreaming.
It is awake and it sees and it hears that boy, in the same way that sees and hears the boy in the Bank.
It can feel even its presence, at least some moments.
It is a feeling, it likes the boy.
Sometimes he wonders whether it is crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of visions are not real and disappear.
For the evenings, the appearances are alarming.
The visions are frequently a burden.
When it is in kind sometimes the lesson can not continue because the professor - to their eyes and ears - is introducing a new colleague, whereas for the rest it explains the mathematical equations in a visible and audible way.
For the evenings, the appearances are alarming.
While it waits in the dark room to which it arrives the dream, which many times arrives late and is scarce, does not know how to distinguish if it is awake or dreaming, if the images that sees, the grimaces or the girl with bleeding cuts in the arms and legs, appear in front of its open or closed eyes.
Leave me in peace, shouts at the figures.
To Their parents and friends it has not had them at all, would think that it is crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. Tiene hoy20 years.
He approved last year selectivity and lives with their boyfriend.
Does a year that the hallucinations have disappeared.
Since it has gotten in contact across Internet with the psychologist, it knows that it is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art for despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is isolated socially or suffers restriction of incentives, it is very probable that after a time it starts to have hallucinations.
I think that the brain finds emptied yse orders the same one of entertainment being looked for.
Sarah K., daughter, had only, had of small fear of the other children and often played alone.
Their hallucinations started when, with 13 years, he found out about the man to the one that he calls father since it has use of reason not being his father.
Since the hallucinations visual noise and are active in the same areas of the brain that real impressions and noise also process, to the ones affected as Sarah K. he it is difficult to distinguish between dreams and reality. "Every experience", says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, the situation is projected there.
The hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, that's why they seem so real."
Kasten also classifies the nocturnal fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not stand out in what is basic of those of a psychosis acute.
On the contrary that the schizophrenic ones, healthy psychologically, people are capable of recognizing their visions as unreal.
Kasten recommends because of that their hallucinations as a special skills to its patients that they appreciate.
Limit situation between dream and hallucination
In this world too much centered in what is conscious imaginary experiences are aware, the tend as a rule patologizarse, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, head of department in Heidelberg and head doctor of the private hospital of psychiatry and psychotherapy of the hospital Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is an illness hard and distressing but that also entails something positive and creative - the madness is a work of art of the despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the called oneirismo a special form of conscience, that is perceived as if it were a dream.
The oneiric hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that later it can not differentiate of the to be awake.
The oneiric conscious states rise in extreme situations associated to a trauma or a disease, as for example in patient with polirradiculoneuropatía, who experience a motor paralysis being completely conscious. die EIB vollem Bewusstsein to motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a leak of one or of the world because of a total and permanent driving inability, this replaces a real situation very dangerous by an own and imaginary world that is disconnected of the reality.
A form of limit situation between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to surpass a situation in the reality a world of change takes place, although the real situation follows present in the imagination.
An intensive form of giving sense and interpretation to an intolerable situation in itself that our own capacity of creation allows us not to sink us in the nothing of the loss of awareness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
Also the historian of art Peter Cornelius Claussen, of Zurich, describes its oneiric experiences in its book Herzenwechsel as an action of rescue of the soul.
It had 49 years, when your conscience was embarked on journeys of several days after an operation of the heart valves with transplant of included heart, while its body was condemned to the immobility in the intensive care.
Claussen was submerged in a world created by it and visited places of other strange saw an older man prostrated in bed on board a sanatorium in a train, a robot watched over their health.
It was seen in the Middle Ages, surrounded with noblemen who produced drugs from blood.
A Greek on a motorbike kidnapped it in their country of origin, did surfing on its bed of hospital in the with firn snow and ran into a Korean member of the mafia.
It gives it everything in these facts imaginary, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these interioresson journeys fundamentally different to any dream.
To dream is a different state, describes like this their experience.
On the contrary the memories of the mental travel are, many years afterwards, much clearer, even in the minor details.
Clearer and intensive even that actual experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilute the horizon of the rest of our day-to-day experiences, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, the oneirismo, the psychoses, hallucinations and consumption of drugs show how fragile internal reproduction of reality outside is, even when we are awake.
Every modification of the state of conscience, summarizes the psychologist, "can take to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.

Coarse
The children will see about the editorial with 27 years
The new editor Kallen has arrived to a temporary solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave its business in the future in the hands of his two children, commented on SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding company will pass to be also in the hands of the family.
Hamburg - the publisher sees its company in the hands of their children in the future.
The two children are converted in heirs with 27 years and have the firm will of entering in the company, confirmed Coarse, of 69 years, SPIEGEL.
The details have been fixed as precautionary measure.
The following that is questioned is if they will share active way in the company.
Also, if they are enabled for that.
One can not put their children in front of 7 500 workers, if they are not enabled for that enough.
That would finish with the children and also with the company.
Coarse gave to know the Thursday that will be withdrawn from January of the presidency of the Management Board and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been named his successor.
This member of the family Kallen, of 52 is from 1999 member of the direction of Coarse.
In a start it was responsible for the technology.
Later, he was in charge of the treasury and with that the responsibility arrived on the heritage of the company. After the departure of he also saw about the direct marketing, the foreigner, impression and finance.
For first time no member of the family occupies the apex of the editorial.
The children of Coarse have 19 and 17 years. Its son Felix, who at present it would have 42 years, died a few years ago.
The appointment of also serves for, " to overcome the differences of 10 15 years," as Coarse.
100% of the holding company will pass to be also in the hands of the family.
With the look put on the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffle, Coarse appeared that family businesses are not either safe and sound of the decline: "This has always affected families that are let be contagious for the eagerness for search of capital, that they have judged badly and they thought that they could raise as well as the largest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I have never had " delusions of grandeur, states Coarse.
I do not see myself as a political tutor of this country, as Springer was, and I do not want to play with the " Time " in the business world League either; business world League; these have been made too big.
The promise of
Peek is extremely, a device that only serves for looking the possibility of mail, limited without possibility at least of seeing some kind of attached or sailing for to the net.
It enjoyed five minutes of its reputation in USA. when the magazine Time named it one of the products of the year.
To see it through the street is more difficult the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less of half of what is paid, for example, for the plan of data of the iPhone.
The success seen the company has taken two new measures: one exclusively thought for Twitter, the other one with a free service of data forever in exchange for paying six times more for the.
FonPeek, presented yesterday in the event, is the European version of the invention and its third encarnaciónn.
It is just as limited as its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The price of monthly maintenance, of about 12 euros per month, includes the roaming through all Europe.
Those who already travel with a smartphones know that it is which the border to have to renounce the data when it crosses or to look desperately for a café with WiFi (or a connection of) for to be able to consult the post.
The idea about a roaming to fixed price is incredibly attractive and does time that should be in operation.
Yes some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience a doctorate in physics to understand them and some good glasses to read the small print is necessary.
The repeated pulls of ears of the European Commission hardly to achieve fees of affordable roaming tariffs for the whole have had a perceptible effect.
Out of the country of origin there is fear to use the data, and with rightly so.
That an aparatito as FonPeek (it does not stop resulting curious from Fon that it takes the name when it lacks Wifi) obtains this type of tariffs means that the operators start to think in a different way and study different proposals with which to redeem its network of data.
Kindle is another good example, includes the traffic of unloading of books and other consultations on the Internet.
Without contracts and without bagpipes.
It is a connected device and is paid because of that when buying it not to buy, month by month.
And that is what I expect to see some day with, a call option with access forever as the one that Peek already has in USA.
Not because it is going to buy it.
I look at my mail in the telephone, thank you.
I wait it because I think that it is a model more exactly for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
The yellow is, undoubtedly, the pitch preferred of the first lady preferred us.
If it already went to the taking over of Barack Obama as president of US with a clothing and a cover of this colour, has chosen it to accompany it in, undoubtedly the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has taken a very similar model on the two occasions: besides being a similar colour -yellow greenish with bright reflections-, both times the facade was composed by three parts -dress, jacket and coat of the same cloth-, and was adorned with a big embroidery or shackles.
So much is like this, that in a first glance it seemed that the first lady of followed the trail of the Princess of and had opted to repeat vestaurio.
But the cloth in which they are ready-made makes the two costumes very different.
If for the taking over of dealt of a fat, fit, in Oslo it is a velvet with currently.
The complements have also varied: green shoes of half a heel the again, and a similar model, but in browned, now.
Different and also is the hair style: one collected on this occasion, long hair releases the previous one.
75% of working mothers has had Labour has had problems through its maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for the women of younger generations that they want to be mothers.
Like this the study 'Fertility and work trajectory of the women in Spain', elaborated by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of women, reveals it.
The enquiry carried out among 9.737 women from 15 to 75 years does not leave doubt about this: 75% of working mothers has seen the opportunities limited in the field of work because of motherhood.
The study notes that there are many differences in the beginning of the communal life in couples and the number of children, according to whether they work or not and of the type of work that develop.
The ones that do not have an activity out of the home, work at intermediate time, or have a job, not begin before stable, initiate before the communal life in couples, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary women with stable employment, mainly in public sector, defer the communal life and the maternity, and have less offspring.
"The women of between 35 and 49 years with permanent work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after initiating the start of coexistence, cipher that increases to 4.1 women with permanent jobs have needed more time of its vital trajectory to obtain them, what has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of the children.
Besides, the type of had work exerts great influence on motherhood although less on the calendar of the pairing", explains the investigator of the Thin margarita CSIC.
The level of studies is another of the factors that the age of women differentiates when getting married and when having the first offspring.
According to the enquiry, as much as old it is the level of education, bigger is the age to which they are married and to which they have the first child.
The difference keeps also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group of between 35 and 49 years, those that have elemental and superior studies have been mothers for the first time to the 25,1 and 32,1 of media respectively.
Another division between women is established besides according to their qualifications.
Whereas those that have basic training get married and have their first child before obtaining a stable employment, those of higher levels of means or invert this sequence and prioritize the achievement of a stable work as condition prior to marriage and to the arrival of a child ", details Thin.
Diane Kruger also costs it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envied list of global ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be converted in image of different products of mark, the, singing the universal motto of 'Because I cost it'.

Prizes of British fashion
The British have a lot that to say in the world.
Its tallest representatives -designers and models, of yesterday and of today- were brought together in the annual delivery of its prizes, which were celebrated in London, in the Royal Court you Justice.
The appointment did not lack anybody.
The ex model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chosen Better Model of the year.
The poker game of
Manuel Vicent gives away thirty X-rays of writers who have passed by their lives literary (and, in cases, also for the other one) in 'Poker of ace ' (Alfaguara illustrations of) .
He does not make it in the genders foreseeable and fearsome (biographical sketch, life and work), but looking for something similar to the kernel of ignition of the creative character.
The journey has its excitements and Vicent does not save scares or lightings.
Besides a delicacy pleasure the Green Paper is a touching invitation to readings and rereadings.
Here I leave them some scope.
On Albert Camus: On its pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a physical and spiritual tendency, almost, the same one that I felt without being named after by it: pleasing against the black destination, the blameless morality and innocence and without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilistic, allegorical Christian, wrote what had in the blood, not in the intellect, between the impotence and the ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, as the leaf of the knife that was about to kill him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man remained abducido for this woman with a passion that a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching the sky across the path of damnation lasted thirteen years, in whose meat it combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse."
On James Joyce: " the ' Ulises ' was published in Paris by Sylvia Beach in 1922. It is one of the summits of eight thousand meters of the universal literature, which has to be climbed for the Wall from the north, from which the best climbers are hurled once and again."
On William Faulkner: "It was a strange type.
Of itself, some times he said that he was an heir of a landowner county Council and others who was a son of a black one and of a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer comprised the cry demented thrown since a bridge by that character of Munich to take its echo up to the bottom of the night of 20th century under your way literary and did it in a journey running away of itself and invoking to the posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
On Dorothy Parker: " one day was made of its knees and he prayed: 'God dear, I would ask te that you do that it stops writing as a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these words of were recorded: 'The dream after the effort, / following the storm the puerto,/ the rest after the guerra,/ after the life full pleases the death."
On Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage it also brought their depression.
The husband accepted with every normality that she told him that Eduardo VII spied on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
Never itself has if necessary of such a man patient and fallen in love of one neurotic whose talent neurotic literary went in front of their madness."
On Cheep Baroja: "What did Martín - Saints but to try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What tried Benet but to happen to Baroja for weapons of?
What did Cela but abducir the reputation of that man so that it acted it as own pedestal?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother of some 70 years of age walked for our neighborhood in the municipality of when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years passed beside it and to our dog, a copy of race mongrel, rescued from the dog pound and with no more than six kilos and, without mediating word, two kicks that left gave the dog injured badly to her.
Our indignation is capital because we do not find the fun in a free aggression to a small and helpless animal, which by the way, was tied.
This has to be added to the suffocating impact that it provoked it to a woman that walked calmly and that, when it rebuked these individuals, it got to fear for their physical integrity, since a lunatic that attacks to an animal, is capable of doing the necessary with a Lady who 75-year-old man was upbraided calmly an old man or, all in all, with any that it is weaker than it.
The event happened at five in the afternoon of a Tuesday anyone by a district traditionally calm.
The dog was crying over all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a near police station that we doubt that it serves for a lot and not to generate sensitivities, only to clarify that the Spanish were cowardly murderers were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among the youngsters so that they consider it amusing to ill-treat freely a helpless animal that gives us affection, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and the respect to the animals and to the people have stayed.
Michelin and Fesvial joint by the use of the Hull
The manufacturer of tires Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for the Road Safety (Fesvial), has started off a campaign to encourage the use of the Hull, mainly among motorcyclists more young people, informed today both entities.
This initiative seeks to make aware on the importance of using the Hull, since they are the only element of protection capable of avoiding injury in the head or, even, the death in the case of suffering an accident while it is circulated in motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of its appointment with the road safety, which "goes apart from designing and more insurances fabricating products every day" and stated that it also contributes to this goal through other actions of educational and informative.
This new campaign of promotion of the use of the Hull in the motorcycle, under the slogan be or not to be or not to be, will have a first phase in which posters in more than 500 workshops of motorcycles will be distributed, with the aim of achieving the maximum broadcasting.
To finish, Michelin stood out that road safety "is a constant concern for the company, since when being a manufacturer of Tyre for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main purpose is to develop increasingly safe products.
It raises the sale of light commercial ones
Almost two years afterwards the light commercial vehicles market starts to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9.425 units that were registered in November in represent an increase of with regard to 2008 and, what is more important, mean the first increase after 22 consecutive months of descents, according to ciphers of the employers of the manufacturers Anfac and of that of vendors Ganvam.
The good thing, not osbtante, agrees on putting it in hold since the reference with those that are done by the comparison -November of 2008- was particularly bad, with a descent from 60% with regard to the previous year.
Consequence of that is that, in spite of the resumption of the last month, the registrations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January 95.853 units have been sold added all the vehicles that compose the drawer of tailor of the light commercial ones: derivatives from cars, pick up, vans, light vans and light trucks / chassis.
Likewise, the storm clouds have not disappeared that affect their demand more, for although they are also acquired by private individuals, most of the purchases are carried out by small and medium companies, which they pay almost by 100% of cases through external funding.
So, other factors as the increase in the levels of unemployment or the persistence of the poor economic situation has to be added to the restrictions that the closed faucet of bank loans means.
In the face of this background and unlike the tourisms, of little the helps to the purchase of the have acted.
To them the autonomous ones and the pymes that are going to acquire can resort, besides the individuals, one commercial light of up to 3,5 tons with a level of broadcasts of CO2 that does not surpass 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been testimonial.
Just yesterday, from Ganvam they remembered the need to dedicate to these vehicles and also to the industrialists (lorries and buses) particular attention on the part of the administration again.
The Association of sellers predicts one 2010 similar to the year that finishes, for the one that calculates a fall in the sales (of cars and 4 x 4) of 19%.
The help to the stopped emergency one is already obligatory
As it happened with the anti blocking of brakes ABS and will pass with the control of stability ESP, the systems of help to the stopped emergency one will have to be a compulsory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles of new registration, whereas for the rest it is fixed an elimination period up to ends of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, has it as aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, for its way of working, it can also help avoid many collisions for scope.
The assistant to the stopped emergency one what does is to increase the pressure on the brakes in the event of an urgency, which the system detects for the stamp that gives the driver.
But this not always maintains this pressure up to the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of car components for car Bosch, the third part of the drivers implicated in an accident had not gotten to tread on the brakes before the collision and half of them did not make use of the full force.
Accidents up to 1.100
The intervention of the aid, however, requires the maximum to the system of stopped, reducing the distance that uses the car in stopping.
According to a study of the EU itself, if all the cars were equipped with this type of elements, fatal injuries up to 1.100 in which implicated pedestrians are seen could be saved a year.
The even greater reductions will be still bigger -it is calculated that they would be avoided one of every four accidents with damage to people- when the ones called system intelligent of stopped emergency are popularized.
In this case the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a house) detects the obstacles and warns the driver, besides acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps it increasing the pressure on the pedal, if it is necessary.
If it does not react, and even if the collision is unavoidable, the mechanism exerts maximum effort to the obstacles to minimize the damage.
General Motors defers until January the plan for Opel
Whereas the workers of the plant of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been told by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new will be initiated in the first week of April -on the 8th probably- as it informs Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that is going to need more time to conclude the recovery plan for Opel.
What intends Nick Reilly the new president of Europe, is that each of the points in the plan has been agreed on previously by the affected part.
And this can make the definite document that will be submitted to the workers first and afterwards to the Governments of the countries in which there are factories, be late up to the beginning of 2010.
However, from GM it is assured that a decision on the sale of should be taken on the next few days.
To this is not strange the that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the American manufacturer so that it takes a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of sports cars, who is backed up by the Russian group Converg, gathers strength.
If there was not agreement with any of them, GM could sell some assets of Saab to the Chinese Baic.
The decision of closing Saab in order to year if it be not bandaged keeps.
To At the wheel of the
For desarrolar his finalizes, and expensive jewel, engineers of took the Boxster S as basis and managed that less than 80 kilos lost weight at all, which has left the scale in only 1.275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, in the first place, with the automatic ceiling that has been made up by one of canvas with saved manual, so they save themselves 21 kilos; using doors of aluminum as those of the, another 15 ' fall '; taking away the air control unit, 13; reducing the deposit of fuel of 64 at 54 litres, they were gained 7 kg more; getting on sport bacquets another 12 and with the other 12 light no 19 inches, five.
Finally, to renounce the system of audio contributed other six kilograms and changing the handles of the doors for some of kilo of, the question remains.
Although PDK of double clutch is also offered with change with the test was carried out on a unit with the manual box of six speeds, mainly for secondary roads of, in sections of mountain with routes really twisted
Their behaviour can only be qualified as irreproachable one.
The reduction of weight does not imply that the car does not tread on the asphalt with aplomb.
Rather, on the contrary: did time that we did not test a model that was so small and slight that, the time, transmitted such certainty in the crossing for curve, even at higher speeds.
A small athlete is, capable of warming up their muscles in a short course during the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, which it stops, which it recovers and he squeezes its engine again...
What we ask it for. Thanks to its direction as forthcoming as precise, what we indicate with our hands in the wheel is what the car will make.
And he will make it with a surgical accuracy.
The engine noise at will
The sound of its bóxer V6, with 320 horses (10 more that the Boxster S) is very achieved and can be promoted with the option ' sport ' and through a system that modifies the bellow of the engine, already used for the first time beforehand in the Panamera.
The ability of acceleration is brutal, either from a halt or in recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads across which we go with the Boxster Spyder was quite a lot punished, but the car digested the potholes well.
Electronic aid were hardly made act of presence in the whole journey; and what in one of the bends we find ice at dawn and gravel, already well the future entered.
All in all, an ultralight car, of the most amusing of driving that one can in the market and that is a little more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will set on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70.831 euros.

A victory is given away by the Baskonia in Israel
The Box Work-Related managed a shining triumph for 82 - 91 in his visit to the complicated court of the, in spite of the numerous casualties with which it had team of the, and this way it is situated in the lead of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples written down was the best of its equipment (29 of assessment) .
The vitoriano equipment knew how to make up for the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Market Gardens or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work although it had to suffer until the end to be made with the victory.
Besides the great skill since the perimeter, with 16 triples written down had a lot to see in the final victory.
The party started in front for the azulgranas, who set from the outset ahead in the scoreboard.
That the four first baskets of the vitorianos were from the perimeter made to presage that they had jumped to the Israeli court with the hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main creators of the 18 - 20 in the end of the first partial.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the alavés equipment opted for the interior game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received with whistles and applauses in the return to the one that was their home, to keep extending its advantage to the rest (34 - 43) .
Teletovic already started to be highlighted as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'less six' of assessment of they already did to presage that this was not going to be the best night of Brazilian.
But the match, despite being gotten to the rest on the rails, was not decided not even a lot less and the macabeos wanted to remember the vitorianos that in its scope he does not gain any, and with 'the hand of Elías' being tight they managed to enter the party.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively the luminous one (50 - 49) towards the ' yellows ' turning round.
More disadvantages
Those of Ivanovic, wounded but not even a lot less dead, needed to spin a couple of time you bet with success to catch air, and in those the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three consecutive almost three-fold and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a soothing income (54 - 67) , which they managed to put make-up the local at the end of the third quarter (57 - 67) , arrived.
The alaveses went out the skin to be left in the partial last one and English and San Emeterio (60 - 75) already warned that they were not going to leave that anybody took away what had deserved during the first thirty minutes from them.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of his team were not handed over and tried to maintain his team with life from the line of three points (70 - 77) .
In spite of that, and with Splitter eliminated by mistakes, those of Ivanovic were not precipitated, defended well, and although the Israelis were approached in the final minute (80-85), the party already had owner and the victory escaped of Tel Aviv for first in the season.
The battle to prevent injury prevent the Unicaja from giving battle
The Unicaja lost soundly in Greece in front of the Olympiacos and yielded B of the Euroleague, in a match marked by the casualties of the typesetters, him the leadership of the group especially in the interior game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The malagueño equipment was not frightened through the atmosphere of the pavilion of the Peace and the Friendship and either for the body of rival, maybe of the most powerful of Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. A defence and aggressive and three consecutive triple, two of the base Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio, was dazzling to local to the 12 - 18 minute 9.
The Olympiacos was seen surprised by the intensity of the, although the arsenal of the sites in internal game with, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned it round to the marker 22 - 20 minute 13 when in which an action signs of wrangling, between both American bases and Williams, meant the disqualification of both players.
The Greek whole started to work showing its superiority in both areas, where the decrease for injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal errors of, were weighing down the typesetters.

Thank you very much
After on the days of wine and roses since last spring in which the inflation of asset has been the dominant tonic in the markets the uncertainty again reappears in the markets, which must not miss since it is their natural state, in an environment in which the players take decisions around the future by nature uncertain.
The medicine used by the central banks to stabilize the markets was to monetizar debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving free drinks of liquidity to close to zero rates so that financial institutions bought active to take away.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct buying of assets has practically finished and, without questioning their liquidity heterodox policy, start to throw something of on the wheels how it made the ECB with their auction at year of the next week.
Therefore, the investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain the economic recovery without very unorthodox measures and we are attending a reversion of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock markets and corporate bond differentials have turned pick up again over, although they are still very far from the paranormal levels that they reached at the beginning of year.
The states were seen obliged to socializing private risk and the national debt is seen affected again.
Again there is a flight to the quality and US, Japan and Germany have been the shelter chosen by the investors, provoking an enlargement of the differentials of in the countries of the eurozone with regard to Germany.
Spain had hardly been seen affected by this episode of instability but in that arrived Standard & Poor's and threatened a new falling revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not come badly to silence the defenders of the moral hazard that tried again to create office to create awareness on the ones responsible for the global economic policy for having stopped the destructive effects derived from the lack of credit on the destruction of employment, when the that it should be done is to decree a new day of action of thanks.
However, that of pint Dubai to a tribal fight among the emirs to recompose the power in the Arab and that of Greece we have already seen it before.
A Government that conceals public deficit, elections and a new Government that he throws itself from the blanket.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It does not have sense that the Ecofin saved Hungary from a breach of their external payments at the beginning of year and that it is going to allow a member country of the euro to break its commitments.
What yes has logic is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens of the need for special measures corresponsables to maintain the stability of public finances.
If we find, how we wait, ourselves in front of an episode of normalization of risk premiums temporary, after some excesses in positions levered up, it would be in what had been waited for.
In the case of Spain, as long as our differences of public debt extend as the European corporate bond we must not worry.
If the decline and our European differentials decrease and ours keep extending, risk would then be dealt of by Spanish idiosyncratic issue.
The of Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advance indicators are obliging to the majority of services of studies to anticipate their situations of recovery and to revise upward its scenario for 2011, the OCDE included and the European Commission, that they return to the Japanese scenario with a burden for the Spanish economy does not foresee much life expectancy to your comment.
Again, it has all the pint that will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment " caution, conducting friend".

For the president, Spain needs to invert eur 50 billion by 2020 and some other 60.000 million between that date and 2030, as long as they keep nuclear power stations opened today in operation.
Of not being like this, the necessary investments will not be of 60 000 million, but of up to 95 million.
That yes, Iberdrola considers that in the next decade the inversions must not be destined to increase the capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and in international interconnections

Its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues works dispute
It works fights for its first highway in concession in Australia, market in which it already works as company managing energy and water.
At stake is the work is that of a tunnel valued at 1.700 million Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
The Frenchwoman Bouygues and the German are its rivals.
A tunnel of 5 kilometers in the Australian city of on the East Coast, has turned into the nearest option so that Acciona settles in the country as building and concessionary of motorways.

The Australian market promise major infrastructure promises major infrastructure works and privatisations, but it entails a clear difficulty of entry if it is not through the acquisition of a local signing of construction.
A strategy that the mentioned Hochtief or Bilfinger have followed, besides references in Asia, and that continues being unresolved issue for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS has hardly achieved a position in that market through its participation of 30% in Hochtief, owner of the mentioned Leighton.

Staking the Champions has brought 476,4 million to at the and to the Barça from its origin
The League of Champions has become a source of income for the clubs since it appeared in 1992.
So much, that Real Madrid and Barcelona have deposited 476,4 million since then, what converts them in the third and fifth club that more money have gained in the competition.
The leading one of the list is Manchester United.
The leading one of the list is Manchester United.
Gaining the League of Champions of the UEFA not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue from the large clubs.
So much is like this, that the competition has divided up 5.362,5 million euros to the 105 equipments (12 of them Spanish) who have taken part in the event since the competition was created in the season 1992 / 1993, according to data from UEFA.
The Real and the F. C. Barcelona have gone out well stopped of this distribution.
The white club has been the third of the continent that more money has pocketed because he takes part, and the only one, beside the AC Milan, which has won three times the trophy.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct Glass of Europe in 1992, is the fifth of the classification.
The list lead it Manchester United and the Bayern of Múnich, the two teams that, besides, more money billed for the last League of Champions taking part.
And that, despite losing both in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that more money has achieved through the Champions, despite having achieved more bonds than any other one (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated procedure of distribution of money that the UEFA applies.
For this exercise, the organism that presides Michel Platini foresees to deposit 1 090 million through the Champions League.
Of this money the UEFA will dedicate 413,1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that took part in the first round of classification (among them the Atlético of Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Besides, those that managed to take part received 3.8 million because they were there, besides another 550.000 euros by every match that they play.
There is also bonus because it wins (800 000 euros) and because it draws (400.000 for each team) . The octavofinalistas will perceive three million each; the eight cuartofinalistas, 3.3 million.
The four last ones will pocket 4 million each.
The champion will gain 9 million, in front of the intervention of 5.2 million.
Thus, in concept of fixed in payments, a club will deposit at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31,2 million.
The Barça on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million for winning the Superglass of Europe in August.
But it is that besides the variable payments are, which 337,8 million are destined for.
This money is distributed according to the proportion of each television market value.
The Spanish is of the main ones, and has four assigned posts.
The champion of the previous year keeps 40% of the assigned money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other side will be paid according to the number of matches that they stake in this year.

It is a post of new creation that will depend directly on from the president of the group.
And it is not exempt from controversy, since the company is still immersed in the legal battle by the supposed detour of more than 230 million from Sos to societies of the.
In fact, it can not be discarded that throughout the next few months Sos reveals new misappropriations of funds

New tools to give an expert opinion on cars
In these days of temporary and accidents, not only gain workshops of cars.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a sinister are towed away until a workshop, where a qualified person must evaluate the damage and which will be the cost of repair.
Any sinister is equal, and the calculation of the costs of spare and time and the workforce can be a long and complicated work.
Calcularmanualmente the cost of compensation of between 20 000 and eur 30 000, including pieces ymano of work, it can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of the most recent information tools it would be deminutos question
That's why, almost 100% of the experts uses this type of system.
The suppliers of Service and solutions for appraisal of accidents and maintenance dedicate themselves to compiling the information that the manufacturers supply them with, for afterwards elaborating it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, it is the leading firm; 80% of the assessments gets of their products hold.
The other firms that compete in the field of the tools of evaluation and elaboration of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data that the manufacturers supply is very far from being simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez director of trade, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them supplies them with the information in different formats.
Besides, the quantity of data to deal does not stop increasing, to the point of which in the last five years themselves have lanzadomás versions, ymotorizaciones variants that in the fifteen previous ones.
As soon as a new car goes on the market, these companies start to work.
It is a very difficult task, because it has to be catalogued every one of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle and to introduce their price.
Besides, of each model an " intelligent " graphic image is carried out where different parts of tourism can "be pricked".
If he is a model of ventamasiva the work can be ready in a week if the process is very fast.
If it is a minor car, it can take three or four months. At present, Audatex has complete information on 99,2% of the cars that are marketed in Spain.
Among more exclusive losmodelos they have information on, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that circulates, they surpass 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and the drafting of databases, Audatex has eight centers distributed by the world (Spain, France, Germany, US, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in some specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technical (normally experts) (normally mechanical) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 billion per annum in elaborating these databases.
Every month 2.5 million data are included, and the customers receive updates every two days.
The drawing up of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and to offer varied products.
The most frequent use is centered in repair and maintenance, but in that according to which countries there are also tools for management of parts of scrapping or to calculate the sale value or waste of a car.
The only company that has a guide that it informs about the value of the ones used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but yes in United States.
In view of the products that Audatex offers it is easy to be done an idea about the type of support that they can give to those working in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the star product being star AudaPlus, the standard solution of appraisal of claims, stationed in the experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and or heavy and light commercial vehicles.
Besides the cost of the parts, it includes the times of repair estimated by the manufacturer or the standards of paint.

Afterwards every insurance company, which carries out thousands of expert appraisals, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as, allow the total identification of a vehicle and of the equipment with which it went out from the assembly line only with its number of frame.
AudaGlass concentrates on the screens of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is a service opened to the professional sector in internet that allows bidding by the vehicles declared total loss.
Their service of statistics is very useful to identify trends, to carry out geodemográficos analysis or to know the deviations for omodelos brands.
It can be studied, for example, how many models of certain brand they have passed through the workshop because of faults or how many have suffered serious accidents in a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated itself to the development of this type of tools.
He markets access to parts or prices and official times parts or prices and the manufacturer, among others, Gt Estimate, who also goes stationed in the experts and equally provides digital images.
Gt Motive is a company of the group founded in 1971 as supplier of services and solutions of assessment of damage, accidents or maintenance of the car

Auction for internet of hilly cars
In October last year the group bought Autoonline, a platform in internet for the sale of cars as of motorcycles or special vehicles victims.
The operation meant an outlay of 59,5 million euros for 85% of the asset of the society, which could be extended the year that it comes to the remaining 15%.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer their customers more value added services, with the possibility to enter an immense international market.
This service of assessment and sale addresses exclusively professionals of the sector, such as insurance companies, qualified persons, companies of rental, workshops, scrapping and professional vendors who must register themselves before starting to carry out operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650.000 operations in all Europe, 500.000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets they send Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The web counts at present on more than 1.500 registered vendors and 4 000 experts.
3 000 announcements are managed daily are managed and in the Spanish market around 100 new announcements are included every day.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose number of frame has been thrown out can not circulate again, but yes certain parts that are not damaged can be used as parts.
Yes Cars with historical value can be discharged from hospital even if they have been thrown out after a detailed efforts.
Budget of factory in Four steps
With the tool Auda-Taller, the company Audatex guarantees that the user obtains a budget in only four steps: identifying the vehicle, looking for the parts, creating budget and generating budget.
Ease of use is an essential prerequisite for these systems, especially to convince the professionals of more age, who in greater or lesser extent they are usually more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1.034 vehicles, which are 666 cars, 109 jeeps, motorcycles, 137, 78 44 vans and lorries.
Naturally, to use it is necessary a computer with Internet connection.
Once the model to repair through its number of frame has been identified a real graphic picture of the model appears in question and, afterwards, the necessary parts is selected.
The user can include variables as the price of the workforce, surcharges or discounts, and can print the budget afterwards to turn to the customer in.
AudaTaller is not a tool of assessment as AudaPlus, but rather a catalogue of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that the one orientated to at the workshop does not include times considered of labour.
The cost of use of this tool for the workshop is of 350 euros at the year, which the customer can finance.
At present the company is working so that these images are three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that the mechanics see with very favourably, since it will allow, for example, selecting a door and turning round for her to see the internal side.
