What it does? The ČSSD in Prague doesn't know neither Voldemort nor the pastry
The new Councillors of the ČSSD in the capital will have to overcome, it seems, language barriers obvious so the components of the Board of Prague and of the municipal Council will understand his renewed companions of ODS.
The period Aktuálně. cz "examined" the members of the new Council of the ČSSD to test their knowledge of the language marked slang that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when Prague ruled the current members of the coalition.
The encoded dictionary using the flower and political cream of Prague during the previous period, Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the characters, situations and causes more known of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, found that the new councillors almost do not understand those well-known concepts.
At least so they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is that I do not know."
"I rather am a novice in politics Prague," stated during the consideration of terminology of "colegueo" culture Lukáš Kaucký councilman.
And with regard to political veteran, reacted like Karel Březina.
Perhaps they know the "golf hole" concept.
"Possibly the only expression of all that I preguntasteis that I use from time to time."
"If not, usually not employment slang."
Glossary, whose definitions published the newspaper Aktuálně. cz last June before the Congress vote on the ODS, the wording chosen six examples, particularly those which are especially related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the concepts "voldemort," "greater hole golf in Prague," "go to the bakery," "Bull neck," "betrayal of the capital" and "shield."
Three councillors agreed to undergo the test and one-quarter, Antonín Weinert, which in future will be responsible for education in Prague, at first agreed, but did not return to pick up the phone.
The fifth Councillor, Petr Dolínek, directly refused to do so.
"I do not I get into these things or think assess how fun the civic Democrats."
"What I care about is how we understand in the implementation of our programmes," said.
As we have seen, supposedly Councilman Lukáš Kaucký not had realized that the previous title is an expression on an influential businessman and a friend of the senior Bém, Roman Janoušek.
Kaucký the word "voldemort" not told anything; the only term that was correct in the test is "the largest Prague golf hole."
"It's the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, which immediately adds: "But rather I know from the news."
"I'm going to have to point to a language course," he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only recognized in the golf the Blanka tunnel hole, but also the Councillor of environment Lukáš Plachý.
Later, both Democrat know who is actually Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find that character; In addition, suspected the meaning "to go to the bakery."
"I think that he means go to a company of Prague"; He soon reveals to Plachý that it is the headquarters of the companies of Janoušek.
Like Březina, indicates that such knowledge obtained them from the news, but that does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, there is not any familiar glossary of colloquial terms between the Democrat.
"I asked my colleagues, but it really seems that we do not have anything."
"Rather, between us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or make puns with the names," says the Chairman of the Prague ČSSD, Petr Hulínský, whose party colleagues call Hulda.
"At the College they called me Bříza, but I don't know if my colleagues I also so called," confesses his own nickname Karel Březina.
The newspaper Aktuálně. cz named test and it works.
His party colleagues, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less user-friendly, Dědek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom were associated before the election cheating during the sponsorship of the party, received the nickname of "igráček" ("playmobil") by some of his colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that the Democrat tolerate speech within the party.
Hulínský does not like to call him Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně. cz discovered even other nicknames for this President Prague.
"The doctor of the rights of the cheers" reportedly recalls that Petr Hulínský obtained his doctorate in law at the Academy of police in Bratislava.
The Government wants to limit the torture of "witches," as it was published in a brochure
Women as witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They tend to have an advanced age, they may not work, for example, for reasons of health, are single and have no children.
Women who "become" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not adversely affect the rest of the people.
"Men seldom suffer this fate."
"Not isolating the healthy young women, because they help in the work and have children," explains a nun that, in the capital of the West African State Burkina Faso occupies a special residence for more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local Government has decided to oppose this unusual "social action."
He issued a prospectus which should help to avoid witch hunts.
However, this has a downside.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso does not read," warns the newspaper Die Standard on the disadvantages of the awareness-raising in writing.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, last week died Nochee Hemmah, 72 years, when three women and two men her tortured, her covered in petrol and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to a unfortunate set of circumstances.
According to his version, women went up in the oil that is used for ritual anointings.
It went up in flames when the Group wanted to "expel the evil spirits" of women.
The isolation of "witches" supporting people at all educational levels.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted a businessman in 42 years of Burkina Faso: "the man-eaters of human souls always represented a danger," said.
While in Burkina Faso the Government attempts to appease the witch hunt, in the Gambia still last year participated in the President.
"The President Gambian Jammeh, after the death of her aunt, launched a wide the witch hunt that, supposedly, had been associated with his death and had attempted to kill the President himself through black magic."
"To help you brought to the nearby Guinea shamans that, protected by police, military and the personal bodyguard of the President, took the force men and women chosen randomly among the Gambian peoples to ownership of the President in Kanilai"the organization Amnesty International points out in his report.
On the farm, arrested persons had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects which, moreover, caused kidney and intestinal problems.
Two of those arrested did not survive the stay on the farm.
After international pressure, finally released some thousand persons detained.
The tenant of Bakala: heated with coal stoves and signs a higher rent
The man, of old age and recio, crossed the door of the Center's customer service of company RPG Byty "coal magnate" Zdeňek Bakala, the major owner private flats to rent in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm carrying a few documents with the new leases of three floors: yours, his daughter and his son, who is serving a sentence.
All three just them catch the liberalization of rents.
Rather than 3,500 CZK per month, son pay starting next year 4,100 Crowns for a floor of two rooms with separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, do not have hot water and heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," shows the finger man in the new contract of his son, whose firm has full powers.
"But I signed it," explains angry environment, resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new conditions of rent as "incorrect and indecent," recommends that tenants not to sign new contracts and to wait until December 7, the date which will publish a guide to report on how proceed in these cases.
But before this, the only man makes a gesture.
"Everyone says one thing," he says with bad side.
Ostrava is becoming a great liberalization test lab.
After new year it will happen with the vast majority of the flats in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rental.
For this reason, Aktuálně. cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The waiting room mining of RPG is one of the four of Ostrava and on Tuesday at nine, was already full.
Just next to the doors are security and to its side guards a machine to take number.
"Rent 2011," can be read on a bright touch screen button.
Press it, a piece of paper with a number leaves the machine.
Hardly enough time nor to read "157" and the number appears on the big screen in the top of the room.
In a second, you are in the queue.
Soon after, becomes a marriage of old age to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new rents.
The majority of the people comes to solve common problems, as formerly: applications for arrangements, insurance and similar matters.
Cards with the new leases will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of the tenants in most of the 44,000 belonging to RPG floors around the middle of November.
RPG Byty proposes in the letters to an increase in the rent of between 15% and 38%.
On 18 November opens a window in the center of attention to the customer for new rentals.
"Has been running a week, so it is beginning," they respond, after briefly, doubt the workers found it when the client is presented as a journalist.
Liberalization and old floors for miners of Bakala are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, already treated loud and clear the Vice President of the Parliament, originally from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, from the ČSSD, and now they appear continuously in the newspapers in the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new ground."
"And changed me the damn plate of the bathroom," was held the man mentioned in the introduction.
According to the workers, for the moment come mostly retirees to check if they receive a discount on the rent if they sign in time, as it promises the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants to sign the new contract before December 15 will receive also half of the discount on the rental of February.
However, the window of "liberalization" mining undoubtedly fails to dispel the avalanche of questions.
"360 Customer who were here yesterday, just asked to rent in 2011 around forty or fifty people," estimated the employee of the window.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on their boards have individual meetings on contracts where necessary.
If both parties do not reach an agreement on the rent, must solve the issue an independent judge.
"Is not a threat, but information on the only possible way and completely in accordance with the law," he warns RPG in its pages.
"Not here to judge anyone," believes one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man in the street in front of the center of attention to customer gives, at least in part, the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and I still have 5,000 for food;" "I have no means to go to court," he says.
But, immediately, employed sowing doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr Zaorálek advised in the media that did not sign, so perhaps the people wait," is of the view.
The regulation of the rental will cease to exist in the majority of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011, and RPG Byty, his rise as an economic necessity.
"The current rents still not cover even the necessary amounts for the maintenance of the Fund of the community," said Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of company RPG Byty, who adds that the neglected state of the Fund of the community that angry tenants is, for the owners, the main reason to raise the rent.
While during the five years that have elapsed between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to rent invest in apartments four billion, in the four years that Iran from 2011 to 2014 the number will increase to 5.2 billion.
The big screen hanging from the ceiling, with seats in the waiting room, now repeats some information highlighted in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, is say, more than 90% of the properties of RPG."
"In addition, will always be maximum 7.50 monthly CZK per square meter," is shown on the screen.
Only 38% increased the rent of 400 flats of the portfolio of RPG.
"In such cases, it's increased from quantities extremely low of 19,66 crowns per square meter," it indicates RPG.
In 2,600 flats, rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalization will not affect coup rentals, but that escalará between four to eight years.
Also adds the following pledge: the company will invest all the money in the rise of rent (see figure) again in the flats, mainly in savings in heating: new Windows and heating.
Priority will be given to people who sign the rise of rental agreement.
The architects have understood that the offices need childcare
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that it hides also inside a small nursery with own such facilities: walls of colors, creative furniture and even a miniature in the outdoor terrace Park.
Since October of last year, can go to the children of employees of Arch.Design.
The company's architectural projects Arch.Design, whose study came out many well-known buildings in Brno, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for your miniguardería.
In the company they work around 90 people, mainly in the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow that the architects and draughtsmen could return soon to work after motherhood.
Together with the possibility to enjoy a half day, day care is one of the benefits offered by Arch.Design to their workers in the framework of its social agenda.
Builders and architects in this way have the possibility of combining a profession demanding with the care of children.
The miniguardería was an idea of the own employees of Arch.Designu and, with the support of the direction, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of labour and Social Affairs.
The miniguardería of the company is financed by the European Social Fund within the framework of the operational programme human resources and employment, as well as the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Granted funding (an endowment of more than 2.8 million Czech Crowns) they could buy the equipment and, after two years, hiring qualified staff and services.
When it runs out of funding (two years), the Arch.Design company has an obligation to keep running the miniguardería with their own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and in the filing of the application of funding helped the Economy Rating company.
The care of children is in the hands of qualified personnel; In addition, are present throughout the day for their care a nurse and a teacher of the Ministry of education. The nursery currently welcomes children without age limit, although most of them have less than three years.
Given that it's a "miniguardería," only it can accommodate simultaneously to a maximum of five children, although with the shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the right to use the nursery, regardless of hierarchy within the company.
Although this is a teaching and individual care, the content of the programme of the miniguardería are comparable to regular pre-school education programme.
Her children not only play, but they also receive a quality education: from the basic learning until the preparation for the school, taught to English.
The class not only has toys and games table, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company create a friendly and positive atmosphere.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of late collect children from school when you are away from their place of work.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this will generate in a natural way a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
Thus, Arch.Design is situated between the companies sign that they offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: supporting the family and, ultimately, this programme strengthened the marketing staff.
The House of bones still fascinates after 100 years. Observe the interiors of Gaudí
The roof seems to the back of a prehistoric lizard, staircases resemble the spine of a dinosaur and balconies seem to open mouth of a fish.
This is the Casa Batlló in Barcelona, the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Due to its similar to a skeleton, locals nicknamed the "the House of bones."
Their organic shapes, bright colours, the innovative use of the stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade that reminds the scales and the omnipresent gently curved lines, this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the House play with dreamy lines, delicate colours and textures taken from nature and wildlife.
Paying more attention, it notes a certain geometry, rhythm and a thoughtful order.
At night, across the front of the House looks even more impressive, given that it is lit in such a way to improve the brightness of the colors.
It meanders and the torsion of the ways we continues to surprise also inside.
The wavy wood copy Windows frameworks, the railings, the ornaments of the doors, the peepholes and signs.
The Casa Batlló, which is located in the Eixample district in issue 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig of Grácia, emerged from the renovation of a House of the year 1877 of the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the House was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted in breaking down the previous building and start from scratch, but soon accepted the idea of Gaudí for a novel and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló, consisting of various apartments, did not design the Antoni Gaudí only.
Collaborated in the design architect Josep Maria Jujol.
In fact, in their plans for the project arose decorations for the apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the facade.
The facade also worker other creators and artists.
Collaboration in the proposals of the Batlló House was the home of the successful collaboration of Jujol with Antoni Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Milá and the Park Güell of Gaudí, in which there are other pieces of the same.
Locals was due to its organic form, shortly after its completion the nicknamed "the House of bones."
Others, because of the mechanism specific opening of Windows began to call it "the House of yawning."
Also States which, at the top of the building, is the sword of Saint George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of construction hide religious grounds.
Gaudí projected in the House a single system for the era of central heating with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Its inclination of forty-five degrees can be strange.
During construction, Gaudí not respected at all the rules for the construction of the time and didn't were influenced by them.
Still, construction obtained permission from the beginning, although obviously in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, to its completion, the Hall was so impressed with the result that requested it be corrected.
It bothered, for example, that the construction included columns even until the public sidewalk.
Arrangements never realized, but on the contrary: only fifteen days after the request of the City Council, Josep Batlló requested (and received) permission to rent the two top floors of the building.
The own owner was installed in the lower floors.
The Gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the part private of the apartment.
The ground floor is leased to a jewelry shop.
The six-story house is completely crossed by a staircase that leads to the terrace of the roof.
The basic elements of the reform consisted in breaking all the angles and straight lines, covering of curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connection of space.
The common part can be connected completely opening the doors of the rooms and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without that it renounce the necessary privacy for more intimate discussions.
The House, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only received a new façade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is impressive also how play Gaudí with the light, white and blue tiles that cover the inner courtyard and skylights.
The game with two colors provides maximum light on every floor of the House.
It was based simply on the principle that the white reflects more light than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb the Sun's rays.
Anyone can visit the Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the list of world heritage of humanity by Unesco.
On the first floor of the House is the apartment more spacious and more ornate of the accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150 th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With visits confirmed, or discovered, that is a very profitable business and extended visits to the common area and the attic, including the terrace of the roof.
The price of the entrance to the monument is not insignificant, reaches 16,50 euros, although students, retirees and the tourist card holders get a 20% discount.
The amount exceeds considerably the price of the entry of other buildings by Gaudí in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed with its towers of lizard, it should make friend quickly of any resident of the neighbouring houses and visit him at home.
How choose the mattress and the bed frame: women and men looking for different things
Nothing of a pompous framework for bed; What really gives his quality at a good bed is the surface to lie down, i.e. the mattress and the bed frame.
First and foremost must complement perfectly to adapt to specific users.
During the election come into play many elements, including weight, height, health status and sex of the owner.
The type of interior which is situated the mattress and the bed frame is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in a cottage weekend which does not usually have heating, not be used latex mattresses because "heated" more slowly.
In addition, they often weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them back more often.
If she is not duly bemoaning the channels of the Centre and, above, they are on a firm basis, remain inside the humidity. Mold below may even appear.
When choosing a bed, also influence customs.
Who has spent much time abroad, often used a very high mattress with a soft layer and it will fail to feel good in a low, hard surface.
"Almost all hockey players that returned the NHL complained that he not here slept just as well."
"For his crushed shoulders, hips and heels needed with a soft layer of viscoelastic mattresses."
"This type of mattress is recommended also for people with diabetes to time problems of the nervous system, so receive wrong information of joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, which specializes in furniture upholstery.
Many players in hockey, as well as other customers, have long preferring viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these appropriate Tempur and Magniflex Italians, but also the brand Czech Tropico."
Already there to be an NHL player to appreciate the viscoelastic.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimize its rigidity and forms in function of the absorbed heat or adapts to your body heat.
No pressure; during the night, it will not give laps after a hard match.
Simply sleeping better.
The viscoelastic also serves as protection against the sores.
Choose the size of the mattress, add to match the length of your feet, i.e. between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of individual rooms, e.g. singles, recommended a minimum between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, a simple rule can be applied to calculate the width: to lie down face up, should have their hands comfortably up to the elbows," advised the engineer Helena Prokopová, expert of Cechu čalouníků to dekoratérů, which already has for many years to address the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of the furniture, item that taught in specialized schools.
In the double rooms, each need their own bed frame and mattress, so during purchase you have to pay attention to combining the height of mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the bases at different altitudes, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with docks within a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeter are for the layer that fits the forms and softens.
"To play it with the hand or to settle in the mattress, certainly not should note the docks," Helena Prokopová warns.
Each mattress requires a type of particular bedspring.
Fully padded dormitories, where the mattress and the base are like Siamese twins, are meaningless in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe wrong and you may not be washed his Holster, which today is often.
And, given that every night transpiramos between 0.2 and 0.75 l from sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a great (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, scholars reject the slogans that speak of a life of the mattress of up to 25 years or, even, a guarantee of lifetime.
However, everything has a but.
So, sellers give a Council: in the mattress with a width of 120 or 140 cm, deal with carefully cleaning and washing of the cover, but better add a protector of mattress that can remove and wash easily.
Although mattress with zipper closure liners are currently manufactured at around its perimeter, so to open them are in two parts (very important for washing and the size of a washing machine!), handling in models of larger (and by a single person) by lifting the mattress may look like a fight between a weight fly and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a bed frame, do you have a firm table?
Never!
As much for bedding designed so that they become overnight visits.
However, do (if you have not already) holes of ventilation in the table and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the docks in bags (such as the Taschenfederkern German) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For the mattress not articulables plates and containing between 14 and 18 blades, can use latex mattresses or mattress sandwich (for example, a combination of latex and coconut fibre), although a bedspring with a greater number of sheets is always better28 or more, in which the sheets of the lower back are reinforced and its rigidity can be regulated.
The bases of articulables sheets should not be used with a mattress of spring, since it does not react to the recline.
In addition to the adjustment of the rigidity of the sheets, the protection of shoulders can also be used.
It's a special fixation of the sheets that allows pressure or even tilt the plates in such a way that "they often" perfectly shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, it's something very important.
They even remember the manufacturers of mattresses in the "male," began to use a softer zone precisely around the shoulders.
Also remember the women, for which put a softer zone around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are beds with structure in cross or tablets with the so-called buffer multitorsión.
The pressure is distributed between different points and it lowers the tension.
You must have in mind also that, although using proper mattress and bed frame, if it uses a bad pillow (large and "soft"), will disappear most of the gains.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must support the head and corners can only be up to shoulders, so you can relax the muscles in the same.
The recommended size is 50 x 60 cm, normal for example in Scandinavia.
To lie down side, the pillow must be at the same level (when it is combined with the bedspring with reinforcement for shoulder or softer mattress area) than the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to do, it seems, with the original mattresses stuffed with straw.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or, at least mixtures.
In fact, they are fashionable biological mattresses.
Raw materials based on oil, which is made from polyurethane foam, are filled with natural oils, for example Castor or soy.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers employ soy.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the Center is only made of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček company Tropico Plus.
Also, use natural substances for the manufacture of the cover of the mattress, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for the microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma of forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men are "refreshed" with extracts plant of Breeze, so that the mattress cover absorbs the heat and refresh the body, women prefer to "warm up" the case.
Red pepper extract improves the blood circulation, so that the women feel more warmth.
The Favorites now?
Mattresses manufactured cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which means that they are more permeable than normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various rigidities of cold foam and viscoelastic allow to manufacture mattresses of various areas who know perfectly well where is the head, shoulders and heels.
A mattress of good quality will cost seven thousand kroner up.
Those which have a therapeutic role typically have a lower VAT, insofar as medical.
Gumotex was the first who obtained this advantage in the Czech Republic.
It is difficult to save in mattresses and mattress.
Sometimes the deals from manufacturers or vendors, which sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one may pass.
For example, the brand Magniflex offers Duofreeze mattresses with a foam with memory Memory attached to the cover by 11.990 crowns.
The second is done free of charge.
The era of the viscoelastic with an open cell structure and a high density began with "cosmic" Tempur material.
Initially emerged as a material for NASA, because during take-offs loas astronauts were subjected to an enormous overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the body human, warm, a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
It is therefore ideal to prevent sores, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Foam viscoelastic not only is used in mattresses, but also for medical devices, e.g. for pillows which are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as its circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use the Eucatherm C foam or Twinsaver and similar.
Increasingly more parents employ people tracking devices to monitor their children
Fear for the children is increasingly more people thinking about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also follow the movement of people and contribute as well, for example, in case such as the disappearance of the girl child of nine years Anička Janatková.
By the time the device is the approximate size of a box of matches, but will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
A lot of people gave him fear the case of the missing Anička and began to report on the resources available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
"All are trying to tell us that it is not spying, but other means to decrease the chances of that there will be a tragedy," considers Petr Pilin company Macro Weil, one of the providers of monitoring in the Czech market devices.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, it can abuse such devices, for example if they get into the bag of someone without their knowledge, but still we have not encountered such cases."
"Most of the customers really buy for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In her opinion, children should always know what does the "box" and how it is used in an emergency.
Dana Bočková child psychologist warns about the fact that, if the child does not want to take it, simply pull you.
"Even the youngest children show great creativity when it comes to losing intentionally certain things if they want to prevent from controlling them it."
"Soon, parents relied greatly on mobile phones, but they could turn off as easily as monitoring device," says Bočková.
In his view, it is questionable whether such a device is really useful in case of attack.
"If it's a prepared kidnapping, the author almost always check if the child takes some kind of electronic device that can reveal its location."
"Now is the phone."
"Find enemies as it goes spreading the use of tracking devices, also for, since that sale will undoubtedly be made with much publicity."
"In such cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of police," says the psychologist.
It adds, however, that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack of a pedophile.
According to Robert Compactification of the RC Monitoring company, offering services of follow-up both for vehicles and people, even in case that after an attack, immediately destroying the follow-up mechanism, its presence can help.
"You can configure the device regularly send the position after a certain period."
"If it suffers damage, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person in question."
"The more expensive devices have integrated a tilt meter, so if you simply slips and falls, the device issue immediately a warning with the position in question," says Čech.
In his view, this kind of service can be obtained even with smart mobile phones with navigation, that only a special software must be installed.
The problem of the current monitoring units is that for the moment it's devices with a size similar to a box of matches or the mobile phones of smaller size.
Therefore, they may be lost.
According to Pilin Macro Weil, for that reason are being evidence now with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage is that a possible aggressor may not identify the device."
"Or that identified it after some time, which can be done to the police to win time," he added.
Although tracking devices are at the wrist or hanging, they continue to use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
It is the checking of the position with a GPS system (used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that connects the current position.
The army has sufficient Wicks to surround all Czech Republic. But only last two years
The Czech Army bought 445 km from wick to ignite explosives.
Now the Ministry of defence last year added to his arsenal 224 kilometers from mecha.
Therefore, they have stock for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the fuse is of two years, four at most.
The Army purchased the fuse for explosives to STV Group, a. s. forty million kroner.
The General staff replied to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such enormous mecha saying that soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometers from mecha per year.
According to the calculations of the pyrotechnics of the army, which was in contact MF DNES, decided however that, in such a case, should take these maneuvers with frequent use of explosives every year also all the generals, officers in high command, and even Secretaries and cleaners.
Neither the Defense Minister Alexandr Vondr and the captain of the army Vlastimil Picek wanted not exempt.
Only thus is could be justified that the army spent sixty kilometers from mecha.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if, the army would have enough for more than a decade inventories.
If on the contrary, such as say the experts, for the initial training of each new Professional comes with a maximum of two metres of mecha, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding consumption of units of engineers or special) sufficient for the 225 above stocks.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained personally recently before the Minister Vondra because say that they have little ammunition for various guns, so are limited even the practices of tyre as a matter of money.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I neither achievement understand that they buy us repeatedly such amounts of mecha."
"But it's his decision and they will know without a doubt, why do so."
"For us, the army is a good customer who, as a company, we try to meet," admits the commercial director of STV Group, Jan Děcký.
The spokesman of the Ministry of defence Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometers of mecha also saying that it will have stocks of this "ammunition" at least for ten years.
Jan Děcký, STV Group, however, indicates that the only mecha has a lifespan of four years and in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, in two years.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, can last up to four," said one of the soldiers who, for the possible criticism of the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its useful life, each ammunition should check carefully to see if it is still reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require an additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, to buy 445 kilometres of mecha, it got a discount.
"We cost 60% less than the order of the last year of 244 km," indicates the Pejšek spokesman of the Ministry of defence shopping center.
Just to compare: annual consumption of mecha of the pyrotechnics in the police, which remove the ammunition from World War II or the left by the Soviet army, does not exceed already for years the 1,500 meters.
In addition, police always seeks only the right amount to exhaust the ammunition before the end of its useful life.
So they decided for security reasons for the pyrotechnic and, moreover, meanwhile you can get more modern and reliable types of mecha.
The Ministry already has clear difficulty finishing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition at the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics that MF DNES, spoke after a couple of years will be the next problem with the current: will have to eliminate hundreds of kilometres of old Wick, which is buying now "cheap."
Until now I still live contacts that I got through the contest
The fact of winning the "Entrepreneur of the year" contest helped Lukáš Pytloun in the sale of its hotel franchises.
The last edition, won the competition "Entrepreneur of the year" the entrepreneur 28-year-old Lukáš Pytloun in Liberec.
Your success story seems taken from a film.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad he realized that in Liberec was needed quality accommodation at reasonable prices.
With the savings that met with seasonal work abroad and a credit from the Bank bought a House that was half another thrown down it consists of five floors.
Taking into account that he was still studying his third year at the University, it was really brave.
"Currently, the relationship quality-price of the accommodation in our area I pushed to do something about," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He began to rent the first rebuilt to foreign workers.
All income from the invested back into the building, which gradually became a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, seven years in the business, it did not quite soon opening in Liberec four pensions, two restaurants in style and two hotels with a capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and others are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise," said businessman number one of the last year.
"This sale of licenses for the opening of hotels helped very much the fact of winning the contest of the 'Entrepreneur of the year'," adds grateful Pytloun.
The victory increased his fame and popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People I recognized on the street, still I congratulated often, and I must say, that it was very nice," he recalls.
You would certainly recommend to everybody who wants to try to any company that participates in the competition.
But it considers that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is beneficial.
He says that, so far, it still lives of contacts and acquaintances who, without the contest, perhaps had not obtained.
"With some people I met with the cooperation I have started to collaborate regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
in total around seventy.
"I have seen that show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something which obtained general recognition."
"It is not, much less my own personal success, but that is the result of the hard work of the team."
"Just what is my name which appears on the front page," says today modestly Lukáš Pytloun.
To my successor, I wish a quieter year from which we have had in Farmet
The euphoria of victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has passed the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žďárský, received the first prize in the latest edition of the Vodafone "Company of the year" contest, the last year in the "Slavonic House" of Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, which managed to convert a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice in a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me to me, but all my colleagues and improved our confidence to fight the competition," said the winner of last year.
The company Farmet's history begins with the desire to do something useful.
For this reason, when the State proposed to the father of Karel Žďárský the rent of a small workshop like compensation for the seizure of property during communism, no doubt too; He resigned from his position in the company that worked, and with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father to stacks of plastic.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in the center of Europe.
They also obtained a greater presence among the non-specialized audience having reached success in the competition in the media.
"Not only our customers began to consider the brand Farmet as significantly better, but that also foreign partners began to value the partnership with a company that achieved greater success in their country," said Karel Žďárský.
Perhaps last year was not only Farmet a sample of the euphoria of victory.
He also was recognized by the commercial results until 2008 and, partially, 2009.
And just the year 2009 was the toughest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused businesses halt their investment projects and began to limit the purchase of new machinery or technology.
"We obviously nor us rid of such a situation."
"Earnings were reduced by 40%, we had to limit the production, and we even had some redundancies," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company should, sometimes, take even unpopular measures.
They controlled the situation, however, and kept the profits of the company, although at lower levels that before the crisis.
However, where Farmet not cut expenditure was in the research and development.
"Subsidies we have built a Centre for research and training, reinforce the presence in the international market and we got great ratings in national fairs," says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Income again increased and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement expected to provide a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," said Karel Žďárský.
A survey that reveals the ridiculous rules
Survey of the year Absurdez part for the fourth time in the corporate tournament.
It has already succeeded in eliminating some ridiculous rules.
The winner of the new edition of the survey year Absurdez unknown was the obligation to carry the administration documents which staff members can access online.
The decision adopted it more than a third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the social security administration requested an extract from the commercial register, although its officials can get it with two movements of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech social security administration already not asked an extract from the commercial register when you make a control from the impositions of the insured," said ČSSZ spokeswoman Jana Buraňová.
The objective of the survey year Absurdez is to consult the rules and regulations that must be respected companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and try that would eliminate those that are absurd.
This year is by fourth once part of the business publication Hospodářské tournament noviny and begins to create hobby also among the general public.
While last year's Edition counted with the participation of three thousand voters this year reached nearly four thousand.
And it is not surprising, given that we still have legal obligations several very well that should be respected just to Transact.
"Maybe in number of paperwork for filing are first world," says Karel Havlíček from the Association of small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business rules is a stated objective of all Governments.
However, in comparison with the rest of the world, the status of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, Czech Republic is situated in the 74th position, that is, eight worse than last year.
The Absurdez of the year contest was held for the first time in 2006 and each year is repeated in the same way.
Anyone can indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdez each year between April and late September, when the contest is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the contest chooses seven candidates for the "antipremio" and, during October, allows the public to vote online through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdez that receives most votes WINS.
For this year's survey were presented more than one hundred, including 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
The examples sent both employers and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that the vehicle for the maintenance of the roads and highways to pay the toll or that employers with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint every two years the walls.
The list of the seventy proposals for this year is published in the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the contest, which always occurs at the beginning of November in Prague Wenceslas Square, part of an event in which are often involved political and social personalities.
This year, for example, attended this ceremony of the contest Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be sustained if the State continuously puts obstacles to employers, so my aim in on eliminating each year a minimum of thirty paras that currently unnecessarily complicate trade," announced the Minister of industry and trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate the absurd regulations are not left in water of Borage.
In 2007, that most bothered people was the duty of the employer to communicate with three days in advance to the corporate office in the area of permanent operation, intended to attend a trade fair or exhibition with a stand.
This obligation was removed in the new industrial law.
The obligation that finished second in number of votes in 2007, i.e., the communication to the Office of work by foreign employees of the travel of up to 30 working days, was removed in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third is the expired.
The Absurdez of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists have a large mirror, a fridge and two scales of soil in your query.
For this reason, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a fridge.

Police made arrests during a public auction in the building of the agricultural fund, in Pilsen
Anti-corruption police made several arrests in the building of the agricultural fund in the last few days.
The detectives to a local businessman of the media sector and the real estate businessman handcuffed Luboš G.
Apparently this attempt to manipulate public auction under way for the restitution of rights in such a way the auctioned land receive it a be interested.
It should pay him for it Luboš g. half a million crowns.
"For the only time can tell that the police looking for a person by bribery during a public auction and public tender," the head of the Attorney general of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that for the moment you can not disclose more details about the ongoing investigation told Právo.
After twenty-four hours, the police dropped the employer of 46 years.
On the way in which could influence the auction public, given the little official information, only can speculate.
The spokesman of the Fund agricultural Lubomíra Černá responded to the questions of Právo saying that the police took place really the arrest at the headquarters of Pilsen and during a public auction.
"This is a client, not of one of our workers," he said.
According to Černá, the auction is called "Call for the submission of proposals for transfers of land in accordance" with the law on Earth and is performed when various parties concerned in relation to the offered field.
"These people, during the call, offer superior value to its restitution, which must be transferred before the announcement of the value of the land."
"Based on bids, determines the order of the buyers and, later, the agricultural fund transfer field to the person who offered the highest bid" said the spokesman of the Fund.
Luboš g. had information about who was going to submit to the call and, at the same time being interested person because he acquired several rights of restitution, proposed to stakeholders on the ground that he would not participate in the auction.
So please, it was charging a Commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, had so much money on top.
Luboš g. Special in the Pilsen Fund contacts already had it for a long time.
Contained in the case of the former head of the PF Václav Sankot, he was accused by dispatch the replacement of land for which had already issued a decision of construction.
For example, Luboš g. just get fund land for the construction of public infrastructure, particularly in the place where you should build a great road to the industrial area of Borská pole.
Very beneficial way to judge later, changed them by a house in the historical centre of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the City Council had to intervene because, otherwise, blocked land would avoid the construction.
Families must pay an additional expenditure of several hundred crowns a month
Households will pay not only January for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, accessories for heating and, in some cases, higher rents.
Therefore, families will have to take portfolio, as of January, several hundred kroner per month more than now.
The price of electricity increased by 4.6%, the gas around 2%, in some cities should pay up to 10% more for the supply of water and many also increase the price of the central heating.
The rise of electricity for households living in apartments should amount to some 100 Crowns over a year now.
However, the main suppliers of electricity reduced prices, because it has increased support for the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular the photovoltaic.
However, the gas becomes more expensive moderately, especially in the time that more heating is used and, therefore, greater consumption.
In this case, also they must have a couple of hundreds of Crowns more year.
While electricity and gas is expensive throughout the country, the change in price of central heating varies from place to another.
The rise in prices the plan mainly the largest municipality.
For example, Pardubice and Hradec Králové households pay since January for central heating a 50 kroner more a month, whilst Liberec families paying more than 1,000 additional crowns a year.
Prague residents must also support an increase of 9% of the price of water and heating, especially where the city increase the rental of infrastructures.
If the rent does not vary, the praguenses will be paid an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, remain among the lowest in the country.
In Northern Bohemia, where the current prices are among the highest, both rates encarecerán 7.4%.
They can significantly increase the prices of the rental of 450,000 flats rented in Prague, where the regulation will expire in January.
For example, the company ICC Byty, possessing in Ústí nad Labem around 2,500 flats, will increase the rent from January up to 100%.
The company will take to the courts to those who may not agree with the new rental.
Regulated rents, which benefit the residents of about 300,000 story, could increase up to 10% next year.
The young Czechs losses with Fernet and ron. The beer is no longer so, because it takes effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskey stolen from their parents.
These are beverages that cause that young drinkers with an age less than 15 years will end up in medical care.
Children who have just lying in the hospital constantly to overcome the hangover as they are not an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors found with such cases in the Pediatrics hospital admissions.
"Drink beer or wine already is not fashionable, because they are slow to get drunk them."
"Now the fashion are the strong alcoholic drinks," tells Právo Chief of Pediatrics of the Hořovice Hospital in the Centre of Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán.
"When they do take a bottle to his father in the cupboard, it may be whisky, but normally is Fernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage that is lightened with juice and that no smell so much," he explains.
Also confirms it the spokesman for the Hospital universitario Motol, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it is usually of Fernet Branca or ron."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, use brandy got at home," adds Jurinová.
According to the Chief Pelikán, they are drinkers of thirteen and fourteen years tend to appear in the hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where he worked from this year, he worked for a decade in paediatrics in Motol, where ambulances carrying young people from nearby areas.
"A girl was perhaps admitted four times."
"Began at the age of twelve, when they brought with 3.5 of alcohol in blood, as well as a mixture of ecstasy," indicates the physician of the Department on this case.
"He was in the fair of Holešovice in a dancing party."
"What is interesting is that her mother nor surprised him that his daughter disappearance 48 hours," the Chief is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of the parents or even their clear tolerance towards the drink by his sons which is considered the main cause of the increase in the consumption of alcohol among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, not can speak proper dependency.
"Means alcoholic to a person who has a chronic alcohol dependence for several years, with all phenomena associated with the card, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, rather is a family or social environment systematically failed," explains the head Pelikán.
According to the spokesman Jurinová, this year in the Pediatric Clinic of Motol is was hospitalized until the middle of November forty drunk children.
However, statistics show only those that come with serious poisoning and must stay in the hospital.
Young drinkers, after traveling medical examination, they go home with their parents or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases in which children simply meet after school and you drink liquor, there are three seasonal downs to be mentioned for Pelikán: Bruges, new year's day and the end of the school year.
"In such circumstances, they drink by the poor grades or, instead, celebrate the start of the holiday."
"On the day of the witches have come to see in admissions to seven drunken children at the same time," he adds Pelikán.
The drinkers that they spend the night in detoxification under medical supervision, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
The morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided with the injection of a serum with glucose and the nutrients that it lacks the body.
"They take him much better, because after the hectic night, they stood up well and it doesn't hurt anything."
"Only show confused connection where are," says Pelikán, adding that, often, patients lose the good mood at least when they see the costs generated by.
The transfer by ambulance and hospital stay in a room for serious patients reaches cost ten of thousands of Crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when in the visit directly say them to the children how much it has cost his drunkenness and that it would take all summer in a job for young people so that you win enough to pay for that night," adds Pelikán.
Health insurance, in its opinion may as a regressive measure, which tends to return to the people of the treatment costs, does not in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in outside hands on Spain
Two L-159 aircraft from a total of five, by which the Czech Defence Ministry replaced the aircraft Casa C - 295 M, left on Tuesday for Seville, where the Casa - EADS aircraft manufacturer.
This is the first time that a device of this type is in the hands of someone other than the Czech Army.
For the time being, only they were abroad for practice or demonstration flights.
It is the two-seat version L-159T1, which until now used the Czech Army and who was still in a State of fly.
The three remaining aircraft are the single-seat L-159.
They are still preserved in Aer Vodochody and the intermediary from the sale, the company Omnipol, already took over them last week.
Jan Peješk, of the Department of Defense press, indicates that it is not yet known when the aircraft is withdraw physically of Vodochody.
"The aircraft single-seat L-159, on the other hand, were separated from repaired aircraft for a time, no investment or additional contributions by the Ministry."
"The two-seat L-159T1 were exchanged in its current state," told Právo Pejšek.
He added that the army is not running out two-seat aircraft, given that in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody amounting to 200 million kroner for the construction of four L-159 devices unnecessary for two-seaters.
One of the new aircraft already received the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS is committed to that aircraft will be added to the equipment of some Allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that the EADS Company is that removed the L-159 aircraft and that they will serve to the practices of pilots of NATO countries."
Therefore, the buyer decide how to use them in this framework, depends notes Pejšek.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published ahead of time, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
Five L-159 aircraft home Exchange and the purchase of three aircraft by 3,500 million kroner were approved last year by the Government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of defence did not call a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current direction of Defense says that the Exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army acquired Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
Jets home will possibly come to legal consequences.
The European Commission already reported to the Ministry of defence Czech before the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft carrying out a European tender and not contacting with a single manufacturer.
The army already received three House and the latter should arrive at the Airport Prague's Kbely in fourteen days.
A longer than the annular finger indicates a lower risk of developing cancer
Men who have longer than the ring index are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a studied published on Wednesday in a British Journal of cancer.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results suggest that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, in particular for men with ages of up to 60 years," said the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, Professor of the Institute for research on cancer in the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a test for prostate cancer, particularly if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other adverse factors such as family health problems, according to Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, followed with a British counterpart more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, at the same time, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index finger of right hand more short than the ring.
They were as likely to suffer from prostate cancer that 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
Among men with a longer index finger cancel, this risk was reduced by 33 per cent; for men aged less than 60 per cent reduction amounted to 87%.
The relationship between the length of two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period reflects different levels of hormones that the fetus in the womb is exposed.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies showed that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great geneticist Czech and former President of the Academy of Sciences, the Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that knows the study, but do not you think that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer is to "prove completely."
The Czech Republic under snow: the D1 and the D5 are closed

The American soldiers have a new "smart gun"
The U.S. Army is using a new "smart" weapon, known at the moment only for the encoded name XM-25 in Afghanistan.
The General hope that the new rifle will have influence in the local conflict with the Taliban and that "change the game's progress" it was their victory.
The new weapons are as a small pistol and with an extremely precise aim.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
Created special calibre of 25 mm ammunition for this rifle and the high burden of explosives that contains results that really functions like a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed so that they exploit not only when they hit the target, but at any point in its ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against the enemies who hide behind a barrier, a wall or a trench.
Without a doubt, you cannot use a normal protection and, when it launches its murderous rain of metallic chips, it may be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke on the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for infantry that uses a "smart" technology.
"The soldiers the manipulated in such a way that they are objective, they point to the same its beam laser, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of sight and, according to it, corrects line of projection and squeezes the trigger."
"We say that they have been measured 543 metres."
"When it is pressed the trigger, the gun is loaded and launches the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, more less one, two or three meters," said Audette.
Move 400 jobs
The Fujitsu Consortium moved its branch office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July the following year, 400 employees will change their place of work of its previous Office building in the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moved its branch office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported the giant specializing in computer industry and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July next year of their previous Office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large complex of offices on the Lyoner Straße Street in the District of Niederrad, in Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesman explained that in the medium term other 100 employees of the Consortium, which were previously scattered through the region, will stay there.
The offer is highly attractive, also collective Astro Park Office will promote the way of work of employees.
Addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner stated, "Franfkurt-Niederrad we found in a central location with an excellent infrastructure."
The bright connection to the airport is now very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday caused joy among those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against.
The Chief of section of economy of Frankfurt, Frank Markus (CDU) stated that a "Global Player" has earned this.
This is a "magnificent site recognition."
Fujitsu is based in the city, the settlement is a great boost for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (the Greens) deplores the decision of Fujitsu.
The management before informed the city on his intention.
"Naturally have offered the company our assistance," Korwisi said.
However, good contacts with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz manufacturer of computers have not been able to change in difficulties.
At the end and after, the economic reasons they produced the fall.
So, there is now a great empty place that cover in the famous post.
"I hope the owner and the renter of the building to show cooperative."
The building previously used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "kleine vertikale" part with the remaining buildings in Marienbader Platz from ten years of a controversial project of construction of the City Spa.
A new entry to the city, which is in charge of the criticism regarding the massive building that previously used the gaps as parking spaces and the level of the buildings is formed as a joint project of the city and a private projects between the station and the Town Hall.
In 2001 have settled the Ministry of investment and business valuation, the manufacturer of Software for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then joined Siemens with the home computers Fujitsu manufacturer.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the real estate group in Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-State-Gruppe with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid Spanish.
Fujitsu, a native of Tokyo, the Consortium is recognized as the third largest global provider of it.
There are companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides the precise services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name of TDS.
For this reason have hired 7,000 square meters in the Astro Park Office building.
The old complex of the 1920s, its name alludes to its plane with star-shaped, houses among others the central Association of electrotechnical and electronic industry.
Amazon cancels the server - threats against Assange
Anxiety takes over more and more of Wikileaks.
Amazon internet service provider has eliminated the revelations of its server platform.
Possibly behind is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, founder of Wikileaks, is apparently being held in England.
The revelations of Wikileaks platform is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and now seek a homeland of the internet in Europe.
The well-known American Senator, Joe Lieberman, called on other countries and companies to boycott of Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, found in the list of wanted persons of Interpol, must remain arrested in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled Server Amazon."
"Speaking freely in the country of freedom," reported the activists of the revelations by the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet, Amazon, company had eliminated Wikileaks from their server documents.
Internet activists had resorted in the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the website of Amazon services to address the high numbers of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: "perfect, devote our dollars to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of your server by Wikileaks, once an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman have been applied research, it was reported the network CNN in a call to the Office of Lieberman.
The Presidency of the Council of the Senate for the security of the country had threatened to Amazon to boycott, reported the British "guardian."
"Had wanted Amazon to take these measures soon, before the previous publications of information classified by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also in other countries banned the use of the server.
"The monstrous and inconsiderate illegal process of Wikileaks brings into play our national security and threatens the life in the world," he said in a statement from the independent Senator.
"Any responsible company, either American or foreign, should help to Wikileaks with its service to extend stolen material."
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is in the list of wanted persons of Interpol.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent," the 39-year-old Australian is arrested in Great Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
Internet activist has been constantly described research in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, spokeswoman said in London that there have been threats.
"There was even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That is why it fears for the safety of Assange said Hrafnsson.
It therefore still not reveal the location of the founder of Wikileaks.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to the statements of North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, said the head of the revelations of Wikileaks should be tried for treason and must be run.
In Canada, said an adviser to the head of the Stephen Harper Government, clearly with irony, on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could be "used a drone."
Between the White House and Assange grows a great dispute.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman for the American President Barack Obama, described as "ridiculous and absurd" Assange has requested the resignation of Secretary of State, where she is responsible for order recently to diplomats that they involucrasen in spied.
"Am not quite sure why we should import the view of a guy with a webpage," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than your web page."
The American Government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of their databases in general.
Russell Travers, Deputy director of distribution of the National Center on terrorism, was named outstanding maintainer, announced the White House.
By what Travers is responsible for developing "important structural reforms," as may be necessary in the light of the filtration of Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to inspect roads, as well as change the total information on the Government and protect her.
In addition, the U.S. Government announced that to deal with the security of the dissidents and activists, should be put at risk publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything possible to get in touch with them," said the spokesman for the Department of State, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to help protect them if necessary."
The University's ice cream
"Gelato University" in Bologna are preparing ice in the best times of the year.
The basic course of three days for future ice has the peak and visitors from around the world.
In reality where comes the ice cream?
The gelatiere and the gelataio.
The gelatiere produces the cream according to all rules of the Italian art of the development of ice cream.
The gelataio brings the cream of the ice cream counter with a spatula, extends it on the wafer and sells it.
To know this, do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream, should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped Gelato University with freezer in 2003, the cream of ice cream of your machines to fulfill the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course of three days for future ice has the peak and visitors from around the world.
There are also more special courses more days on the chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream parlor of the home.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk their vague desires in the soft ice cream.
This time they are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, teacher of this art in California, love the slow food movement and in the future wants to offer a European quality product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, of Berlin, is Advisor to companies and wants to create something himself in some years in an unnerving work.
Two Egyptian youth dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man of Malta and other Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream bars, and a housewife Canadian, Julia, comes because their children love the Italian ice cream.
Heladero maestro Luciano Ferrari explained to participants later the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Only its good taste, but also its silky softness and good consistency is not decisive.
Lucian does not forget its formation or the cover of cream in the upper house national and mainly in the South of the country: "the Italian gelato is quite simply the best, and therefore each ball has something romantic."
The first step to developing seems easy.
Luciano takes the basic ingredients: milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large Blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and when cools down it up to four degrees.
Then open the tap of the machine and get a pasteurised white basic cream, the basis for all types of ice cream from milk.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: cream ice cream can be made only with natural elements or without estabalizador?
How can we give rein to some desire to experience?
Luciano advised that they despisten the trends of the time.
Which speaks of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients," perhaps has likely used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, gum guar, of guar beans.
Of course that you can make ice cream without stabilizer, just have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and customer morderá a sound granite ice cream.
Allowed certain variations in the basic mass.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, the maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients which are bought in the section of fruit or sweets from the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastes.
"All providers try to sneak ingredients scented in its merchandise."
"However they must experience ever."
Whether with straws of fruit with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the cream of ice cream of white basic mass, with eggs will be a yellow cream and cocoa powder as a basis for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now the course participants can use the heladoras.
Luciano leaves them increasingly elaborate four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mocha and avellana, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
They also make the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream.
Who knows better not dependent necessarily have more scent of tofe or more fruit puree.
It is not necessary that the hazelnut ice cream know nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The Working Group produced the beloved ice cream of kiwi, which uses more fruit, less water and less than stabilizer.
First a balanced mix highlights the flavor of ice cream, says Luciano.
The development of ice cream is a problem of artimética: mashed Peach with much sugar is used, we must reduce the proportion of sugar of the basic recipe.
Lemon ice cream requires an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes a tool that sets the amount of sugar in the types of fruit (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately the tables facilitate the account.
Does not require more than the physical application, as before to make ice cream.
It not only helps the appliance to the automatic processing of the basic mass.
There is also a utensil, which beat at the same time the mix of ice cream prepared and cooled at a temperature below zero.
Nevertheless, all automation remains outside in the small pasta.
The Brazilian Gustavo stain himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if it were a giant miniprimer without control.
"In all courses," says maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time that something happens as well."
Inspectors in a difficult situation
The Efsa food safety authority has infiltrated into the industry that experiments with transgenic plants.
Currently this subject formulates Testbiotech experts group, which is considered an Institute for the independent evaluation of the impact of biotechnology.
"Find a conspiracy theory but we have not documented well," said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, director of the Group of experts of Efsa on genetically modified plants, and other expert, Efsa also are employed for years in the Ilsi Association.
Corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle and Bayer costean.
Kuiper has worked significantly on the auditing standards of Efsa of genetically modified plants, which places him in a clear conflict of interest, Then criticizes.
Efsa provisions are paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and mimic the writing of the company, which is in reality controlled by the Italian authorities in Parma.
It is the second time that Testbiotech criticizes a collision of interests.
So, recently, a manager of high rank of Efsa was without the support or the time of transition to the Agrarkonzern Switzerland, Syngenta, and it has changed with that his side.
Recently, also Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and industry, who carried out the official General of environment as well as a clairvoyant parliamentary of the EU.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
The details of formal, also to some of the industry, are used provided that they are of a high technical quality, she is ordered in a report.
You are not required to the experts working in Efsa that they do not have any contact with the industry.
But they should expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.UU.
Referred to himself as a neutral forum for experts and the science, industry and politics, among others to the risk assessment for biotechnology without the job of Lobby.
In this topic, independent experts, as Then, criticize that currently allow transgenic plants without investigating the food for the animals and that do not check the influence of plants genetically modified in the environment.
"We want to know what, for example, the genetically modified maize on agriculture," he said Then.
Current practice is to check only isolated proteins, but not the transgenic plant learns, which does not provide reliable results.
"If they do not seek the risks, how are going to find?," asked, accuser, Then.
Angelina Byrnes thinks the same way.
Scientist investigates the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working on the Technical Institute in Zurich.
In this area, the industry tries to more and more, in the United States.UU. and in Europe, influencing or discredit the critical scientists.
For this reason, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For enterprises, critical studies are not published as a general rule.
"The industry control research of safety," maintains Byrnes.
The trail of the stones
ULI Gsell has achieved some, in total about 400 kg.
On Monday it was Stuttgart station, with the Tuba at the back.
There were demonstrations
It snowed.
The story is known: in September bulldozers and began to break down a large piece of the North Wing.
The land of Stuttgart never again to be the same: thousands demonstrated against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, the vast majority of the wing was made rubble.
Broken into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell was sculptor in Ostfildern, is 43 years old.
It has ensured a couple of pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"Not must disappear."
Be excited: "A stone cheap and poor, simple and natural."
As he once said, it has olido smoke cigarettes.
Still do not know what will do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
ULI Gsell also.
The trail of the stones of Stuttgart leads to a forest in Tubingen where Manuel Rongen raised his stone Stein-Reich in previous dump of ammunition of the French Navy.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
It has purchased everything what a result of the demolition in Stuttgart.
"Would disgrace, they molerían the gravel or send her to the dustbin," he says in his Office, a little wooden house which was once a guard booth.
Him they insulted and threatened, explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, which had bought the remains of the North Wing to the demolition company.
He spoke with the enemies of the 0.31s for several days.
And he explained to them that I could not do absolutely nothing for the demolition.
And when it came to pass, that was the most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
200 Enemies of the S21 took the cut mazizo of 80 kilos, with a price per piece of 6.50-14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also with the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest time is sold.
Owner of gardens, landscape gardener, responsible for projects.
They came from everywhere and took what could be in the trunk and above.
The stone of Stuttgart's momentum makes time that became "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"In reality this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Were it not for the political component."
Amounts to their all-terrain, makes a tour by their great Kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, he interrupted his studies, and later biology, interested in computers and finally works with stones.
And lover of the stones.
4,000 Tons of stone houses.
It carries its treasures for all Germany.
He claims to be the largest trafficker of ancient stones of the country.
It slows down.
In the snow, there are artistic chopped sandstone rocks.
"Pertencieron Dresden Marienbrücke bridge," explains.
Limestone alba, yellow, warm, enthusiastic.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Says a lot: red sandstone, a previous piece of Karlsruhe station.
And it continues.
"Beautiful travertine."
The mazizos formerly belonged to the rostrum of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine of the Chief of police of Stuttgart, red granite of the Church Sankt Blasien, toba heilbronner students--viewed hospital.
What worked, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks in as he earlier sculpted stones and moved them with a simple rig and a cart, feels very devout.
"It would be a scandal if something is destroyed."
It has not become rich, immensely rich absolutely.
But today 14 people gave that do to the stone merchant, also stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it is gratifying," says the man that undertakes take advantage of the remains.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones that rescue.
Struggle of potential around big talents
Queen an active flow in the buffet.
16 students crowd around the bread rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the manufacturer of car Vokswagen have been invited to a workshop to students of mechanical engineering and design.
In a kind of contest of ideas, they have to talk about the car of the future with the employees of VW and learn all about Volkswagen.
Rivaling the same way, many companies, such as VW, they meet in a fight melee around the most gifted minds in collaborations with universities.
His mission: recruit students more talented of the universities, as soon as possible before they enter into the labour market and they are employed by others.
And as the universities did not provide publications on the skills of their students, trying to glimpse the exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
The second day of the Technical University of Braunscheig project, the Consortium WINS talent.
A Lady of the personnel Department distributes pens, jelly beans and folders with the VW logo.
It explains excited young talents the internship programs and work for students and shows them their ways in the Consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is the project with VW.
He sees advantages for both sides: "students come in contact with the industry and gain experience."
"At the same time, VW can meet students, look more closely to the interesting candidates and consider them as potential future employees."
Some collaborations, says seal, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are desired so directly.
"The main point was formerly in technical projects," says seal.
The fight for the fresh graduates is becoming tougher.
In many branches, enterprises can not already choose employees among a large pool of applicants.
If that does not have to advertise and, above all, to achieve a workforce highly qualified.
All students in the disciplines of engineering are in an excellent situation for bargaining.
According to the Association German engineers (VDI by its German acronym), in October there were 40,000 posts vacant engineers.
And, according to the prognósticos of the VDI, this vacuum of engineers grow even more.
In the company of audit and advisory services, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of the hunt for talent.
It organizes costly events of recruitment, career KPMG, a type of modern yincana, in which the participants have to find their way through the coordinates of the GPS.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the United States.UU. the following year.
In addition participants may observe affiliates of KPMG and learn about the company.
It is decided who should be in two rounds of election in the output.
Only the crème de la crème of many participants goes to the United States.UU.
Universities strive increasingly choose and polishing high potential of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the career we want to stand out from the mass."
"The simple way by itself only us stayed short."
For the talent scout Dykta the notes give results.
Until today we have a similar action in the last year with all participants."
"Some are close to an end, and want to apply for working with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach in the campus, they are also hunting, above all, small and medium-sized, classical companies with their exhibitions of the work.
"We are trying to get students in specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," said Sitha Stübe, responsible for personnel for the Solarworld solar technology manufacturer.
The company Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems of the new generation.
Currently on the website of the company are 35 vacant posts.
"It is becoming very difficult to fill the vacant posts."
"It costs time and money," he says.
A shortest path is the contact with the teachers of the University.
Solarworld collaborates with many colleges, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"Teachers advise that they can to work with us or make your thesis."
Expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists are not performed.
Why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchy and convenient communication.
"A large consortium usually cannot offer it," declares Stübe, responsible for personnel.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, assistance to children or good possibilities for promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Instituts, Solarworld holds the square 55 among the 100 best employers of Germany.
The Institute produces an annual list of the best German providers of employment.
For which asks the employee satisfied that is with the work and the environment in the same and notes the preliminary conditions of employees.
Stübe, responsible for staff also expected extra points in his classification by their applicants to work.
"I think that the applicant focuses especially on external ratings of a potential employer," says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advised companies wishing a long term strategy is earning a reputation as an employer.
He advised its clients more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to make attractive as employer passes by the employees," says.
In the jargon of the sector is called internal Employer Branding, also promoting corporate identity within the template itself.
"A satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When it is well to the people and what they identify with the company, then gets promotion directly to the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a game with gang," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. State of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico has not appeared in these years no new oil drilling.
The Government of Washington issued a blunt ban and thereby annulled their previous plans on a final basis.
Also to the Atlantic Coast remain new holes closed at the moment.
This announced the Minister of the interior, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, that at least the next five years is valid, is the explosion of the rig "deepwater horizon" in April.
Before the accident that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused the greatest environmental catastrophe in the United States.UU., President Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and the industry.
Supporters wanted thus reducing the dependence of the United States.UU. new supplies of oil from abroad.
So far not been clarified entirely of who is responsible for the irreparable oil slick in the Gulf.
In the Centre of the criticism is the British Energy Consortium BP, which is faced with millions of requests.
A Commission of inquiry to by Obama will present their results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior Minister, lifted the moratorium on drilling after the explosion.
Subsequently, different consortia peteroleros submitted requests for further attempts of drilling.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe using harsh controls and a few more stringent safety regulations.
The supervisory authority responsible for, which has fallen into disrepute, after having been accused of corruption is currently reformed root.
Obama Announces tandem that lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that the full extension in the Gulf will be less due to tighter regulation, so far.
"The Government's plans are the greater brake on the growth of the industries of oil and gas," says the result of the current survey carried out by the consultant company BDO - prior to the ban's removal on Wednesday.
American Energey Alliance is complaining of insecurity in the sector: "Nobody knows what exactly changes with the regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects extend so far, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is corrupted
The water of the rivers is márrón oil, smell like a gas station: millions of dumping gallons of crude oil have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
The people live in theft, corruption and the illegal trade in oil.
Celestine Akpobari feels good.
"Not you tired," reassures the journalists environmental activist: "Today will be sufficient oil before your eyes."
The Nigerian's 37 years has managed to photograph children wading in water up to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence at the surface: the colorful glow of the water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
Do not see that brown patches of oil floating on the surface.
Before you here caught prawns with handfuls, explained Esther Badom in the Bank of the River Bodo-Jetty.
Meanwhile, the flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago was dumped in the formidable wetland an impressive amount of oil by a broken pipe.
The fishes of the vicinity of the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach fish-filled waters: that, in the heart of the Niger delta and located in Ogoniland, is regarded as one of the most apestadas regions of the world.
In the path of the route of the River through mangroves, extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat engine removes a broth Brown, who immerse your hand in the water, will draw some filled with oil.
The roots of mangrove trees rise from the ground as dark licorice sticks, sadly isolate Palms that collide and crash their palms.
Flocks of birds, are searched in vain as if they were in the wetlands as always: as soon as it is silent the barrier from the outside, expands it a sort of ghostly calm of a previous paradise with smell of petrol station.
"What happens here is an ecological struggle," says, sullen, Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
The next item is the war comparison.
The area of the settlement of the ogoni is a heated battlefield for years: here broke more than 60 years ago the first European explorers, here was organized the first resistance in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwalater executed here had to put his first factory in the Shell Consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for the employees of the oil.
Even today the companies return to Ogoniland is prohibited: while every day bombeaban more than two million barrels of black gold in the region of the delta, three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometres of pipesthe oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the Consortium.
Every 200 meters were steel platforms such as bizarre sculptures of water: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the drills.
They have up to 50 years, most have a total corrosion.
Every moment he fails a head, you think Akpobari, then mana a constant stream of oil in the water.
According to the assessments of experts, more than two billion liters are voiced in 50 years in the ecosystem of the delta: year after year, the amount of oil enters, as the ship averia "exxon Valdez" for 21 years in the sea of Alaskaa greater disaster ecólogicas of the history of mankind.
Who is responsible for the lasting environmental region, lidiará with this.
While the consortium of Shell and organized thefts of oil are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see headsets about to break and pipes with leaks as the main cause.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mainly low safety standards normally worldwide conventional, he reproached the scientist Richard Steiner to the Consortium in 2008: indices of defects of pipes are only "on a multiple larger than elsewhere."
In a place, which from a distance it seems forgotten, appears a workshop full of oil under a free sky, emerging figures among the mangroves: are naked and covered in oil.
Among one of the many barrels, that are sometimes United with perforations, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, stands a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil is heated in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the container, later the pipe of oil drips and so goes diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce daily up to four barrels of 300 litres diesel: "Gives us 34,000 naira," around $22.
The inhabitants of the delta take advantage of the shortage of fuel in one of the largest oil States of black Africa.
Only Nigeria has a single refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price in hardly 40 euros-céntimo per litre diesel illegal heaters can offer even less: so cuts the value of its raw material.
It comes from "of the bunkers," which trucaron the network of pipes through Ogoniland: according to experts, this step are lost at least 16 million litres of oil per day in all the Niger delta.
Only an insignificant part of the material stored provisional premium is refined clearly illegal: organized, criminal networks also belong to politicians and senior military officials, who saved the best part in wells and sell it cheaper on the world market.
The Akpobari activist considered purely academic debate on whether the environmental catastrophe is rather to the management of the population or the loose manner of production.
"If the oil companies is not behaving as invasive and they had not destroyed completely the natural habitats of fish, there is no sabotage, theft or illegal refineries."
Whereas the conditions of the ogoni are shattered by Shell to the point that only appears a deduction of the Consortium: "Perhaps is better to present another nationality, such as china."
Michael is nervous.
"It is high time that you desaparezcáis," says the muscular Ölmann.
"The soldiers can come at any minute."
If the special unit of the army to the illegal refiners, not threatened with arrest them, if not with a painful bribery.
The soldiers from the North also want, like all Nigerians, take advantage of the raw material.
"This doomed invention has been torn apart by complete our country," says Akpobari.
The researchers detected dangerous factory defects in the engines for the A380
Apparently, the A380 has a large security issue.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, the researchers found a possible manufacturing defect, which can produce "catastrophic failure" in the engine.
The airline Qantas wants to sue the manufacturer of the engine.
Passengers on the Qantas Airbus made a landing at the beginning of November had more luck than you can imagine: Australian air safety authorities perceived through his research a major security problem in some A380 engines, and warn of a possible defect in factory.
The potential flaw has complicated implications: a connection of sleeves, can cause fatigue fissures or cracks, the authorities of the ATSB announced in a report published Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic engine failure."
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Those among the Qantas Airbus that he had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline starts legal means against the British manufacturer of turbines.
He filed a lawsuit in federal court in Sydney which made possible further legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, he said that his airline may require compensation for the incident from the beginning of November.
In the mark of the motor lost pieces and his wing is deteriorating.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of petrol as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be spare parts.
The Australian researchers announced that they will be more security testing to the superjumbos with affected engines.
The recommendation of security is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesman of ATSB.
The security problem has become in important enough to inform all concerned.
After the landing of the aircraft of Qantas, the airline spent many weeks to land A380 fleet.
Singapore Airlines kept approximately three of his eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa said the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This aircraft with double cover is the world's largest passenger aircraft.
A snowfall across the country causes chaos in traffic
Totally white Germany: from one day to another has snowed almost throughout the country.

The traffic is very limited in the majority of motorways and on many streets.
On the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the snow plow are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong gusts of wind sweeping the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Agency of sea and river basin district of Germany (BSH) hopes alive tides with the 1.2 m water level above its usual level on the coast of the Baltic Sea Schleswig-Holstein.
In Saxony the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems in the motorways and national roads.
According to the weather service Meteomedia, is called the alert red in free Schweiz, in reality the alert higher.
There is partially 30 inches of freshly fallen snow and cold and strong winds are responsible for arremolinar her.
There were trapped during the night many trucks and cars.
Also in Saxony Anhalt, police authorities reported significant turmoil in the streets.
On the A2, the wind and snow paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia the snow affected the A9 and A4.
According to Deutscher Bahn, expect great disorders in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and in the North of Bavaria.
Snow on the road, the trees fallen on the rails or the destroyed catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony is suspended intercity service from Leipzig to Nürnberg.
In Saalfeld, Thuringia a train ICE had to halt his trip to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue services attended the 165 passengers on the train with blankets of wool, food and drink.
The snow winds sweep the streets.
In the biggest German airport, with snow winds caused numerous suspensions of flights.
According to a spokesman for the central of FIR, already some cancellations have been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokesman for Fraport there are already 40 cancelled flights.
The snow plow are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stranded at the airport, despite that there are 400 beds of campaign prepared for them.
In many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there already were many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a crossing of route in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
There was a similar accident because of the snow-covered streets in the vicinity of Nuremberg: also here a truck was hit at a junction of roads because the vehicle was atrancado.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, the route of Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition a 30-year-old woman, died after a roll-over with his car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: the snow will be increasingly smoother and type dust and therefore arremolinará in soft gusts.
But the wind will diminish.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by rapid and strong winds.
You will no doubt continue to very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deutsche Bank looks for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to secede from its symbol: according to an article, the financial institution seeks buyer for their office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutschen Bank settled its headquarters: were modernized the twin towers in the neighborhood of the banks in Frankfurt; While bankers returned to his old workplace.
But now the financial Consortium wants to apparently take advantage of the reonvación costs, and looks for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as says the "Financial Times Deutschland" based on a spokesperson.
The spokesman does not mention the reasons for the sale in project.
"I always check whether owning properties or sell them and then return to rent them," he said.
For this reason the largest credit institution of Germany returns to give up the headquarters of his company after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros of the investor in a Fund of the House and then he made relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached figures of approximately EUR 200 million.
A sale would be much money to the Bank.
Experts in this area estimate the value of the towers of the newspaper renamed "greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
If sold the buildings renovated on a background of the Bank or to an independent investor it has not been revealed today, said the spokesman.
Thousands of people in mourning for the deceased miners
New Zealand, more than 10,000 people think about the buried miners, treated as dead after many explosions in a mine.
Still not be been able to find corpses, because security remains precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago held an intense explosion in the mine Pike River near the town of Greymouth.
ages 17 to 62 29 miners were buried in the mine.
Introduced a probe in the place of misfortune, but he found no sign of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue team could get off for security reasons.
After intense second detonation, the authorities and experts deduced that there was no chance that the miners had survived.
Not have been recovered bodies to date.
Now family and friends remember the dead with a commemorative event.
Ten thousand people have changed with the resplendent glow of the Sun in Greymouth in the South Island New Zealand.
They are silent for two minutes.
In tribute of the buried miners, 29 tables with names of the miners, lamps and helmets were placed.
There were also photographs and personal objects, below clothing and surfboards.
Flags flew at half-staff at government buildings in the country.
New Zealand waited for the miners to return to the surface "of the depths of the Earth," said John Key, the President of the New Zealand Government, the participants of the commemorative event.
"But they never returned home."
Cannot accept the death of his son until that he has not seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Next to the President of the Government and the families of the victims attended the commemorative event many foreign diplomats.
In the first explosion on 19 November were also buried miners of British and South African origin.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire within the coal mine in the island of the South of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been removed, the scorching temperatures of the interior of the mine will start to descend, said Gary Knowles, the superior of the police, journalists.
To the devil, Warrior!
Al gore fits in artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn returns to explore the boundaries of the genre with his epic battles "Walhalla rising."
Have the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn in what public will have thought shooting "Walhalla rising"?
A prisoner with a single eye (Mads Mikkelsen) Viking Warrior is released from their torturers and kills his enemies with nearly superhuman fights, sounds perfect for young viewers seeking bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and start their enemies the guts of their bodies with life when it is of bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, and in fact, called it says almost no word during the entire film and the other characters drift by how much one or two sentences or a couple of painful death screams.
Otherwise keep quiet and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying montuosos landscapes of Scotland, offered by the frames to the Viking world of thousand years ago.
Ideal rather for filmmakers grown and interested in Existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has several target groups it is a pity that they can not be excluded each other.
Director Winding Refn considers its wild and the trilogy about the hairstyle drug dealer "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refused to make their works for everyone with something more humor in the mainstream or something less brutality of the artistic home.
A brain mass and some guts that sprout may not deter the majority of the followers of artistic cinema.
The majority of fans of the action are dying of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of missionaries violent cristioneros interpretable grounds and stays stuck an eternity in the calm and the fog before the team comes to America and back to shut up there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla rising" has not found film distributor in Germany and only published in DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the upstart and bloody facade hides a piece of at times exciting film that deserves some attention.
This film is not dialogue nor a logical action, everything's atmosphere, a feverish dream turned into film.
And that is why there is no escape for the spectators.
Refn is condede just a moment of relaxation and its glacial images and dark trance soundtrack make you a lump in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, ranging from the hearts of the characters towards him.
Only a small young blonde, which supports Unojo faithfully, retains something like innocence, all the others are owned by the ira.
Above all, the hero of one eye, whose motives are not explained ever becomes any time a warrior out of hell to enemies and temporary allies, possibly the same Devil Ambassador.
The represents the downfall, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can hate and admire, to get angry, disturbed and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious movements of Earth
IAEA nuclear energy organization has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this topic until that allow controls.
About the middle of the night from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli warplanes F-15 I attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It lies on the Bank of Euphrates; the city closest to 30 km and greater is Deir as-Saur.
His name appears in documents of the international agency of Atomic Energy (IAEA), is about a reactor that apparently the Syrians were built with the help of Korea of the North in the cube, hidden in a valley that comes out of the River.
According to information from international intelligence in the United States.UU. the CIA at the end of April 2008, is design a current reactor under the name of the vicinity of Al-Kibar very suitable for the production of plutonium to build nuclear weapons.
On the other hand, the technique only serves for other purposes than for the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation on video with blurred satellite images.
They showed an animated computer where were the components of the reactor before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the nuclear power plant in Yongbyon.
They also taught photographs showing the building from nearby or inside.
For some little time that the reactor was operational, he said, but was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is barely known at the time, riddles became larger over time.
The former President of the United States.UU., George w. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite sure that the Syrians had been built in Al-Kibar reactor prior to the attack, but that barely saw evidence that there was "a nuclear weapons program" in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only talk about an "alleged reactor," although they considered "plausible" the presentation of the CIA.
Lack them strong evidence, as well as to the IAEA.
When asked it safe that was to be facing a reactor, a high UN diplomat responded in summer in a lapidary manner that the IAEA has "enough material to have questions."
The Syrians unraveled very quickly from the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and paved the ground thoroughly.
However, in June 2008 a team of the IAEA under the command of the previous chief inspector Olli Heinonen found rastos of uranium in Al-Kibar, which had been made by people.
Furthermore the IAEA got images by satellite on a Member State, commercial vendors in the moments just after the attack, which must have an informational value greater than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs were not the market because an unknown client, perhaps Israel, purchased exclusively.
That is why the IAEA unable to verify its authenticity regardless.
Syria always gave to understand that I had never had a nuclear program secret nor built any reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, explained Damaskus.
The IAEA rejected it as unlikely after the analysis of the particles.
Since then Damaskus refuses to discuss in this regard, in the same way with respect to the images by satellite.
In addition, drivers are prohibited a second inspection at Al-Kibar and the entrance to the ruins of the bombarded building.
Israel is also a strict silence.
"Never discuss you," Ehud Olmert, acting Prime Minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not results since June 2008 and "is transformed progressively into a serious credibility problem for the authorities," as a Western diplomat in high office is a place in the IAEA in ViennaFinally pending a serious infringement of the Treaty of non proliferation of atomic weapons, which ensures the IAEA.
The IAEA considers three teams as the key to progress in the clarification, which should be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others such as these still exist.
The inspectors have not been publicly released so far of what teams are, nor what functions are, or if seem suspicious.
According to the Süddeutschen Zeitung newspaper, the IAEA has designated as an intern at Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from the vicinity of the cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and found a complex of buildings near Masyaf with images by satellite, that very probably one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly is located in or immediately next to a base military, Syria prohibited on this occasion the entry to the three places to the IAEA.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians fear a row that the United States.UU. they have asked the IAEA to spy on the military plants.
Nuclear detectives were warning about teams thanks to the warnings of the secret service of the United States.UU.
Through satellite photos, the IAEA has indications that moves material between the three places and the cube to the Bank of the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat with a senior post in Vienna said that at least one of the teams can be "linked to the production of fuel."
But there is "no indication of sensitive activities," or enrichment of uranium or reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium is not rich.
Where the uranium must come, and where the plutonium for bombs must be separated later to these central questions must, in the best cases, plausible assumptions.
Nor is there doubt about whether the ruins, valuable clues that can be retrieved, are in three places.
As vanished hundreds of cargo trucks from the ground, no one has information about where the rubble remain.
The OIAE considered unlikely the salt mine at Al - השני, situated at few kilometers from Al-Kibar to the other side of the Euphrates, which the Syrians in 1998 recognized his aptitude as an area for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former inspector of the IAEA, her related to the reactor in an analysis of the images by satellite for Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But the pictures from orbit show that the Syrians were movements of land in the three alleged suspected sites and removed large containers once the IAEA request entry.
It may be coincidence but hardly helps to dispel the suspicion.
In addition, the diplomatic sector said that the IAEA had used some months to develop a plan of inspections there, that the Syrians would allow, to keep the possible secret military, single deployment shows the magnitude of the interests of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damaskus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago were tranquilizaron that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter does not have much urgency, since a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a type of Ambassador of the United States.UU. He wields the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, director of the IAEA, which should propose these inspections, spoke of "an option that I am open in the future," but still hesitate.
This road is very risky: this requires the majority of the Council of governorate of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for an escalation.
On the other hand, as reflected a diplomat: "And what happens if at the end they find anything?"
Love in the time of the war
There are problems since that Angelina Jolie began in summer with the direction of his debut yet unnamed.
She has written the script, a love story between a Bosnian and one Serb.
Not much more is known on the subject, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations have protested quickly, which at the last moment they moved some days of shooting planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film was shot in Hungary and the post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of women's organization of victims of the war wrote to the High Commissioner of the United Nations, UNHCR, by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported to a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the Ambassador of the United Nations High Commissioner for refugees.
It is not diplomatic, weeks ago women offered a meeting in Hungary rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
Fail to love stories in the fields of violations, and the position of Jolie thereon betrays victims enough about the script.
Your organization according to the UN refugee High Commissioner has recommended dismiss Jolie as Ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But Jolie what exactly he has written for the scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of culture that read the script, awarded after a strip and tug of war permits recording in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie was not after all.
The young author reiterates that he does not pursue political purposes with his film, is introduced with much effort in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Your content remains vague.
The network runs a second synopsis of the movie that sounds quite different: the lovers were together before the start of the war and return to find when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds significantly different is the variant "rape victim falls for torturer."
It is certain that the film of Jolie really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is "unfair and based on erroneous information."
Currently can achieve peace with the Hollywood hackers: while the script still in the network illegally, like many others previously.
Nothing as far from here
Tonight it finally returns to be good for the Irish.
No trace of grief
On the other hand, the home team dominates on customers of Sweden, Finland and EE.UU.
Fans shout of joy while echoes music high, hitting the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in the Cork sudirlandés, because the players are released, and are, balls of pingpong to vessels of beer from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "beerpong," and the prize for the winner are 500 euros plus a few airline tickets to Las Vegas for the World Championship of beerpong in January.
Cyan Tanner is a quiet type, this bizarre game of drink and the discrete computer actually do not make good friends.
And the 26-year-old boy tries to have fun with it, distract from fulminant question, what will bring you the future.
Fun in Las Vegas isn't in his plans in January will be a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
"It is far from home and I still do not have working there."
At the very least: his girlfriend is waiting for you in Auckland, "of a threw got the job of your dreams as Manager of events, it may be a good sign," says the young woman and smiles.
Because of poor prospects at home, two of the three brothers of Tanners have already sought luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now works as it consultant in London.
Young people are going: there are many families on the island as the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will abandon the country in the near future, predicting the economic experts and the Institute of social research ESRI of Dublin.
Up to 2015 are 200,000 emigrants.
A great loss to this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, comes a migratory wave comparable to that suffered the island in the early 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought a great well-being to the Irish, currently extends the melancholy.
The economic crisis confuses mainly due to the young, well-trained Irish, for which up to now, everything is uphill.
The loss of employment and the social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs to have money in abundance.
But three of every ten men and women under thirty years of age are unemployed.
There are letters in the Irish Times for director at mass of young emigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland all sinks."
"There should be an uprising against the politicians and bankers, but who can, will and lose our country, and thereby to an entire generation."
"The last to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and President of the Union of Irish students see appear a bleak future because the Government only focuses on mounts and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
"Reduce the minimum wage, but do not have strategies to bring new jobs," said the 20-year-old girl.
Watch as fellow range from a few practical not reumneradas to the following.
His greatest concern, explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon attempt to look at this issue in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a fair that offers a service based on the theme of work abroad.
"For those who begin to work, do it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to manage your career," says the Manager.
In your web page appear pictures of a guy surfing in Australia and other practicing snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: work abroad is not how to do it in the galleys, if not involved freedom and fun.
For half a year, Seán O'Donovan knows how is to build something on another site.
Since that already had nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer, currently working with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
They now raise a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January it will to Hanover or Berlin, the next project.
O'Donovan sees his country only a few times because they are working overtime to pay a credit to his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," says, that for a long time for the first time he stepped on the threshold of his house.
"I won money in Germany to a house in Ireland, where I am ever so well."
Laugh at something ashamed and leaves by freezing rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with gardens to the houses, large and expensive cars are parked at the entrance.
O'Donovan bought the House together with her sister for four years for 380,000 euros, 100 percent funded by a loan.
"They were crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he said.
Do you have fear of failure in the credit?
O'Donovan think awhile, serves more hot tea and said: "I do not have children who have to feed and I am young;" "If everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer does not like the complaints heard often today.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, by far, so dramatically as in old times here on the island," he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst that can happen, perhaps with this we are for the first time as Irish."
He laughs and account on his father, that in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he returned and continued life in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner like these ideas.
Stop pending the future and just see how it is life elsewhere.
Already a couple of years in London he worked and why I was not going to go well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But these days there is one thing that worried of greatly: the celebration of his 27 birthday on Friday in Dublin.
It fears that it could degenerate into a farewell party.
"Only, not too many emotions," says and gives a great drink your beer.
"Farewell, it sounds very distressing."
"Better we call a holiday leave, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games it."
The democratic routine
It continues to increase support for democracy in Latin America, as well as support for private companies.
Crime generates greater concern than unemployment.
In addition, much of the region, is to Brazil as a more influential than the United States country.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest survey of the Latinobarómetro conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Given that the survey has been held regularly since 1995, allows to track the changes of attitude in the region.
The results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October, two issues stand out.
The first is the reigning relatively lively humor in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in various countries of the South Pacific coast (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased since a reduced 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
He also grew up in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a large drop in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents of Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries of the zone, are Democrats convinced, which lowers the regional average (see chart 2).
About 44% of respondents in the region declared themselves satisfied with the way it works in practice democracy in his country, the same amount that the year past, but considerably higher than the 25 per cent in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34 per cent said they hoped the Congress of his country and 45% in his Government, the same amount that the year in both cases, but considerably higher in relation to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, the economic turbulence in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact remains that it has been during the global financial crisis probably is due to many Latin American countries were affected by a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a social network of stronger security has helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased marginally in 2009 and which has been again this year, up 32%).
However, mood varies considerably from one country to another (see Figure 4).
The good economic returns of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and violent crime have increased.
For the second time since the surveys began, most respondents in Latin America they mention the crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing the country (see Figure 5).
About 31 per cent stated, be they or a close relative, has been a victim of crime in the past year, a figure that has been reduced from 38% last year and is the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in increased support to private enterprises and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region claim that private firms are indispensable for development, while in 2007 was only 56 per cent (see Figure 6).
About 58% agree to a market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel the same (and 80% support to private companies), although his leftist President, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating private companies.
Brazil is the country exercising greater leadership in the region, as 19% of respondents (compared with 18% last year), followed by the United States (the 9%, same as last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11 per cent a year ago).
However, United States is the considered most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds that title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to the trash
No one expected that the general elections held on November 28 in Haiti were perfect.
However, passed in a way much worse than feared foreigners who try to help the country to pick up after their problems.
Introduced votes at the polls, some people voted several times, ballots thrown in the sewers, destroyed polling stations and acts of intimidation.
Polling stations opened hours late.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to discover where needed to vote.
Some of them, in the end, they gave up.
A dozen of the presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, alleged fraud and called for the cancellation of the elections.
Protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the officer of higher rank in Haiti United Nations, stated that they were "relatively good elections in many ways."
The observers of the Organization of American States and the community of the Caribbean stated, cautiously, that "we do not believe that these irregularities, by serious, necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to his opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing President, and with its candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce preliminary results December 7.
It is expected that the tie-break will be held in January.
Yet all expectations in relation to the elections is not lost.
The two main candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, had withdrawn his initial request when requesting the invalidation of the vote.
But still you may encounter problems if the electoral authority declared that Mr Célestin, which only has support, if any, has reached the second round.
Taking into account that the cholera epidemic raging in the country and more than a million survivors of the earthquake still living in tents, expected a large abstention.
When the time comes, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
Around 250,000 documents of identity, required to vote, yet not had circulated shortly before the elections.
There is much at stake.
Aid donors believe that the election of a popular and legitimate Government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as it has been evident, also think Haitians themselves.
Advance on tiptoe to the Center
In the weeks that have elapsed since lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the President of Argentina, has enjoyed great sympathy among the public that has increased his popularity rating at 20 points, up more than 50%, the highest level reported since his election in 2007.
However, you can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in elections next year will depend on if the clearly affected Mrs Fernandez leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, his predecessor and political partnerNéstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to make economic policy even though his wife happen you as President, had a habit of budgeting that infravaloraban tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed presidential marriage spend additional income at your discretion.
In theory, the Government of Mrs Fernandez lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after the death of Kirchner from a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissenting members of the Peronist movement in power have faced Mrs Fernández.
However, after a chaotic session in which a member gave him a punch another in the face and other members accused the Government of bribery, the Congress decided to reject the budget for 2011.
"I'm not going to discuss," said the President.
The 2010 budget, therefore apply to next year, which will provide the President a margin of action even more when it comes to spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: probably grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but many private estimates, in addition to the wage demands of trade unions, placed about 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made that growth and poverty reduction were their priorities, rather than the control of inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pushed the private sector and made the INDEC, the Institute of statistics, to adapt official inflation statistics.
Moderate President Fernandez now these policies?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and leaders of trade unions.
In addition, its officials claim that they want to limit wage increases to 18% next year.
The economy has been driven by high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the impetus to growth achieved with a great devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps by is why Mrs Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore the financial ties of Argentina with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the Government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that the Fernández Lady is about to enter into an agreement with creditor Governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which he owes about $ 6,700 million.
Kirchner always insisted that this would not imply the supervision of the IMF, as usual.
However, Amado Boudou last month, the Finance Minister, announced that the Fund will provide "technical assistance" to develop a new national consumer price index, which seems the prelude to the cleaning of the INDEC.
It is not clear whether President Fernandez wants to follow policy when end of its mandate, taking into account that it no longer has her husband on his side.
If you do, you will need to win the support of the class average, much of which has tired of kirchnerism.
When Argentines to return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will be declined.
If you want to win other elections, it will have to decide if he repudiates or not, with peace of mind, many of the policies of her husband.
Average China Hurrah
Taiwan voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer Union with the Mainland.
Do you think Taiwan about his big brother to the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, came on November 27 to elect mayors and Councillors in five urban districts in what seems like a broad assessment of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Own Mr Ma has become an advocate of the feelings for the continent, forging innovative business linkages, including a partial free trade pact, the greatest changes in relations with China since 1949.
Mr Ma passed the test, but narrowly.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five elections to City Hall, it failed to obtain the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), who has favored a total independence, Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes compared to 45 per cent of the KMT.
If they had been the presidential elections, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, the proportion of votes of his party has declined by around 8%.
For the first time the PPD was tied with the KMT in the municipalities.
The elections saw the typical elements of the election of Taiwanese, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with flags and light clothes girls dancing.
Also missed the mysterious assassination attempt of rigour.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, Honorary Chairman of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the candidates of the KMT the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young directly to the face, injuring him and killing a passerby.
The funny thing is that it is has not been able to determine whether the man intended to hurt Lien or take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, said Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, planting suspicions about the PPD and causing that voters be inclinasen by the KMT.
Perhaps the only winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that you were not dealing with the issue of the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates spoke of plans of public accommodations and employment creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys de facto independence and loathes the military threat from China.
Therefore, the KMT tends to avoid publicizing its links with the Government in Beijing.
But this time also prevented the PPD encourage sentiment against China.
It responds to the new consciousness that Chinese trade is essential for the economic survival of Taiwan.
For her part, Mr Ma said that it had confirmed that its policy towards China was acceptable for the majority of the Taiwanese.
It is expected that the Government of Beijing continue bribing them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to achieve that Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a Summit on protection of investments and the medical cooperation.
Without a doubt, he would like to also achieve political integration, but the first thing is first thing.
It is best to wait for it to pass the presidential election of 2012 for this.
In any case, the PPD has reinvented itself.
Two years ago was in a bad situation: their former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed accused of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, openly applied explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation of moderate has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs Tsai has been gratefully received as a candidate of the PPD for the Presidency, as well as Su Tseng-chang, who turned mandate under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything possible to demonstrate that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced plans of creation of a group of experts to act as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that they can carry out negotiations without preconditions.
Mrs Tsai told the Taiwanese public that his party represents a "reliable alternative" the hasty approach of Mr Ma with regard to China.
Mr Chen seems furious by the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the candidates of the PPD had better left unemployed if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
Even ordered the Lord Su, a pragmatist, to not submit to the presidential elections.
Even when intercede Mr Chen, the DPP will have difficulties to choose among possible candidates.
The KMT should also be an examination of conscience.
The valuations of Mr Ma have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates have been unwilling to campaign with him.
His lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT says it to restructure his Cabinet, as well as local teams.
Large samples of the PPD suggest that Taiwan support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "will has already crossed the point of no return."
Grammy nominations: the singer of jazz Esperanza Spalding is the surprise in the category of artist choice revelation.
It acts at the request of a Chairman and possibly the people shall be fixed in you.
Esperanza Spalding, the bassist and singer of 26 selected personally by President Obama to perform at the ceremony of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, was one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a nomination for high level in the category of best new artist.
Bearing in mind that Spalding was an acclaimed figure of jazz from his 2008 album, "Hope," the nomination gives pause for thought, but respects the rules of the Grammys according to which must be an artist that does not has released more than three albums before recording which "determines the public identity of that artist."
Their ambitious album of 2010, "chamber music society," no doubt meant a breakthrough and, taking into account its light and pleasing vocal style, as well as great skill with influences from pop, funk and Latin rhythms, is can at least make a distinction between Spalding and the road to the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent to the voters of the Grammys, which lately have been concentrated in the field of jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters did honour rightly "historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trio, an exciting and magnificent disc that was one of the Favorites last year.
Among the competitors of Iyer is veteran saxophonist James Moody with "moody 4b" and keyboard player John Beasley by "positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a strident favorite in New Orleans and regular guest on "Treme," of the HBO was honored in the category of contemporary jazz, that for the rest leans considerably toward the merger on the albums of Stanley ClarkeJohn McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The punk savage of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society won plaudits in the category of groups, competing against the great jazz Chamber of Billy Childs Ensemble and the always risky Dave Holland, whose album live with his octet"Pathways," was a great example of the democratic leadership in the bass in his band.
Grammy Award nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in direction of classic albums
Nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd Edition of the Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machina," for piano and Orchestra, five movements, and Steve Mackey with "dreamhouse," a work for eclectic Orchestra of three movements.
Among the nominees with ties to the Southern California are the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt on his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles," a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based in Los Angeles Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
The nominations of classical music are distributed in thirteen categories that cover albums of Orchestra, Opera, choral and solo.
The category of classical producer of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical album are Bruckner by symphonies No. 3 and no. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey by "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "sacrificium - the art of the Castrati" by various artists; and the "Requiem" by Verdi from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the Opera category, the nominees are Berg by "Lulu" of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "l" Amour de Loin "of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the Orchestra and chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg by "Graffiti" and Shchedrin by "the enchanted wanderer."
The Symphony No. 4 of Pärt premiered on the Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes, was nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to ancient mogul oil Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
The Dorman "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for the performance instrumental soloist with Orchestra.
Los Angeles composer wrote the 15 minute piece specifically for her he touched in Mandolin Avi Avital, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.

In the category of mixture of classic, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for his recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The mosque in Temecula obtains the approval of the Management Committee
The project of mosque for Temecula has received the unanimous support of the Committee on local system after more than five hours of testimony public, often heated.
Critics attacked the project saying that it promotes terrorism and traffic jams.
However, the members of the Commission decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respecting local laws and it would be impressive from the aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christian and Jewish or Baha'i, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, Thursday morning.
"The truth is that, as an American citizen, I am proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"Only that they speak very high."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at six in the afternoon and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people who intercedía for or against the Centre, almost the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the website of the newspaper.
"United States no longer exists," reads one of the comments.
"It's another planet of the apes with Lady Liberty in the sand."
"America has fallen."
Plans for the construction of Islamic centers have also led protests in other parts of the country, including near ground zero, the New York area where the attacks of September 11, 2011.
In the Temecula Valley, the Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has spent years living together without any problems in Riverside County, but wanted a space bigger and better than the warehouse leased a property shared with a manufacturer of filtration of water.
The new mosque in 24.943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and would rise up to 43 feet.
It would take up an area of 4.32 acres in Nicolas Road, about two miles to the East of the Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the municipal Council.
An arsenic-resistant Microbe raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or in other places
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can be used as one of its nutrients arsenic extends the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and, possibly, on other planets.
Although the researchers found the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say that it demonstrates that it is possible that there are forms of life without the main elements that considered to be essential.
"This Agency has a double capacity."
"You can grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes something very peculiar, although it lacks little to actually be a kind of way of life 'alien'," Paul C. w. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in the online edition of Science published Thursday said.
For some time, it is considered that there are six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, may continue to grow after replacing the phosphorus by arsenic.
"He makes you ask yourself what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
He said Anbar, the finding is important in the search for life on planets other than Earth, given that researchers need to be able to recognize the life, know what looks.
The study focuses on a Microbe discovered in the Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, which is not reported details of the discovery, generated a great speculation on the Internet about the possibility of the report to indicate the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It did not.
As the discovery "does show is that it could arise in other planetary environments, organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and the set of"standard"elements that we consider essential to life is perhaps not so fixed"said Charles Cockell, Professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, I United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it shows the substitution of an element on the other in Biochemistry and Basic biochemical structure," added Cockell.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Institute for Astrobiology in NASA, who led the study, focused on the Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from the chemical point of view, therefore speculated that a Microbe exposed to both could replace one on the other.
"Arsenic is toxic primarily because their chemical behavior is similar to the phosphorus."
"May therefore find it complicated to the agencies distinguish them."
"However, arsenic is sufficiently different as to not work as well as phosphorus, which enters and, to put it in a way, it sets the biochemical machinery," explains Anbar.
Researchers collected bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and increasing exposed them to concentrations of arsenic, which managed to adapt and used to grow.
The Microbe grows best with phosphorus, but the fact to prove that he can live with arsenic instead raised the possibility that can exist in a natural way a way of life that uses arsenic, either in other areas of the Earth or another planet or moon where arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea of that arsenic can substitute for phosphorus is not new, but had never found an example that demonstrated that it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early ages of the Earth, noted, so researchers have speculated that the earliest forms of life may have used.
"It suggests that there may be other means of generating life, not only the way in which life formed on Earth once," said Foster, who was not part of the research team of Wolfe-Simon.
The research had the support of NASA, the Department of energy and the national institutes of health.
Found the stolen dogs missing in Compton
There are currently two dogs missing of the stolen four front motel Bellflower, as claimed the officers of the sheriff of the County of Los Angeles on Thursday.
The four dogs in competition, two Akitas and two Corgi Pembroke Welsh, disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the van Chevrolet Express in 2006 which were spending the night, to Bellflower Motel 6, according to noted authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found Wednesday, late at night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Department of the sheriff of the County of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that dogs are well," said Whitmore.
"They are in good condition."
"They have returned with their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to indicate exactly where we found the dogs, in which neighborhood, nor the circumstances of the discovery.
"It is carrying out an investigation."
"We don't want to say anything," said Whitmore.
"We are following some clues."
He could not find the owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, so they made a comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in a county in Downey animal shelter on Wednesday afternoon.
The assistants of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a dog of 3 years, and Didi, a dog of 10 months) had not been damaged.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek sought to exhibit in the area competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of the dogs, remained missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city for the Long Beach AKC/Eukanuba national championship last weekend and were intended to display a Trace.
Other dogs them would exhibit in other competitions scheduled for the days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba Championship, told Peek The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the tour for nearly two months carried out by the couple participating in dog competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard made the check-in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and Park the van right in front of his bedroom window.
They were taken to other three dogs (a boxer, a Parson Russell terrier breeding and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.)
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick fur and would be more fresh.
They left slightly open Windows so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van on Tuesday to six in the morning.
Peek had said that they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was not clear whether a reward would be or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, at the time that the restructuring of MGM gets final approval of the Court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally achieved green light to begin again.
On Thursday, a federal judge of bankruptcies of New York officially approved the plan "prearmado" by creditors to delete about 5 billion dollars in debt, paving the way for the entertainment of 86 company focus its efforts in the production and release of films and television programs.
The ruling on Thursday confirmed that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which is why there are no other legal obstacles so that MGM relaunch under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber, Roger Birnbaumthat they will become the Executive principal of what will be a small study.
The staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM not leaves Chapter 11 when JPMorgan Chase closed a planned $ 500 million of credit instrument, to finance the operations and the new MGM Productions.
The Investment Bank is currently stating the credit, which on its own is contributing with us $ 75 million, and is expected to be financed in mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the Bank of investment Moelis and Co. He was hired to provide advice on the management to order their finances, while he was struggling to make payments of interest on $ 300 million a year.
In the month of August, the Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and recovery of companies in bankruptcy expert, known for his work on Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts of Moelis and Cooper of resolving the financial plight of MGM and satisfy creditors more than 140 of the study, required much more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009, the parties agreed to sell the company.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than 2 thousand million dollars seeking creditors.
By the spring of this year, he returned to the drawing board while the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally endorsed by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially exit from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for his work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $ 1.2 million, will receive a payment of $ 9.5 million.
The Cooper companies, who have been raising $375,000 per month for their services of administration of the company, will receive a "success fee" of $ 4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only a movie this year, and held an annual slate of seven or eight movies that will come in 2012.
Also plan to cofinance two films based on "The Hobbit," along with Warner Bros..
The study needs to conclude a loan separate 265 to 275 million dollars to fund its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns 18% of the debt of MGM, had been trying to arrange a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent talks between the two companies were not in agreement.
Tech Toys wants to balance its budget for gifts
While the iPad is the leading candidate to be the toy more wonderful this year, followed by, perhaps, the game Microsoft Kinect system, both can mean a significant dent in your budget for gifts.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 each, and a game Kinect costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes with accounts, or approximately 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently went to three vendors of national toys, Wal-Mart, Toys "r" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see that electronic toys could be bought for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law has been working; the technological toy of this year is likely to have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year.
In addition, while there are usually fewer new toys with partner sites, two of the best known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And toys driven by button batteries are increasing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are Toys "r" Us, unless it is indicated otherwise).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are the size of a Guinea pig stuffed toys to sing a note when tighten their bellies.
A handshake is equivalent to a note, and a second handshake begins to assemble a song.
If you purchase more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: once you start to tighten, it cannot stop.
For singing combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Taking given the technology of Elmo Live of last year, the animatronic of 14-inch doll plays games of change of turn as Simóm says, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative feet articulated with wheels with locking device.
The children who tested the toy used to Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about the lack of a volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, he can't remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of letters of questions designed to make a tour of the car at a meeting with a workbook of witty self-correction.
If you are unfriendly to give your child your smart phone, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60 dollars, from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and the easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; Although games do not taught as effectively as the Leapster Explorer (70 dollars, from 3 to 12 years), is the first tuning important Leapster line, with a new and bright screen.
Any version is compatible with the old cartridges.
iXL of Fisher-Price (90 dollars, from 3 to 7 years) uses a system of the type iTunes to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot which allows to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a set of five blocks barely bigger than a box of matches, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to assemble words by placing the blocks in a row before the end of the time; It is formidable to an improvised competition of assembling of words.
They are more and more toys that have some kind of connection online.
Based only on their presence in toy shops, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2 "Mix" N Match Figure Pack, ($5, from 6 to 12 years) which includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you exchange the code online, your child gets enough credit in the store of Club Penguin for two articles.
These may include wheeled skates or a toy pet Puffle.
Slightly larger than the sow of his toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and over) is the latest in a line of microrobots driven button batteries.
The false insect moves quickly on 12 legs of silicone that vibrate in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the exit.
It is also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even go a bit into the mouth of our dog.
Promotes a more moderate side of the maintenance of order in China
As a Sergeant instructor urban, Tang Shenbin marked the passage in a square of the city, inspecting severely nerve persons responsible, by issuing orders quietly with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan, corpulent policemen of the urban order of China, feared and despised by his capricious crackdown and his inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Strong!"
"Attention!"
"Show them, he whispered,"How are the nice girls"!"
Four girls who just passed adolescence with white gloves and jackets identical olive green and tight pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed on top of the hair tied with ribbons blue and white stripes.
"I personally think that are normal in appearance," said Mr. Tang, contemptuously.
"The models are cute."
More than one Government has sought to clean up the image of China urban inspectors.
A city ordered that all new recruits have a Bachelor's degree.
Guangdong Province changed the grey-green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force by intimidating gaze: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a he/she snacks cart, and noted it with the frown constantly fruncido for half an hour, the Peddler picked up her things and left.
Xindu, a city district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added to its urban police 13 women, specifically chosen by your appearance, share, and youth.
The idea is to give the rough police a more soft, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase the infimum respect for China to these squadrons of the city.
And for good reason, critics argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce ordinances of the city, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But China's news media routinely portrayed a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the Hubei Province killed shock a passerby after using his cell phone to film them while they dissolve a protest against a landfill of waste.
Last year, a manual on training for inspectors of Beijing was stolen and posted on the internet, which is described as flogging effectively criminals without making them bleed.
This year, a peddler of watermelons in Shanghai suffered brain damage after a fight with five officers.
A full of violence, available for download online, video game presents inspectors trained by the Chinese that attack from street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a scar in the Government," lamented China Daily, a national publication, the year after another dispute over tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a really meticulous cleaning."
Skeptics say that the current approach is very far from this.
Once the district requested eight new female recruits through a notice in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News asked whether women had Royal duties or were simply a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The notice of the district called for female candidates from 18 to 22 years, with a good figure "and five harmonious facial traits."
They should have a height above the average, more than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
The retirement at the age of 26 years is mandatory.
Officials said that the work was physically too hard for women with more than 25 years.
"His image is the important thing," said an anonymous official of Rednet.com district, a quasi governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities."
The female chengguan are vases, he said, and added, "as well as vases, have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the Office of administration of the town in the district, is not eager to support that description.
But he noted that the requirements of height were standard in many Chinese work notices for both sexes.
Then comes the requirement for harmonious facial features.
If this means be bet, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not occur.
"We can not allow that a lame person or a hunchback come to work here," said Mr Zheng.
"His image would not be well."
Liu Yi, who patrol the Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with their colorful cheeks and a mouth curved subtly.
She does not believe that the accent in its appearance is sexist, it said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic eye.
His co-worker with dimples, Xu Yang, of 21 years, said "our work must present the image of the city."
They also oppose his time certain work, said, because they're career ambitions greater than to simply flush out vendors in the streets where it is supposed that they confined their business.
Every morning, the Squadron is facing more or less a dozen vendors that are launched on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell so many rolls or tofu bowls as possible before being thrown.
"Mr Wang, has to leave."
"You have said many times!" said the Lady Xu as a salesman escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning her chariot drawn by bike with side dishes of noodles.
Officials describe as more monotonous than strenuous duties.
"This is more or less the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, 20-year-old, who studied marketing at their free hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts of confiscating the goods of the vendors.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their supervisors men.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against the bureaucracy, which are common in all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, rioted once spread the false rumor that a few official chengguan had murdered a salesman.
More than a dozen of police or official chengguan were injured in the night episode; 14 vehicles of the Government were flushed or taken fire.
By the time Xindu has avoided such violence.
But the calm is hardly guaranteed.
Only on two streets of the quiet Baoguang Plaza, where the female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as required by the regulation.
The owner of the motorbike shouted rudely.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes prior to the officers, with bad side, opening way to the nudges into their vehicles and were quickly with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the men's squad, stayed behind, with his return given white badge to hide his name.
As female officers, coordinators, 40 years or older, men play a purely supporting role.
Unlike them, not they are taught to retain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"It we sometimes fight physically," said Mr Li with total naturalness.
"Most of the time is the public which begins the fight."
Prosecutors did not lift charges against Senator Ensign
The lawyers of the Senator announced on Wednesday that the Justice Department prosecutors have eventually acquitted at the Senator John Ensign of the criminal charges arising from his affair with a former Assistant of campaign and its efforts to ensure work through lobbying for the husband of the woman.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican, who was considered as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair was national headlines last year and he damaged his career.
The Ensign Office said was "certainly pleased" by the decision, which came after an investigation of an entire year.
The Senator could still face disciplinary action from the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign lawyers said that the Department of Justice had been "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of its investigation and that it has no plans to lift charges against him for this item."
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many lawyers of ethics outside the Department of Justice, who said that there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign could have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, email and other documents disseminated first in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain lucrative work through lobbyto achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the affair by the Senator with her.
The Lady Hampton once worked as a Treasurer of a campaign of Ensign.
Ensign was in contact with several political sponsors to find work to Lord Hampton and advocated on behalf of them once they had been recruited to Lord Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an Assistant to Ensign, he was excluded according to the law of lobbying for your former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared at odds with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban," which seeks to restrict that former State employees use their connections to personal business.
Of the evidence which has become public, "seemed be a case of prima facie of a conspiracy for substantially violating the Statute revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a lawyer from Washington that specializes in defending clients investigated by the Government.
While the Department of justice officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case of Ensign, Mr Brand and other lawyers of ethics said that the Department seemed cautious in accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for his public integrity section, including the decision of last year to abandon the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, amid charges of misconduct of procedure.
The fiscal Federal "are clearly a few cowards," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that the high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, the main lawyer for Ensign, said in an interview that received a phone call from a public prosecutor of the Department of Justice and another call to the next day, telling him that the Department did not want to raise charges against his client on Monday.
The defence of Ensign team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the Senator, and his Office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "acted according to the law."
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments which he gave to prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they took the fair decision," said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a complaint separated by the Group on ethics, which alleges that a payment of $96,000 for the parents of Ensign to the Hampton violated federal election law.
The electoral Commission said he had no sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the money was a gift.
NV Energy is a major company of Nevada which had supported for a long time the Senator, which got a job through lobby thanks to Ensign given to Hampton.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company agreed to Hampton as a lobbyist, the Chief of staff of Ensign, John Lopez, communicated with Hampton and told him that he was "crushing" the Ministry of the Interior on a matter in dispute.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another client of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and called the Secretary of transportation to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline when it had contracted with Hampton to lobbying.
When for the first last year came the news of the affair, Ensign asked forgiveness to their constituents and resigned from his position as the fourth leading Republican in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told journalists that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign, Jennifer Cooper, spokesman announced that Ensign was no longer subject to a criminal investigation, it said that Senator expects that the Ethics Committee quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and conclude its investigation.
"Senator Ensign has a desire to continue their hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
The appeal of Cheshire will aim at Twitter
There were half a dozen of these "chatting" in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minute to minute, sent reports of the appalling testimony via Twitter.
In the end, said the defense, had over 140,000 messages from Twitter on the process that addressed rape and children tied to their beds in a House that was on fire.
On Thursday, the process widely followed by Steven j. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family of Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to reach a final official, with the imposition of the judge of the capital punishment voted by the jury.
But lawyers for Mr Hayes have been written in the Court that delineate the arguments of the appeals that will probably play to the courts for years.
One of the more provocative claims that intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by the journalists of mass media, created "a circus atmosphere," and such widespread and immediate saturation with exaltadores details made public passions to exercise improper influence on the jury.
The claim could force judges of appeal to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"According to what I experienced during this process, I think that there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the courtroom is affecting the rights of the individual to have a process fair," said Thomas J.. Ullmannprincipal lawyer of the defence of Mr Hayes.
The trial judge Jon C. Blue, the State High Court, rejected laconically demands in a ruling last week, saying that the news media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury has been led by the passion.
But probably it will not be the last word on the subject.
For decades, the appellate courts have recognized that the coverage of cases celebres can generate questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of United States reversed the conviction of an osteopath of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard case vs. Maxwell, who had "an atmosphere of Carnival in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the TV show and movie "The fugitive."
Some lawyers said that the courts of appeal which considered the conviction of Mr Hayes half a century later, might be intrigued by the argument that might be needed new rules to control the form of communication from the Chambers of the tribunalsomewhat inimaginadable at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason for concern over the impact of new media of communication" in processes of high-profile, said John j. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford School of laws, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report which stated that it was imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said that some judges of appeal might be intrigued by the idea that limit the immediate communication from the Chambers of the tribunal could do that the trials were fair.
Twitter is just one of many of the issues outlined by the lawyers of Hayes, who probably will be discussed for years, delaying implementation.
The defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been prejudiced when the Blue judge refused to let them that they testearan the reactions of potential jurors, showing grisly pictures of the scene of the crime during the selection of the jury.
Some jurors said that they were horrified by pictures of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and her daughters, Hayley, Michaela of 11 and 17.
Defense attorneys say they also us the constitutionality of the death penalty and will argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury who had criticized the prosecutors, and that had improperly lobbied for a verdict by his bizarre decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not abducted.
But his arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract the most interest.
They noted in a challenge to the verdict filed the month passed the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for Governor and the Senate of United States.
They argued that the media continually missed fuel to the fire of emotion on the case.
"The daily agglomeration of the tweets of the media, cameras and reporters outside the Court," the lawyers wrote, "it was something never seen here in New Haven, and perhaps in the entire State."
Its attention on the coverage of Tweeter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists claim that the complaint on the fact that the immediate news were more important that the reports delivered more slowly, were a vision Luddite which would make the policy of the Court on the control of the coverage was weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that the appellate courts often were attracted by the arguments on the adjustment required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes lawyers are pressing for this claim.
In his letter, referred to the decision of 1966 of the Supreme Court, which repeals the condemnation of Dr. Sheppard due to the coverage of the process, and made it clear that they would require that new media require new rules.
"This case," wrote, "represents the Sheppard case vs." "Maxwell of the twenty-first century."
Can the civility make a bridge to join the divisions?
After a remarkable campaign by the invective and negativity, this week has sparked a bit of civility in Washington.
It is a harbinger of a genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan fighting in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress did not produce any progress on the great issues that should be treated during the outgoing session.
But by what they say all, it was at least a polite discussion on the differences of the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibility to govern, rather than be another empty episode to score partisan points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the Commission from the President's deficit was equally civilized, despite political differences that exist between the members.
It seems clear that close over a period of months interaction generated a mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates the members.
That's hardly enough to declare that it has come to a new era of cooperation.
Both parties are now in a period of testing, probing each other to identify signs of cooperativism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters for a renewed partisan war.
Reason by which the Tuesday meeting and subsequent evaluations by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or allegations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and are very deeply rooted as to suggest any rapid change in the climate that existed during the last two years.
Whether that you be taxes, spending, health care or social assistance, both parties are at opposite poles.
However, the election of November has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with respect to the manner of saying things," said Pete Wehner, an official of the Bush administration now at the Center for ethics and public policy.
"They are inevitable after the elections."
The elections are partisan passions, which then die.
"That's good."
On some issues, notably those contained in the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice that finding a solution.
The Bush tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both sides want to find a way of preserving some or all the reductions, either permanent or temporary.
Similarly, it is likely that there is a commitment to extend unemployment benefits, probably because the Republicans are not allowed to believe that they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, to deny unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House, there is greater optimism for possible treatment on these issues during the outgoing session, together with the ratification of the new Covenant of nuclear disarmament START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution, warned that the successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not lead necessarily to a continuous bipartisanship when the new 112do. Congress meets in January.
On the other hand, it stated that it is very likely and even inevitable, to begin a period of disagreement.
"Once things you must do to be carried out, in the short term psychology reverse the situation to one of confrontation" said.
Wehner, also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) on the fact that the civility can lead to genuine cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012," said.
The reasons have much to do with the Constitution of the new majority Republican in the House and the Tea Party voters, that contributed decisively to its creation.
For more aware leaders Republicans about the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know that they must try to meet promises to cut the expenses of the State and cancel the new health law.
These partisan lines are already clearly seen in initial reactions to the recommendations of the Commission's deficit, including the reform of the tax code and the increase in some taxes and retirement age, and the cost-cutting.
The co-chairs Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson have been commissioned from one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to its own assessment, have been introduced to force the issue of the deficit in the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the Committee's 18 members to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been fighting to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials on the panel, suggesting in fiscal issues there, at least currently, few bases or desire to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles among the Republicans in the White House and Congress.
The first will happen next year when Republicans challenge to Obama on the budget, taxes and aid provider, followed then by a period of more bipartisan cooperation in the form of partisan clashes.
What it would provoke the change?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still wants to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead end, as it did in 1995, then both parties observe with care the reaction of the people.
Anyone who consider that it is probably losing will change course and search for compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are currently higher than were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a big ideological gap between Obama and Republicans in the Congress which had between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, civilism shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked us document portrays to Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "kleptocracy," and leaves a part of the bribes and money of protection which raises directly to the Kremlin, as reported in February by the US Embassy in Russia.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service manage huge systems of blackmail, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only legitimate businesses, but also crime syndicates.
Each layer of bureaucracy, which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical authority," takes its part as the money goes up the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its web site Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while still Mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a clean-up since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, which owns a major construction company, have consistently denied accusations of corruption over the years, and he has won several demands for libel on such accusations.
In September, when on a Russian TV channel asked about a documentary that suggested that it was corrupt, said: "It is crazy, a humbug, a nuisance."
According to polls, Russians believe overwhelmingly that your society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the report of the Embassy, and are outrageous that diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
"The direct links of the Government of the city of Moscow with crime have led some to call it 'dysfunctional', and to affirm that the Government is working more as a kleptocracy that as a Government," said the note.
"The criminal elements have a 'krysha' (a term in the criminal world and the mafia which literally means"roof"or protection) that crossed the police, the Federal Security Service (FSS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the Office of the Prosecutor"as well as all levels of the bureaucracy of the Government of Moscow.
"Analysts identify a structure of three levels in the criminal underworld of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSS, the MVD, and the militia are at the second level."
"Finally, common criminals and the corrupt inspectors are at the most low."
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS collects the money from the largest companies, and that police are targeted at small businesses.
A source, said the report, "explained that Moscow business owners understand it's best to get the protection of the MVD and SFS (instead of the organized crime groups) that they not only have more weapons, resources and power that criminal groups"," but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, the protection against criminal gangs is not more a priority."
Note notes that, while the fundraising is complete, the protection can be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses closed by a pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times on the fight against corruption, but has confessed that little progress has been achieved.
The note from the Embassy reports on men taking luggage, probably full of cash, within the same Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of the Group of experts of Indem in Moscow, in an interview recently.
"But he is a part of this bureaucracy."
"He not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimated that corruption costs Russia more than 300 billion dollars per year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption carried out by non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked at number 154 countries are classified in at least the more corrupt).
The revelation of the note by the United States Embassy, which did not happen until late at night time in Moscow, will surely cause displeasure within the Russian Government, and while Luzhkov can be blamed for the weaknesses of MoscowIt could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for the CNN for Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted angrily by a revelation stating that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this is related to our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, does not suspect that this would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, that it was done in a way so immoral."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past
In a weakly lighted, with walls stained and descascaradas specific classroom, the director of the school secondary Anlong Veng reminded the man that her had built, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Here everyone love Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and was concerned about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, for 42 years.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality during the reign of the Khmer Rouge, Commander remains popular in this remote former stronghold of the Khmer Rouge in Northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrender to the Government, sustained for a long time loyalty is being finally challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed the victims that they publicly confront persons who had participated in the regime.
In June, the Government here distributed a textbook of high school that first teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of his former soldiers.
In July, a mixed tribunal of the United Nations and Cambodia issued the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentencing the former head of the famous centre of torture Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, the anxiety has grown among veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng, complicating the efforts for reconciliation and his attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they can do nothing," said Chhang Youk, director of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is creating divisions within families."
During the reign of the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, they were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork, approximately 1.7 million people.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Government led by Pol Pot, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and the jungles of Western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations would lead to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of combatants of the Khmer Rouge began to defect to the Governmentculminating in the surrender of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by Government forces in 1999 in the Dangrek mountains nearby.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while waiting for the process.
Without the support of its benefactors, most former combatants of the Khmer Rouge fell in absolute poverty which is common in rural Cambodia, and many are nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite of the Khmer Rouge officers retained their local administrative posts in exchange for lay down their arms, the rank-and-file soldiers are still poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have obtained little benefit after the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised without any way to do business."
Lim SR., 55-year-old, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, he fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before devoting himself to life as poor in 1998 rice farmer.
"Life with the Khmer Rouge was well," said.
"Ta Mok gave food to all."
"But now life is difficult because we need to self-sufficient us."
The current tribunal of the Khmer Rouge has also caused concerns here.
Early next year, it is expected that the tribunal start prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The mandate of the tribunal is the process to key leaders and those of greater accountability for the crimes, but has not said whether it will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This is not helped much to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64-year-old, who was a head of district in Banteay Meanchey province during the rule of the Khmer Rouge in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she said the researchers of the documentation center of Cambodia which had overseen the construction of the dam of Trapeang Thma, a project in which it is thought that thousands of forced laborers have died.
During an afternoon shameful recent, Im Chaem returned from work in the fields to his home on piles of wood in a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the Sun threw long shadows on the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She said that if the tribunal convened her not presented.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," said.
"If there is more processing, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the Court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians this question.
"Cambodia should dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But dealing with the past is precisely that Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is back together the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our obligation to meet these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The Center produced the first book of text approved by the Khmer Rouge Government, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea," of 75 pages.
It was distributed in June as a supplement to the textbook of history of high school of the Ministry of education, which contains fewer than four pages on the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng.
As in most parts of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng knows few details about the Khmer Rouge, although the link of the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, aged 19, a student at the high school of Anlong Veng, said that the new textbook helped students to understand an important part of its history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the Court," he said.
"They have suspicion because they are not sure about the number of people that will process the Court."
Such resistance has made that the reconciliation process is complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the textbook and the tribunal are beginning to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge kept a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a rusty tin roof.
The body of Pol Pot was here burned on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a seller of cell phones on the edge of the road, said that I did not know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people go there to pray," said.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea, and later that day decided to walk to the place of the last rest of Pol Pot, which would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of having good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up his reserve of uranium qualified for armament
In a surprise victory for the campaign of President Obama to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarus Government announced on Wednesday to give up his reserve of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released before the Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton should meet with the Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergei Martynov Belarusian, out of a Summit of security.
For years, the U.S. Government had been trying to persuade Belarus to relinquish its highly enriched uranium and seemed that they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But US officials told the Washington Post that took place a couple of operations classified with Belarus in the past two months, to remove 84,82 kg of uranium qualified for armament of a Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for the agreement on Wednesday to withdraw the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from the anonymity due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the Summit of Nuclear security of 47 Nations chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic at the next Summit in 2012.
"I really was fascinated by the fact that wanted a place in the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit."
"This demonstrates that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, President of the society for Global security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said that the agreement is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the American Government has assisted six countries to get rid of all its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George w. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Safety Summit, the Belarusian President, Alexander Lukashenko, had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept the highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically uranium qualified for weapons) and low enriched uranium," said Lukashenka at that time.
"This is our raw material... we are not going to make dirty bombs, and are not going to sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, it's all."
Belarus however, approached the United States earlier this year, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials claimed that the first task of removing the uranium of Belarus, in October, was particularly complicated, that the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said that it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was made in aircraft.
The US Government spent 13 million dollars for the tasks, and most of the money was used to provide the installation of research with enriched uranium to Belarus bass, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Department of energy who works in the Global threat reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to build confidence" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of qualified uranium for weapons, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will attempt to remove its reservation by 2012, according to the Joint Declaration.
Belarus-the United States relations have been strained for years, mainly due to the harsh suppression of Lukashenko's human rights.
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a potential strain.
It stated that "while it welcomes the progress on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus continues to be a central theme to improve bilateral relations"," and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish Government did not objections to the CIA flights
The Government Spanish not made objections the CIA flights with Taliban prisoners and Al-Qaeda with direction to Guantánamo by territory Spanish, as expressed in a telegram to the US Ambassador to Madrid.
As is reflected in the leaked documents (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where added that the then Vice President of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, requested that the Spanish Executive was informed to "prove that they exercised a monitoring appropriate foreign aircraft passing through Spain."
In June 2006, following a report of the Council of Europe, in which he accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting took place between the former U.S. Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice President acknowledged that the report of the Council "had caught the Government of Zapatero out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objections to the flights of intelligence through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "caught unawares," wrote Aguirre in a cable.
Also the then-owner of foreign, Miguel Angel Moratinos, told the Ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest profile possible, although, to be in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited ability to influence."
Furthermore, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González were transmitted to the Embassy who would not try to block the initiative of the judge to order the declassification of the documents of the National Center of intelligence (CNI) and the Ministry of defence on the flights of the CIA.
"These reports do not contain any piece or any sensitive information," he explained the Embassy after talking with the Prosecutor.
However, us reflected its concern by "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors," rather than by information total the INF or the Ministry of defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to handle the case quietly between Governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007 in a lunch between the US Ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, it commented that "Although the Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had given instructions to his staff "to ensure that they avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric"," in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The Ambassador also expresses its concern for the actions of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its pro-American general guidance, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Government of Zapatero tolerated or deliberately ignored actions of USA which could be interpreted as violations of human rights"," even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US Government," said.

The popular would win 4 seats in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the important increase of votes and members experienced in the recent elections, the Catalan PP already has an eye in general because there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes that this training obtained in those elections often turn the receiver on the Catalan.
Thus, the popular Catalan obtained 610.473 votes in the 2008 General, while in the autonomous community of 2006, the figure rose to 316.222.
On Sunday, the PPC won 384.091 votes.
To maintain this upward trend, which has nourished a transfer of votes of the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, this training analysts have calculated that, if general elections are held, the PPC could pass from 8 to 12 deputies in the Congress, while CiU would also win four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less that 9 Deputies (has 25).
These calculations constatarían the Catalan square is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular, ERC would lose a member - you now have three - while ICV would get a member or would win one.
But, keep the electoral timetable, the most immediate appointment will take place in May of 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of the Socialist hegemony in four provincial capitals and in their relief at the forefront of the Diputació de Barcelonaan administration that more budget handles - 661 million euros in 2011.
Both nationalist and popular agree on the possibility of the PSC losing the city councils of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Girona, where the Socialists would not gain majority or recourse to its traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, would not be unreasonable to this formation lost its representation in the consistory of Barcelona - is needed to obtain 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to star in the turnaround in the Tarragona capital, where he ruled with the PP before the current Socialist Mayor, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP has placed only to 500 votes of the PSC, whose Mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this final campaign, met on several occasions.

The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
Seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by officers of the General information of the police station in Barcelona forming a cell jihadist, directed from Thailand, he provided passports to different groups of Al-Qaeda, among them "Los Tigres for the liberation of la land Tamil" (LTTE) and "laskar e taiba" (let), author of this last of the attacks in Bombay that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that the "Kampai operation" has been "weakened" the appliance of forgery of Al Qaeda to international level and, therefore, "operational."
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years that has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where were counterfeit and then distributed to the groups that make up the Galaxy criminal Al Qaeda so that their "fighters" to cross the borders of Europe and other Western with total impunity.
The destamantelada cell is not the only the jihadist network was operational in Europe, hence the research involved, as well as the Thai facilities, other European police units, which is why it is possible that in EU territory is carried out in the next few days shots similar to the one developed in the night of the last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (detained Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another in Thailand was developed with the capture of Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt Pakistanis and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were people heading from Bangkok cell settled in Spain and in other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - stole passports that comply with the requirements set by the so-called "World Islamic Front" mainly to tourists.
Documents is to say, should be in the name of males aged 25 to 45, with a period of several years and stamped visas.
Media Research emphasizes that, for the moment, has been no data linking to those arrested in Catalonia with the Mumbai attack, despite the fact that the perpetrator of this attack, "laskar e taiba," was one of the recipient of the passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that days before that was committed this attack, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer agent a few thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of cards of mobile phones that they were then used by members of the "command" which ended up with 106 people.
Police have seized extensive documentation.
The PP requires at most Park tax concert
The leader of the CFP, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday of exposing him personally to Artur Mas conditions to support his inauguration as President of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and that are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and without edge-sovereigntists adventures, as it is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to put in the middle of its mandate.
The President of the popular Catalan attended the meeting of Artur Mas with safety giving have had 18 deputies in the elections of last Sunday, a figure more than enough to make love, since the CiU candidate needs at least one of the formations which shall exercise the opposition abstain in the vote of investiture.
A possible entente with the PP dependent on future alliances that nationalists want to keep in Congress when general elections are held, but for now, the talks these days maintains more with other political leaders become in Catalan key.
And in regards to the President of the PP, to support an investiture "will have to park all the speeches sovereignty and independence," as well as economic - similar to the Basque - concert that convergent leader aims to even submit to referendum.
Both leaders do have in common their bet by slimming the political apparatus of a very bloated regional administration and the Elimination of the tax on inheritance and donations.
The details of the negotiations on the investiture of Mas deal, part of the CFP, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition-, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today it will do so with Joan puigcercós I Boixassa (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home stated that the deaths were not for "lack of action"
The owners of the Centre of Olot not ruled out that his celador kill more than 11 elderly
Those responsible for the nursing home La Caritat of Olot (Girona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage that has been caused to the institution the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who was while there employee killed at least eleven elders who had resigned.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by counsel of the Center, the lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of the Caritat would be able to exercise the prosecution against the person in charge" of deaths but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil responsibility."
And it is that in addition to the social disrepute that he may be the entity for not detecting on time the criminal activities of celador, the great threat to La Caritat now charged form of substantial compensation are already calculating the legal representatives of the families of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime goes back to August of 2009 and that since then he has continued killing.
The judge already pointed out in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - old patients in the nursing home - that suspected that in many cases, a doctor personally explored the dead but that, in response to the age and the pathologies of the patientsshipped the transaction over the phone.
Caritat, through its director, yesterday flatly refused this end and noted that "the lack of measures not may have been at any time the cause of what has happened."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the case not a single indication that there has been a reckless action by any other person other than the accused himself."
The already known as "Angel of death" confessed the day before yesterday 11 murders and explained that the first crime committed it on August 29, 2009 for a month and half later, killing a second grandmother.
In this case it resulted in the death by clicking him an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime that committed it to helping a mixture of sedating pills.
The director of La Caritat points that it is difficult to control that the staff of the Centre has access to medicines.
The puncture of insulin and the cocktail of sedatives would have been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in an effort to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used for killing them.
But the analysis that are being made in the laboratory that should clarify whether Vila does not lie and sought for their first victims a less cruel death or if, on the other hand, it seared them inside giving them bleach as it has already confessed that he made with the three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat not give credibility to demonstrations by the celador, not even to the number of confessed murders, which does not rule out it to be superior, and justified his attitude in the various versions given Vila in his visits to the Court and in the little sense that has to change their way of proceeding after having committed, with success, eight murders.
That's why they say that they are at the disposal of Justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB is threatening
Investors reacted sharply yesterday the threat yesterday Trichet warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
Peripherals spreads have been closed with force and the actions of the European banks have risen by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the capacity of the ECB of being wrong and the euro has barely both which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is a market ilíquido that just as it collapses recovers but motivated by very speculative and short positions closure.
The institutional investor will soon lose their fear.
A month ago the ECB we cited today to withdraw liquidity measures and will be back tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining.
The Bundesbank required to finalize the purchase of public debt by ineffective plan and eliminate all the extraordinary measures of liquidity to term and leaving only unlimited access week.
After the Irish crisis we hope that the current liquidity measures they extension "at least until March," and keep the quarterly auction with unlimited access to the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope to continue with its program of buying bonds and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they fail to meet the expectations reversed the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they are still obcecados on remove measures of liquidity, that Dios help us!
As at its meeting in may in which stated that not had not covered the purchase of bonds and collapsed the markets, tomorrow it could be repeated the story.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In may it announced the Bazooka Monday and on Wednesday said that already had purchased lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The only treasure issued 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 billion to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still in Portugal rates fell 30 basis points on the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, has become public figures in the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated figures are around 10 billion short term and other 15,000 potential and have until February to raise private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland does not have any credibility after not detecting the problem with the stress test in July, the figures are acceptable within the aid Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and still does not have enough support, so that Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of his speech to relax the tension with a view to the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14 at which need a political commitment to show that we are a Union and that all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play the anthem of the joy of Beethoven to Wagner and the rest.
In Spain, the President had the gift of the opportunity yesterday introducing the plan of action to be adopted on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Reform of pension, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, reduction of the deficits, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive employment ringing in ears of investors as the four seasons by Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish stock market has gone up 4.5%, double that of the rest of European stock exchanges.
In contrast to February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and strong and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
There is today a key a bonus auction to three years will be benefited by the Trichet effect so hope that I was resolved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
For Spain ask an assistance Plan would be a detonation.
Give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury have more than 40 billion in cash on hand three times in March, to extremely expensive types and you closed access to the markets sine hablará.
However, the strategy should continue to be one of Caesar's wife, "and as such, appear to be so."
Spirit, we can.
The President of Eulen impugnará the Board of Vega Sicilia by his sons
The storm abates not in open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and the Juniper.
David Alvarez, founder of the group, impugnará, considered "null full," the judicial Board of the Juniper on the next 16th, requested by five of his seven children and which will seek to enforce their majority and do with the bodies of management of the holding firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesus David and Maria José are refined legal drums for the new judicial chapter in their dispute for control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company seems unwilling to cede its disputed to be present in the governing bodies of the Juniper.
Of its Board of Directors was descabalgado by five of his seven sons who were appointed administrators of the Assembly of shareholders of 18 January of this year and whose challenge is annotated in the commercial register.
The Board judicial of the Juniper for next day 16, convened by the judge of the commercial number 2 of Madrid, has again opened the box of Thunder in the family Alvarez.
Recourse to the judge to set the Assembly is, until that is resolved the conflict, the only legal mechanism to ensure the convening of the Board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo and Emilio, Marta Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Alvarez as a "desperate appeal of applicants their five children for using procedural trickery, clear law fraud and abuse of right"," try to validate and clean up the radically non-existent Board from January 18," according to its official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis so that, once held the Board, appropriate to challenge considering that it is "null void."
The same characters, who maintain a discreet silence, because they tried without success to judge convened in June, a Board.
In the Juniper, patrimonial and titular society of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the Group of services calls for the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to the family protocols.
This is the issue of substance which the judge must decide once held the view on the demand of challenge, for which there is still no date indicated.
Red Bull WINS in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software design improvements in cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of formula one in 2004, its history in this exclusive world of speed has been marked by the surprise and success.
At first nobody took into account the options of a newly arrived team and, despite the upward trajectory of recent seasons, last November, in the final stage of the Championship all bet on the success of the Ferrari's Fernando Alonso.
Without diminishing the ability as a pilot of the finally champion, German Sebastian Vettel, nor the capacity of the engine Renault which propels your car in the world of formula one has become a legend "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has placed in the hands of Red Bull to become a team winner.
He is actually a powerful simulation software processes that the German put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from the top car competition.
Known as PLM, this powerful software tool has been used to design factories manufacturing assembly lines in the world, power plants, high precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce, simulate faithful way the product or process prior to build real mode, thus avoiding errors and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of cameras from Canon, the aircraft of Sukhoi or most famous utilitarian cars from Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this software tool in its factory of formula 1 has helped Red Bull designed and carried out "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changeschanges and improvements that are detected during races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on his team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in vehicles during each season.
180 Young professionals from highly qualified, equipped with powerful computers today work in the Red Bull team, analyze and plan all sorts of modifications in the Roadsters.
The steering of Siemens explained that PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of the Red Bull Roadsters with the exception of the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
Amending the materials, fuel, aerodynamics and the security features.
Changes may be the virtual reality of the Simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to autoclaves of high-tech and advanced production laser systems.
As the only limitation of this madness of the technological improvement is the figure of $ 40 million to each F1 team can spend maximum on each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has mounted a high-tech factory to design and produce their Roadsters in a town about 50 kilometres from London.
It's two buildings which are restricted visits, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered to be "top secret."
The template for this purpose amounts to 580 people, including two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Red Bull F1, is undoubtedly the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources brand energy drinks has put at the service of their participation in the circuits, hide other actors whose contest is invaluable and their zero notoriety.
The head of technology of the factory, Steve Nevey, States that five years ago we could say that advances in research and development in carts cars providing 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology adds 85% success, while pilots provide 15% of added value.
Nevey recognizes that the Vettel or Webber never will be replaced by the computer "are unpredictable Gladiators."

Bet Sabadell for 'stealing' one million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directors, the Managing Director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the banking, but initially ruled out a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the war of the liabilities.
However, it provides for a collapse in the margins of interests, that it will try to offset in part by increases in fees and the price of credit.
Sabadell expected capture three years one million private customers, their unfinished business.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus survival in a difficult economic environment.
The Bank will launch in 2011 a new master plan that will have a validity of three years.
The aim, in addition to survive without having to resort to state aid of the FROB, is to gain market share with the recruitment of a new private customers - 700,000 million was deducted which can leave the Bank - the great unfinished business, that until now had more pampered to SMEs and companies that the retail customer.
This year has attracted 250,000 individual clients and 50,000 companies.
Their share of the market in particular is 3.5%, while in companies exceeds 10%.
One of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is an emphasis on productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with cost reduction as a goal, and whose challenges them will expose the Bank when you present the results of the exercise.
Few banks are afraid in these times to establish goals and make them public as the financial crisis has altered all the plans of the banking world.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its master plan Optima, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the market situation made that an exercise will expand it.
Clients that let slip away savings will be its main objective.
In a breakfast organised by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a year "difficult and far-reaching."
The Executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
In addition, in two or three years will be "very difficult to create employment," something fundamental to the survival of the banking business, insisted.
And, although it believed that the war of liabilities - which penalized margins - is being reduced, the price of risk premiums that are paying banks and by their emissions to obtain liquidity are moving already at the cost of the credit to offset the fall in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and funding is structural, and will be a factor of pressure on the credit."
"We have not closed the tap, but spreads are higher," he acknowledged Guardiola.
Banesto already gave the Thursday orders to your network so that the credit limit in the long term and raise the price of the differential - see ONDAS on 22 and 27 November.
It also recognized that the trend of banking "is now up commissions," but "there is a competitive framework."
The master plan for Sabadell is based on organic growth, although, as always, the Group did not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says that in Spain "they are here to require larger sizes."
"Next year is to move everything," he said.
Asserts that the capital requirements are "uploaded a lot" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial entity enter into red numbers.
And he points out that the FROB can supply to the market uptake of funds before new recapitalizations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive to the temporary closure of markets, it glossed over what some bankers predict already as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot issue, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repos, which dampens the crisis.
The ECSC ruled out a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The director-general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled yesterday that it will be a wave of mergers of savings banks and returned to insist on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being implemented.
When it started the process of concentration of Spanish savings banks, were several institutions which ensured that they would not participate in this first phase, and that they reservarían for the second round.
However, the director-general of the Confederation Spanish boxes for savings (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday dismissed that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I think that it has become the largest part of the merger, the incorporation of Cajasol civic banking group cannot be said to be a second round, so there are adjustments."
"The majority is completely made;" "can we go to 13 or 14 instead of 17 but all major processes have already made and protected by the Bank of Spain, that this has worked a lot also," noted the steering.
Speaking at a breakfast of the Association of managers and executives of Aragon (ADEA), Lezo has exposed the concentration process is undertaken "to the maximum possible speed, and we must be very satisfied of as it is occurring in deadlines than in his day"," not now, have been set in the plans of business with the Bank of Spain," emphasized.
"Moving from 45 boxes with an average of 28,500 million in volume of assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a process that is unmatched in history, reducing the number of entities in a 62% to make them much larger to meet Basel"He stressed.
Lezo acknowledged that "there are a number of views very fortunate about the slowness of the process" showing "a lack of seriousness and sense," because "what is the Bank of Spain is remember that we have to be within the time limit before the end of the year."
The director-general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system across Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who put him into question a "lack of knowledge."
The Director pointed out that, in the current economic situation, "we can be very quiet" with the situation of financial institutions, savings banks, a system that has embarked on a process of concentration "very important" and which "goes to the highest possible speed."
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector came out very well stop of the stress tests conducted by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German Red line
Berlin has opted to hold on to the euro, but has established conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets have led to a double Government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment, from tax cuts to SME measures, regulation of private agencies of placement or removal of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed without delivery, until the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of the airport of Barajas and El Prat and 30 per cent of state lotteries.
On the other hand, the Vice-Chairperson Elena Salgado, with the support of the ex-President Felipe Gonzalez, has joined criticism to Chancellor Angela Merkel for his responsibility in initiating the current crisis.
How should we interpret these movements?
It goes without saying that the position of Merkel is not an error in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another round of measures in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And there Germany has a radical new vision of what should be its future, which collides with the keep the ancient traditions of much of its partners.
Against the European resistance, in Germany begins to speculate on the possible three exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, consisting of herself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, while the South left the monetary area.
The second, the recovery of the framework, it may now seem science fiction, with a stream of very favourable opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macro-economic control, budgetary rigour, fines for transgressors countries, possible suspension of payment of any of them and spread to the private sector of the potential adjustment costs.
The German position is clear and is defining for some time, so now there could be no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission encouraged the deficits, the German Government was pulled out of the sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed that it should be (plans for fiscal rigour and stability in public finance), and what were its European partners, including France.
The second in the front gave the Central European country when Merkel dragged painfully rescue of Greece decision.
Already then it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the general public and published were very much against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, again Merkel emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the treaties of the Union, to make possible the rescue of a country and, at the same time, forcing the private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, that it helped precipitate the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat purée, has been adopted and, in the coming months, we should assist the process of reform of the Union which enables those measures starting in 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not think cross.
And it is telling us all that, although it now has to take steps which perhaps isn't very agreement, from the date the former operation of the euro, it will be over.
The 2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the offending countries will be severely punished, may be forced to declare bankruptcy and, in this case, the private sector shall also bear part of the cost.
Germany is pointing us that we must follow a severe growth path with high rates of savings and investment, restraint in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as which has chaired the Spanish growth in the boom years, simply not will tolerate.
The challenge is clear.
And we would do wrong in not to understand this.
It is not only bringing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we require is much harder.
And worst thing we could do in these circumstances is to mislead ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will no longer step to greater peace of mind.
And that we seize the window of opportunity they have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that the Zapatero President has also understood well and his double Manifesto (reforms promised after the meeting on Saturday with big business and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticisms of Merkelpath has opened the thesis that we should put House in order.
But the red line has been drawn there by Germany is, and does not seem that they are going to move.
And, between the possibilities provided for, the leave a too crowded little serious countries currency zone, it cannot be excluded.
Then, Germany always can tell US that we had already warned.
Sport and law fraud
Wiles as Alonso and Ramos to Ajax show wit but will not escape punishment.
The expulsion allegedly hatched by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game played on November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink that they are written about whether or not such behavior is unsportsmanlike and ifeventually both players should be punished by UEFA.
As it is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (that his team had already clearly won), the two players lost deliberately time out faults paths to provoke the referee to show them the second yellow card.
That way, and because already Real Madrid will end up as leader of his group, both players will meet the regulatory sanction the next match of the League against the French, and they may pass clean cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned with two matches to the coach, José Mourinho, and various economic quantities involved players.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not new, but rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of the unwritten, but followed, sport's rules.
Part of the discussion emerged in the case told is because that has been led by a team of the institution of Real Madrid (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and in past times has fined its players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramaApparently, by Mourinho, who adds an episode to its long history of technical histrionic and provocative.
In any case, the discussion revolves around whether such behaviour not expressly prohibited by the rules of procedure contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. If these actions are committed fraud in law; in fact, they are environmentally friendly actions with the sporting regulations, but they seem to escape its meaning.
The question is look at the kind of damage they cause to the spirit of sport.
One of the assets comprising the sportsmanship is the physical integrity of the opponents, aspect that these actions do not endanger, i.e. There was no violent game.
Another of these goods which is alluded to with fair play is to avoid offending players team to take advantage in an unfair manner on the opposing team, something that also occurred.
However, the paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it is not accommodated to what are usually known as trap or fraud law, because its violation of the rules was not hidden to try to avoid the sanction, but that precisely its action sought to be the more obvious to receive the punishment of the referee.
They expected and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is what kind of advantage obtained the offenders in the examined intentional fouls.
Here it seems necessary to verify that is not placed at a disadvantage to the rival or obtained benefit in the same game, because obviously the result of the action is to leave the team with fewer players.
And it is also useful for the next game strategy, because the club can not count these players.
The advantage is obviously that the players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten its participation in a future party.
But it's an advantage in the long term, with a certain degree of uncertainty, since the team may be eliminated in the first round, and in addition to this performance players met a party of sanction and passed to the second round of cards, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
In such a way that, in going through rounds, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not against the spirit of sportsmanship, of which it forms part make strategic decisions that favor take full advantage of allowing the rules.
In the case before us, the players did not act to evade the application of sanctions (this would be a clear case of fraud of law), but who rather chose when to undergo it.
They took a strategic decision not circumvent the punishment or flee from it.
Although the border between wit and fraud law is fuzzy, on this occasion, I think that he was a clear case of wit.
The controversy, I think, arises from two factors: because dealt with two autoexpulsiones and by the way in which the transmission of the guideline of provoking them was carried out.
The damage caused to the principles of the sport by these actions is not both ethical and aesthetic.
Offers offensive to capture the Christmas dinners for groups in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the timetable concentrated this year an avalanche of reserves for 16 and 17 days.
There are many celebrations autosufragadas by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As the nougat and lottery, with the arrival of December also return group dinner prior to Christmas, still acting as a lifeline for the restoration and recreation of Barcelona, but that because of the crisis have resulted in a price offensive adjusted in order to capture the majority client: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or lunches, match employers and industry associations interviewed.
To complicate the accounting, the calendar of this year (to fall new year's Eve on Friday) has concentrated requests during the week of December 13, with the result so far of an avalanche of reservations of dinners for days tip (16 and 17) and just move to the previous week.
As it has been already happening since 2008, when he began the phase of lean, there are many companies that have eliminated the collective meals by budgetary issue.
To not dispense with the tradition, many workers hold it paying out-of-pocket.
Whatever the situation, others require prices of battle, confirms the President of the Gremi of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs Restauració.
The representative of the employer, to this day, does not dare to predict how will be the celebration of this month.
"The people you think much before booking."
"Want to go but have alerts on at the issue of prices," he notes.
The business shall be well "who provide quality at a good price and good service," adds, and recalls that customers tend to lose a step with the crisis, so that the strip around 25 euros has become majority in demand.
In a survey in various downtown establishments are found the collapse of petitions for the night of 17.
In the Group Soteras indicate that there is a real boom of requests for that Friday, with the aim of spending less than 30 euros, which have responded by adapting their menus at the juncture with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the more powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 outlets in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more advance booking, even since the beginning of November.
"Have done the impossible to keep the same prices of last year, with menus to suit all tastes from 19,95 up 30 euros," are listed.
AN Grup, that flag El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locations, they remain optimistic after detecting a rise in Billings since the second half and some good, although concentrated, prospects for business for Christmas.
Sources of the Group include the 18 will also be a day hyperactive at the level of groups of friends who precelebran the holidays.
Its six group menus have been added one Christmas, with 30 euros or more as budget star and the perception that there is willingness to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green shoots in some companies returning to invite employees and feel that the volume of the groups is something more.
By the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of bars, restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona), his Vice President, Enric Gomà, trusts begin to see the end of the tunnel and argues that the reservations are "animated" as a whole, although customers "negotiated the most."
That Yes, the illusion for the celebrations has not fallen, pay who pays, according to.
The Pakistani nuclear program generated great concern in the U.S.
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons to "faster than any other country."
Leaks from Wikileaks confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. filtered by the Wikileaks website State Department confirms the enormous concerns causing the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
Apart from the illuminating and juicy details offered on the content of conversations and thoughts of American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that the cooperation between the two countries on nuclear safetyinstead of going on the rise, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that weapons are not assembled but remain stockpiled by components to hinder their destruction in case of attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
Thus enumerates it the Ambassador to Pakistan Anne w. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit by the then Minister of national security, James Jones: "the proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under attack Taliban, rumored dispersal of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials."
The large number of people involved in the nuclear stockpiles and missile programs is covered, not only for us, but also for Russia, as a proliferating and reason to keep the guard.
"Pakistan has had to recruit staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities;" "given the fall of the educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work on nuclear programs or missile, said the expert Yuri Korolev, Russian Foreign Ministry, in a meeting with their American counterparts.
The most novel of documentation leaked by Julian Assange portal is less and less cooperation between the United States and Pakistan on issues of nuclear proliferation and the large Pakistani pace of production of nuclear weapons.
An Office of the Embassy in may, which described as "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, says: "transparency is often non-existent;" "the offers of aid remain unanswered or are discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, officer of the national intelligence for South Asia, noted that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also calls on Washington, during a visit by the head of the army, general Ashfaq Kayani, to leave "very clear" to the charge that "The army of Pakistan must end with the tacit support to terrorist groups."
The hunt for the head of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a senior of the fight against terrorism to prevent new leaks.
Interpol issued a red alert in order to follow the movements and pinpoint Assange wherever you are.
Everything about Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Furthermore, is not new, they dated from November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the last filtration of more than a quarter of a million of us diplomatic documents but with accusations of sexual abuse which the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, says that "the police know where and how contact with Mr Assange."
It was the 20th when the international police body based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but not her revealed until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities of that country.
So things, 188 Interpol countries have indications of identify or locate Assange "with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol may not order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the Member States, as he has explained the Organization, do feel to be the so-called network notice free rein to carry out an arrest - who should undertake the national body of police-especially if you have a bilateral extradition agreement, as it is the case of Sweden and England, where it is believed that it is Assange.
The move has outraged Assange lawyers, that yesterday posted a letter claiming that the founder of Wikileaks, 39 years old, has been willing to respond via videoconference questions from the Swedish authorities.
Also remember that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden of the Prosecutor in his case, which compared to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Chief of security of Stalin.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution," the complaint letter.
While the world looks - and from Australia his mother defends innocence of her son - Assange continues in whereabouts unknown, but not silent.
On Monday he gave from an undetermined location an interview to the director of Time magazine on Skype, a conversation in which it requested the resignation of Secretary of State in the US, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering American diplomats that they moussad UN violating international treaties that USA has signed, should resign," said.
His opinion was denostada yesterday by the Press Secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described as "ridiculous and absurd" resignation request.
"Am not quite sure why we should import the view of a guy with a webpage," he told the CNN network.
The own Obama has commissioned a senior of the fight against terrorism, Russell Travers, to prevent new leaks of documents.
The attempt of the spokesman for the President Barack Obama downplay Assange contrasted with opinions that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, Congressman from January will chair the Committee on national security in the lower House, has asked the State Department to study the possibility of involving Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organisations "to intervene and its funds and pursue to any to them of any contribution or help."
Further still has been Tom Flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to back down after saying that Assange should "be killed."
"Obama should become objective, and using an unmanned aircraft or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist, exgobernador Minister of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in Government who leaked information is guilty of treason and anything other than the implementation would be too gentle punishment," said on Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with winks to the allied to Carod
The leading Republican Party will enable a secret ballot on his continued.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the Assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to circumvent the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without North by the loss of 11 members and half of the votes.
The President of the party is aware that its hint of resignation is insufficient for the related to the exlíder Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but also knows that the influence of this sector is today so diluted as his own mentor, and that in no way can cause the headaches he had with other extinct flows.
For this reason, the leader of Esquerra will attempt to win over the new critics with winks to harden until municipal elections.
For starters, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national directors of ERC may rule on its continuity in secret.
By means of ballot papers, and not hand alzada.
If the carodistas want to vehicular certain punishment vote to the President, they may do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader wants to avoid the image of Division as the subjugation to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that it would not be ratified with the half plus one the votes, but he added, without specifying percentages, that a result would not be good "to the Bulgarian."
The next to Carod require the President something more to put his charge at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is worthless when Puigcercós controls the highest body between congresses.
But in the absence of sufficient majority to force resignations, will try to agree with the Executive a sheet of route between now and may.
To do this, they expect to participate in the preparation of the document of strategic reorientation that management put to the vote of the National Council on day 18.
His intention is to endorse Puigcercós to change that this promises to bring forward the Congress in fall of 2011, something that the dome is already taken for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that "polyphony" is detrimental to stability and that their goal is to make that, once and for all, the Organization will be able to wash the dirt of gates towards inside.
In this line, it is symptomatic the article that the Counsellor Josep Huguet Office signed on his blog.
Considered to be the ideologue of Puigcercós, the owner of innovation gave by fact that the leader will be endorsed "for various objectives."
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first, "fixing" the Executive so that it represents at least 90% of the membership, i.e., to include new faces coming to Carod sector.
The second can be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidated once the asambleísmo as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a revision of the statutes allowing hold congresses by delegates elected by vote.
End the Assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the team of Puigcercós, which already battled in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 left the order to the address of reviewing the asambleísmo at a specific Congress of statutes.
This event is still pending, because the internal tide of recent years disdained to deal with the matter.
Now, without critical sectors lurking, it may be a good time to return to it and try to close it forever.

He maintains China objectives of reducing greenhouse gas
The representative of that country in the COP16 said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and explained that it maintains its offer to reduce its emission of greenhouse gases by 2020 between 40 and 45 per cent.
China maintains its offer of between 40 and 45 percent reduce their emissions of GHG by 2020, said Su Wei, representative of that country in the COP16.
In his first public appearance in the 16th Conference of the parties of the of the United Nations Framework Convention on climate change (COP16), Su Wei said his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and restructure its industry.
In fact, he exhibited, in the last four years his country has invested US $ 245 million in efforts to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work jointly with the international community in that area.
He noted that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four categories: dialogue; capacity building; construction of institutions and support for pilot programs.
All these items have been progress, including the adoption, last year, a new energy law, which includes the objectives set out in reduction of gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, stressed that in China, the federal authorities have been working in coordination with the State and local, to achieve the goals of energy saving, use of energy efficiency and reduced emissions.
In addition, it abounded, they are under way or already completed various multi-annual plans, both funded by the Chinese, by Governments of other countries.

Attached to legality expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The PAN national leader explained that the former ruling pan has the right to go to the Commission of national order to claim that its law suits.
The national leader of the PAN, Cesar Nava Vazquez, said that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to the legality and that the former ruling pan has the right to go to the Commission of national order to claim that its law suits.
In interview prior to the taking of protest of Gabino cue Monteagudo as Governor of the State, said that, in any case, the expulsion of Hawthorn is a decision taken at the local level.
"It's an autonomous decision of the Commission of Sonora order."
"Mr Hawthorn has his right of recourse, where appropriate, via the claim to the Commission of the order of the National Council, so that is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," he scored.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think in 2012 and that an Alliance for the presidential candidacy was never at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that national action will emerge strengthened from the internal election of the next 4 and 5 December, in which will have to elect his successor.
"This (an Alliance in 2012) is a theme that was never on the negotiating table, at least not for now, was an approach to the local election was successful and fulfilled the objective," spoke.

He said that no doubt the Council will know to choose the best or the best leader that requires national action for the next three years, that is why it will deliver the estafeta "whom the Council determine."
"I have this absolute tranquility and openness, to any of the five would be proud to give the Office of the President of the party."

At the interrogation on the criticisms of the PRI President Felipe Calderon on his speech in the context of the four years of his Government, Cesar Nava called the PRI-ISTAS to reflect on the six former Presidents Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Ernesto Zedillo.
"If the PRI believes that the Governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón;" that it will begin to defend; "coming out of the closet," he said.
It was of the view that the holder of the federal executive can do expressions like those made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because there are gag or much less censorship in the country.
Promotes Obama in Twitter Act for undocumented students
"If you because that pass the Dream Act is appropriate, calls to your Senators and urge them to adopt is legislation," tweeteó the U.S. in the popular social network President.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you because that pass the Dream Act is appropriate, calls to your Senators and urge them to adopt is legislation," tweeteó Obama.
Your brief message kept open a cybernetic link to a broader document asking the public to communicate immediately with the senators, given that the vote of the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote is expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," points out.
The message was disclosed after that the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless it is approved the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts and funding from the Government.
This blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects as the ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs relied on that once resolved the fiscal issue, it may set a timetable for the rest of the projects.
"I think that there is much time..."
"All agree that we have to resolve the tax matter before year's end..."
"I think that we can be reached at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that would call a "vote of closure of debate" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, although more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or law of the American dream legalize to about 800 thousand youths who joined United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country five years and were admitted to an institution of higher education or the army.
But supporters needed 60 votes to pass the initiative, which require the assistance of a handful of Republicans, now that party of the project organizations star an intense lobbying to ensure the adoption of the law.
Democrats, most of which supports the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only a Republican has expressed its support for the law, Richard place of Indiana.
For this reason, proponents of the Dream Act require several Republicans to join in the event that other Democrats decide to turn our backs on the initiative.
Among the most cortejados Republicans are the senators from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, of Texas, but have stated that they will not her support on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported John McCain, has not defined its position at this time.
Although the House has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces major obstacles in the Senate.
With literature put the finger in the wound
The second round of the delights of the language was a walk where participants made gala of the narration
"That sex in the language understand you but... the finger in the wound?" What is expected of me? ," questioning the author Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of the delights of the language, cycle that celebrates the Spanish literature and this time used the subtitle of your question (at another show the round table was devoted to sex in the language) " (, explained).
The finger in the wound... "puts us in trouble," sweetly snapped the Argentine writer to the public, mostly of young people, that occurred appointment at the international fair of the book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this Panel discussion moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended by Valenzuela, Sergio RamírezMayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read out a text which he dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and Shultz would later define as a great story, with Louise in first person as the protagonist that seeking to know what the "nail," is medical doctorthat you don't get responses even though Yes tracks in the same narrative thread.
The infectologist leaves convinced: "patience is not my forte, perhaps be my wound."
In the end, after a frustrated rapprochement with the traumatologist who have been cheated out of breath in the middle of the aisle, but whom he clarifies that wound is not a scientific term; It is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "of the wound only could know what the real open and there," but convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls of language must be highly interspersed.
Valenzuela, writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a deleitosa narrative that titled in praise of the invention, where the finger in the wound is not named but at a time when it is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, it has a famous sorceress, that same played clouds, brought back to men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that had lost a maiden, narration tacked to later talk Americathe great novel that not lacked from the beginning their own reporters who had and he cited Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticises the excesses of cash by the Pathfinders captains.
"Cervantes who invented us all (writers) made mockery of the rubber-stamp Sham witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise never would have come to tell the story of America with imagination that was missing to indecent assault."
However, he stressed "they are fools and tricksters who better imagine" and it is where converges reality and lying, which already is not known to belong to one side or the other, where fiction reached its peak of the narrative.

Roman is going for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three losses in finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has been able to achieve decisive series already three times.
The duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three losses in finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has been able to achieve decisive series, already three times but so far it has gone blank and is for that reason that this time is very special to him.
The Argentine it has ended consoling with the runner-up Medal, it has been a step back from the winners and curiously with a team he has played consecutive finals.
Santista strategist reached her first final as a coach in the 2002 Apertura tournament, when he took the reins of the Morelia with which fell by 4-2 aggregate to Toluca; later, in the 2003 closing also reached the decisive duel and also lost it 3-1 overall and was precisely to stripes.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 bicentennial tournament, again against the Devils, Rubén returned to suffer a setback, his team finished tied 2-2 before the ñora pepper after 210 minutes of play, but in the wave of pénaltis was put into advantage by 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three players his own failed since the 11 steps and suffered the flip 4-3.
Rubén already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in shift, so it does not want to suffer the same fate, it seeks to remove the spell and to celebrate for the first time a title, while stating that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to go out a champion, do not want to break any statistics, this is for a club, a penchant to which I owe me and consequently the title will come to me, but this is the most important," commented the helmsman when is it questioned about the numbers that you have against playing end.
Very current has the previous final, of which, says, he has learned a lot, "the only education that we have is that until the referee whistle the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared in a row, players also, because last time"," with two criminal to throw we were already prepared for running out and I think that is a lesson, until the end not the party can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could define criminal shooting, something which is not concerned, because trusts his players: "you never want to reach the penalties, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and must be prepared"," we were prepared in the previous tournament, unfortunately made us a bad move destination, sometimes by nerves or anxiety of having the title in the hands, but we went, that left us something for this final which hopefully does not reach that instance."
Roman has in its hands to stop being a technical runner up and try for the first time the glory that give the titles.

NASA announced discovery of extraterrestrial life
The American space agency cited the press to present tomorrow a finding that will cause impact in the search for living in space.
The National Aeronautics and space (NASA) of United States will be released tomorrow, Thursday, a discovery Astrobiology, who could prove the theory that yes there is extraterrestrial life.
The finding will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 13: 00 hours at the headquarters of the NASA in Washington by experts in Astrobiology, science described as responsible for studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
To quote the press, NASA said it would submit "a finding that will cause impact in the search for extraterrestrial life," which gave rise to speculations of experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures while our and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility that they will become intelligent beings such as humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
Apparently it's a Microbe which was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in the Park national Yosemite, California, where he lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, the Lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive, and this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, who do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms used arsenic in their metabolism, shall be demonstrated that there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from what we know."
The space agency will release the full extent of the findings in the morning press conference Thursday.
At the Conference he will participate the geobióloga Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (Saturn's largest moon), the perspective that their chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
This gesta PRD, PT and convergence pattern opposition ' block'
With reforms to the organic law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartisanship', they denounce.

With this reform, reiterated, it kicks off 'bipartisanship', because they will now be two people of equal number of games, which will control Congress.
These four members, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, Coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by the Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, Pan in his capacity as Vice President.
Corvera Quevedo, explained that with these reforms in institutional way constitutes the political part of the PRI and PAN marginality.
He explained that in the next few days they speak with representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the schema, on the basis of a political will, and if they do not, then they will be subjugated again by both parties and thereby ended the opposition coalition.
"So far came (opposition coalition), is what I look at, because we are excluded, any decision, nor siquieran have the courtesy policy consider the opinion of the rest."
Philip Manzanarez Rodríguez, of convergence, mentioned that there are matches with the PRD, PT and pattern, and that is why they are shaping a diverse group.
It cannot afford, continued, that the Congress after it was monopoly, is now "duopólico."
"Is not the spirit to the reform of the law to be an eternal bipatidismo in Congress."
For starters, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are conversing with other colleagues to make them more, added the convergent.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that currently the Congress became a 'bounty' between two, in allusion to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was only a game, now you are dividing it between two."
Pattern Montalvo, called for respect for the personality of the Member, be given their place at the negotiating table.
"Not by agreements namely, was let out to 5 that probably we will make 9 right now members of the five to see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unify us to look for a place at the negotiating table""that is the issue that we're out in the reform that they did that they agreed, and we do not agree that reform."

He said that the poor condition of the streets and the sidewalks has affected because tourists come to walk and see the mess and get you back to the nearby business.
"Politicians do not know what it is to close one day a company and have no idea of the fortune that is lost, or otherwise not made in this way works in so long and without proper planning."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez hotelier said that the fall of the tourist described the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume their responsibility and avoid that it happens again, how to do this because taking preventive maintenance and not fall only on the corrective," he said.
"We are keen to enjoy a clean city, because not only to be tourist area should be keeping, but as people who deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep well to the city."
There are other sites that also look sloppy and incomplete, said, like the shield and the Venadito of Mazatlán.
"Today, so come the tourist does not only depend on the promotion, there should be a good product, a city that takes cleaning their beaches, its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions," he said.
"Due attention has not been given and this kind of facts shows something that is well known by all, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martinez, Assistant Secretary of tourism, said that it is urgent to the rescue of Mazatlan tourist sites, because they are not exploited properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places to be put online in conjunction with the municipality and priority to be to take the city on the day, clean, orderly and attractive because it is tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlan offers many sites and historical and cultural sites to be ordered first, clean up and get in line to make them attractive to be able add the inventory we have to promote the destination."
He requests Congressional IP results
Eduardo Davalos, President of the CCE, proposed that the members assume the great responsibility of being an example of view for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges facing.
A legislature of decent and free agreements between parties and the State executive work calls for business of Mazatlán, because there is a troubled Sinaloa facing major problems.
The 60 legislature, consisting of seven political forces, was installed yesterday from 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the bread, three of the new Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of convergence and one of the PVEM, which added a total of 40 representatives of the people.

Eduardo Davalos Zamora, President of the business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly released 40 deputies of the Congress of the State to assume the great responsibility of being an example of view for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges facing.
"We hope that the members actually exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to ensure the interests and become comparsas carnavaleras rulers and leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
That is why he spoke of it to certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges which take forward the ruler in question time.
"We take care to come to make a decent and above all committed to society and sectors work because it was the sinaloenses who gave them the vote of confidence in the last election."

As for tourism, he demanded that new lawmakers give the weight of in the State budget to strengthen the State Secretary of tourism.

Looking for a magician King
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are yearning for the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For parents, the next day of Kings will be difficult to please their illusions, because your home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar give away them toys and clothes they both want.
The family lives a humble House in the colony Salvador Allende and live a day because the father has no regular employment.
"Because sometimes we we see hard because my husband has no chamba, but sell Tangerine and Pope... already in the afternoon go with the 'plebes' to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the children.
Adelaide, of 4 years, want a doll or a bicycle, while his sister Isabel, 3 years, would like a Barbie doll.
For its part, José Alfredo, aged 10, aims for a time to have a 'monster' car and for her little brother Jesus, for 8 months of age, Cayetana suggests clothing size for a year.
"Told me (José Alfredo), 'I have this monster', but I said 'Let's see son', because it was very expensive," recalled with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, who were in school, clothing and footwear would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaiah, in 10 years, is size 10, while Miguel, 8 years, uses size eight.
José Juan, aged 14, is missing about tennis, so a pair of size five and a half or six it would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family can participate in the campaign wanted a magician King, by donating a toy or cash at the reception of Northwest.
Fourteen suspects detained drug traffickers
On Wednesday, in Estrie, it has been a dozen of persecution in the context of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of Cannabis.
Fourteen people who will be facing various allegations have been arrested.
The persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places where there was production of the drug.
"Have seized about 750 Cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for the production," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the security of Québec.
In total, have been arrested 11 men and three women, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men of Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at the courthouse of Sherbrooke in the hours after his arrest.
They could face charges of production of Cannabis, possession with a view to trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have been produced after a long investigation that has lasted nearly a year.
"Has been the information provided by the public which has allowed us to make the arrests," States Mr Ruel.
This police operation involved about seventy actors of the research module of Estrie in the security of Quebec, of the Sherbrooke and the Memphrémagog Police Department police service.
You can fight against clandestine migration without problems
Conservatives Bill which, according to the Government should solve the problem of the small boats loaded with illegal migrants, probably will face great opposition, given that the three opposition parties announced Wednesday that could not support it.
"Me I based mainly on the letter."
"I am here with a party that has created the granite you pisáis," said the liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by the members after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals argue that the Bill in its current form, which would make it possible to detain any person who comes from a ship identified as transport of illegal immigrants, up to one year violate the Canadian Charter of rights and freedoms.
The leader of the bloc of Quebec, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that I could not support the draft law because it points to the wrong target.
"We are against and, apparently, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we'll see what the Government is doing," said Mr Duceppe.
The critique of the NPD in the field of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected a stroke of the criticisms which point out that his party is not sufficiently firm with illegal immigrants.
"The neodemócratas are in agreement that action be taken against those responsible for the people of clandestine and that is what we are with another draft law, the C-35," says Mrs Chow.
"Do not support the draft law of the Conservatives because attacking refugees and arresting children for at least a year," explains Mrs Chow.
The immigration Minister Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of the position of play to politicians and to ignore the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians said the members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a doormat."
"Expect that Canada take strong measures," believes the Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on his Bill, which could lead the country into an election as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has informed the Agency QMI that the Government was seeking a vote so that every Member to oppose then explain to their constituents.
The new drive does not get unanimity
While it was announced the possible establishment of a permanent unit in the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers are still calling for the establishment of a Commission's public consultation on the issue.
The Minister of public security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation in New York has been issue since January of last year.
The metropolis has a permanent drive against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, the announcement on Tuesday has been caught by surprise more than one.
It must be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on the enforcement of Quebec held the past 29 October, never discussed this measure despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the critic of the party Quebec dealing with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, uprecedented this announcement as "a rabbit out of the top hat" and as "a sloppy solution of last-minute."
The Minister Dutil, for its part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unit.
"Will see the results when we publicize," it simply indicates.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public inquiry.
"Longer is persistently Mr Charest to avoid the creation of this Committee of inquiry, more people share our view, that is to say, has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way of having a Committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, Professor of ethics and governance of the national school of public administration.
To break this deadlock, suggested to Quebec to grant a special mandate to the auditor general to carry out a survey on collusion and corruption.
"Must be able to extend the mandate of the auditor general," he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could give to the financial controller the same powers that a Commissioner, allowing it to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent crew is not the only project in the making in the Charest government.
Quebec also asks Ottawa to amend the criminal code so that it suits better this type of crime.
This request appears to come from the Prosecutor of the Marteau operation, which has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that case law is not explicit in this type of research.
The federal Minister of public safety, Vic Toews, confirmed meanwhile that his counterpart of Justice, Rob Nicholson, was now inclined to make certain amendments on this subject.
During the operation spring 2001 related groups of bikers, although not the penal code had been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Later, Ottawa prompted the adoption of the law on the gangsterism.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Various courses of water are being closely monitored because of heavy precipitation that have occurred in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday evening there was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
At night, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.

From Tuesday to Wednesday night, various regions recorded a heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimetres of rain.
They also expect between 20 and 40 mm additional from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors located to the North of the river and the Valley of the Outaouais were affected most.
They could receive up to a total of 100 mm of rain.
Given that these precipitations are added to the melting of the snow that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that many rivers overflowing.
On Wednesday night, the unity of civil security of Quebec issued alerts for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused flooding in the past and are under surveillance.
In the region of Lanaudière, the heavy rainfall have caused is desbordasen some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline--Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have dragged a provisional bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten homes have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, notably in the town of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The civil security unit remains on alert and was monitoring the situation closely, as it has been indicated Annik Bouchard, Minister of security.

They partly blame Dupont
Stéphane Dupont Quebec radio host has suffered a true setback to the Canadian Council standards of broadcasting (CCNR) by a few controversial statements on social assistance and on Haitians, as well as by his rude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, an unduly negative representation of Haitians and uncouth language that should not be used in emissions reported during the day."
The Council has also indicated that discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the name of two people who had committed suicide, do not infringe on the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints in relation to the comments made in emission spread between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued after a complaint from the common front of recipients of social assistance of Quebec.
The Group complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were not correct.
The presenters must provide reliable data and not leading to deception.
In connection with the suicide, the presented Stéphane Dupont stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
The majority of the members of the Committee have come to the conclusion that the message conveyed was that it should not be seen suicide as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considered that the episodes in question of" Dupont le midi "have dealt with a sensitive issue in a fair and proper manner."
Therefore in this regard any fault has been scrapped.
The latest dispute referred to the statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had starred in a clash media which had given rise to many reactions.
The presenter of CHOI stated that it had not performed any donation to help the Haitians because he could not know for sure if the need were to actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect is an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"Already I have served my suspension of three days there up."
"My record is clean for a year and a half," said the presenter.
In all decisions, the Committee denounced the issuance of uncouth language.
In any case, the chain of CHOI-FM radio has worked "even more than what is required."
The consequences will be minimal for the station, which shall, inter alia, announce decisions once in the hours of greatest audience within a period of three days.
A King of kung-fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had a very peculiar way.
The athlete, that stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and and thai box, climbs to the tatami mats and rings in the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial as the kickboxing and kung-fu 12 years ago, in Algeria," said Zemmal, who lives in the metropolis since 2008 to advance the professional level.
"In my case, I look for fighting everywhere because, for those who do not enjoy the game on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security officer and employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals in the amateur world championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) which was held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the categories of full contact kickboxing and thai box," he explained.
"Now I prepare to participate in the World Cup of san shou in China."
"They will invite to athletes who have finished among the top four in the last championship of the world in every category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Viet Nam, I ended up in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I have been making progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I will be the first this time or next year!"
"Sanda" or the "san shou" is originally from China which allows hitting with fists and feet, as well as launch the opponents to the ground.
The clashes are originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The Boxer most famous in this type of match is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although birth Zemmal only must maintain a competition in his career, he certainly will attend the Grand tournament "King of Sanda," the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most well-known and prestigious of China," explains the nice boy.
"It's like the equivalent of the (the largest stadium in Thailand) Lumpinee Stadium."
"It has been an incredible experience."
Zemmal has won his first match, in his category (80 kg) semi-finals, but lost in the final.
"That I have won is a true professional," he believes.
"There are four competitors in each category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg) ."
"The winners of the semifinals faced at the end of its category."
"Then, the winners of each category face to Crown a single champion, the King of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has granted direct contracts with a value of $ 450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the center of this avalanche of over one hundred contracts is a consortium formed by companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has been without a prior notice the most important contract, of project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The Consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following the decision of Hydro-Québec to entrust to the private sector its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric of $ 5 billion project.
In early 2005, the Consortium Énergie gérance won the lucrative contract without competitive bidding should be previously conducted.
For the party Québec, recourse to consortia of companies poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate the competition and lead to a rise in prices.
"It's a new method of collusion and eliminating the competition."
"That is to say, the people, rather than in secret, they now do so openly," said yesterday the Deputy of the party Québec Sylvain Simard in a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, said he does not understand how can benefit the public interest in this way.
The Minister of natural resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, strongly denying that there has been collusion with this contract.
"I begin to tire me," protested, arguing that the PQ had acted as "dishonest" and "lack of rigor."
He noted that "the minimum" would be that the PQ is disculpase.
The formula of consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, it's an alliance with a time limit that allows two or several companies pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the scale of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been granted unless he came into game competition; It has sought negotiations.
In addition, the formula of consortia is no longer the exception to the rule in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As he published Le Devoir last week, the formula of the consortiums in the area of technical advice is being subjected to an investigation into the Government.
A quick look at the mercantile registry of Quebec can identify more than 200 corporations, of which some seem to be permanent.
In this way, the company Dessau works in partnership with most of its major competitors, such as CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leading to a single legal entity, i.e., Dessau.
In regards to the Consortium Énergie gérance, Normandeau Minister has stressed that "the territory of James Bay responds to a particular labour dynamics and Hydro-Québec responds specifically to it since the 1970s."
The major Eastmain, Réal Laporte, project manager of the Société d'énergie de Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation which has highlighted the fact that project management contract has been granted in a direct way.
"If you respond to a tender and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the actors of the sector and tell them: we will negotiate an agreement with a good price and satisfactory."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competence of the people," said Mr Laporte.
The contract awarded to the Consortium Énergie gérance is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 dollars obtained by the party Québec.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec and SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After checking, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, including geotechnical laboratory.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar got 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, regardless of their participation in Énergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, amount to $449.783.344, including the contract of Énergie gérance of 295.131.564 dollars.
Sylvain Simard has been given to understand that the four companies that form the Consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good acquaintances of the liberal party of Quebec."
The Minister Normandeau has been dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, that "Finance," prior to clarify that this is more of their leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More eco-friendly, but deeply skeptical.
The consumer Québec just confident actors of sustainable development, as well as the brands of fair trade or organic certificates to guide their choices.
According to the barometer of responsible consumption, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is submerged in a universe media where swarm messages that advocate a more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that this even slows its commitment.
Even if it has increased the consumption of products called "socially responsible" in 2010, Quebecers seem to give little credence to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of environmental enterprises or in advertising them, in fact, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of the responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers casts doubt on the reliability of official certificates that carry fair called products, as well as the credibility of the products and brands that carry labels indicating that they are "ecorresponsables," points out the barometer.
In the same way, only 14.6% of Quebecers take seriously the speeches of politicians on this issue.
In any case, the information on the responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, now supported by nearly one-third of consumers Quebecers.
In fact, gaps and the dubious nature of the information make that 46% of consumers desechen this option.
It's the second obstacle identified by the barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say also distrust of the alleged returns on products or ecological services that are trying to sell.
On the other hand, nearly half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to comply with their convictions.
61% Has given priority to purchases in stores in your neighborhood and has preferred to buy food products cultivated in its region, said the barometer.
More green and responsible (responsible consumption rate has reached 64 points on a maximum of one hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves the position of the King of the recycling which seeks to reduce its impact on the environment concerned about the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the barometer, this social awareness seems to be doors (your car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of the Québec indicated that it had used public transport, or have shared car to defend its environmental principles.
39.1% Of the participants of this extensive survey of behavior, which has just completed its first edition, also supports the use of bicycles and displacement on foot.
A loan for the State to regain eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, who was asked to commit financially in the recovery of the complex of cinemas eXcentris pos Société Angus and the Parallèle, agree to collaborate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, a donation of seven million dollars of the Ministry of culture waiting to return to buy the complex film eXcentris on Boulevard Saint-Laurent, Daniel Langlois and give it back its true movie fan callingthey have not received what you asked for.
The Government has agreed to become involved in the matter, but on their own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec intends to loan the amount of which would, in effect, below initial expectations; This could be a viable solution in advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first plan of action and an application of 12.8 million, but since the applications have been revised downward.
The President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris file, submitted a proposal and a plan of action to the Minister St-Pierre.
He has sent a final report makes ten days.
However, the SODEC received a counter-proposal of the Cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have until December 31 to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a grant from the State should be discarded entirely.
Let us remember that the Association of owners of movie theaters and movie complexes of Quebec was opposed to a direct investment of the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of culture should not finance real estate projects, since that has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, various representatives of the sector does claim a considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the same, has led for ten years the burden of the cinema in their premises of the complex, after financing its own building, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had managed to retain their customers.
Company Angus and Parallèle, directed by Christian Yaccarini, push turn a campaign financing in private, hoping to collect $700,000 to pave way for the acquisition.
Since spring of 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, still projecting films eXcentris.
Prospective buyers aims to reopen the three rooms on 27 February, by projecting the precious film of Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux."
However, Christian Yaccarini has not returned to get in touch with Le Devoir and we do not know what to say he and his group of proposals down they have received.
The veil of the acomplejado Canada is lifted...
The new US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considered the complex of Canadians with respect to the Americans, but at the same time reflect the feeling of superiority of the latter to Canada.
American diplomats were surprised that voters Canadians do not think in Canada-United States relations when they go to vote and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the Conservative Government to ensure that its budget should be approved in 2009!
Four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday, they offer good juicy details that really substantial content.
A cable on September 22, 2008, i.e. during full federal election campaign, tells how the United States are not included in the issues discussed by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the American Ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations about this situation.
"Perhaps the political leaders are conditioned by an inferiority complex almost inherent to the Canadians in dealing with daily domestic concerns, rather than allow that choice to the United States (as during the campaign on the free trade of 1988) "He writes.
Therefore concludes, the United States are "the proverbial elephant in this election: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it."
The Ambassador has even more problems to understand this "deafening silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, it is of the view, the ability of a candidate of a party and, further, the head of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor in which the electors when voting should think about."
You can see this sense of importance also cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, to prepare the President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the survival of the Government during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, whereby Canada will register for the first time deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between 30,000 and 40,000 million dollars," writes Mr Breese.
Nowhere mentions that the Government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid that it replaced the coalition nor the opposition parties to reviewing their survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication of January 2008 signed by Ambassador Wilkins warning to Washington on the increasingly negative image that convey the drama series broadcast on the CBC's United States.
The Ambassador is concerned the issue of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even kidnapping so that the CIA carried out vigorous interrogation.
Another cable has, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to accommodate some prisoners at Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner replied Yes, but that depended on "of each case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "has delivered a document to the Secretary of State in connection with Omar Khadr, a Muslim from 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to revise the file."
Finally, we can mention that tempers on the WikiLeaks site have warmed.
Tom Flanagan, former adviser close to Stephen Harper, stated on CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive leakage should be "killed."
United States echo of Mike Huckabee.
A global plan to renew the lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancun a renewal plan of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to reduce the GHG (greenhouse) in an amount corresponding to one-third of the additional reduction which must be carried out to stabilise the climate of the planet by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the concrete set of large projects that UN expects it to take in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding commitments to reduce in the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent light bulbs, who still monopolize between 50% and 70% of the market, replaced by fluocompactas light bulbs or, even better, by diodes electroluminescentes bulbs (of the or "LED" in English), would avoid much of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate the human.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the global car park.
At Copenhagen, last year, the major sending countries, as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to reduction plans voluntary which should reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases from 53 to 49 Gt Gt.
However, even 5 Gt of that amount should be reduced to stabilize, by 2020, rising temperatures to two degrees Celsius to avoid that it is out.
In incandescent light bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated as heat, and the rest, i.e., 5%, produces light.
In the case of the fluocompactas light bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, still two times more energy consumption is reduced.
Fluocompactas bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, as that has launched the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the study of the United Nations), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulbwhich allows us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved by the replacement plan to be implemented in one hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with resistors and emit very little heat.
Above, they do not contain any mercury.
Various experts have expressed their reservations about the fluocompactas bulbs, because they contain mercury and that should be removed as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturers placed instructions.
However, the report, the main source of emission of mercury on the planet are not fluocompactas bulbs, but the coal thermal power stations that emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is wasted with incandescent light bulbs.
Only in United States, Central such emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages which would offer this international programme to each country.
For example, Indonesia would save so billion dollars per year in electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, i.e. the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power stations whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast looked forward to the announcement of election results
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the "immediate release" of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, given that the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need that the independent electoral Commission complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," highlights a spokesman for the head of the UN.
"Requests all the parties in Côte d'Ivoire and to institutions that demonstrate their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until they announce the provisional results."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign Governments, the electoral Commission has made that pass the deadline on Wednesday at midnight unless it published results, three days after the ballot on Sunday.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the President of the CIS had told television that the Commission "still working" to announce the results.
Wednesday have multiplied in the world claims that the CIS finally proclaim the name of the winner of the runoff between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent, Alassane Ouattara.
However, the side of Gbagbo has the annulment by the Constitutional Council of the "fraudulent" vote in the North, in the hands of the former rebellion of the new forces (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N' N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the President of Côte d'Ivoire, said that the maneuvers of intimidation of voters carried out by the FN in the North of the country had deterred the followers of outgoing President go to vote.
All the election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council has accepted complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, opponents of Gbagbo considered that the highest court in the country is not neutral, as it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North that denies any relationship with the former rebels, has been judged "unacceptable" delays in the publication of the results and has called on Gbagbo to respect them, but it has not gone so far as to claim the victory.
Allies say that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and to lodge a complaint with the Constitutional Council after failing to prevent that the electoral Commission the dissemination of results, would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections, on Sunday, should have put the icing on the process of reunification and reconciliation in a country divided in two years.
The United Nations warned on Wednesday to the political class of Ivory Coast, which could be held liable for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, October 31, with 38% of the vote compared to 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who was publicly supported by former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France remained stable at 9.3% in Mainland (9.7 per cent taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by data corrected with temporary seasonal (CVE) variations published Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed is 2.631.000 in continental France.
Data from the second quarter have been confirmed, a 9.3% of the active population in mainland and a 9.7% with the DOM.
In a year, the unemployment rate has been an increase of 0.1 points.
In general, 3.4 million people in the metropolitan France not working in the third quarter, but want to work, whether or not available in the two weeks to work and seek or no employment.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate, with a further increase in the unemployment rate up to 24.2% in continental France (+ 0.9 points in three months, + 0.5 points in one year), 25% including the DOM.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
Furthermore, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among people of old age, up to 6.4% in continental France (+ 0.2 points in three months and one year), i.e. 482.000 people of more than 50 yearsfigure that he amounts to 6.6% with the DOM.
Only a stability of unemployment among people aged between 25 and 49 years, with 8.3% in continental France has been registered (- 0.1 points in three months, + 0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% of all France.
The Insee has been since 2006 without publishing the monthly unemployment, after a controversy over their methods of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union Statistics Agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October, after a 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, directors of enterprises of waste treatment and brother of the PS President of the general Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been incarcerated in the prison of Luynes, near d'Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social goods, misappropriation of funds and public goods, cover-up, active corruption, influence peddling and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and will answer all the questions referred to it the judge, not ghosts."
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to show them," had declared to AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before the appearance of your client.
Mr Guérini, brother of the leader of the PS in the Department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted to convey through their lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to be explained.
The Wednesday night began to investigate and was also imprisoned at one of their close people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr Lucien Simon, only thing that has made its client has been dealing with landfills that must be managed.
With regard to the allocation of the contracts or the destination of the funds associated with its implementation, you know nothing in this regard, said the lawyer Simon.
Within the framework of this dossier, is also being investigated since Wednesday Daniel Pinna, former director-general of services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, for embezzlement and complicity, but have left you on probation and has prohibited to meet with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts which have reproached."
"The examining magistrate has taken into account the explanations and has left him in freedom," said his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux.
The night of Tuesday to Wednesday they interrogated four others and those left the freedom, under judicial control in the case of two of them, as indicated by the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy director-general of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused by "traffic of influences and passive corruption."
Two officials of the city of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Piaget, have been questioned by "theft and embezzlement of public property by a person dedicated to public service" and "complicity in embezzlement of public funds," respectively.
Finally, the companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated by "cover-up of the abuse of social goods."
Among those that have faced Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent contracts affecting Corsica contained to Mr Guérini.
The researchers suspect that their societies have service for laundering capital of the Grand banditry.
Research is being conducted within the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation said that investigations are concentrated especially in the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill site in La Ciotat, which collects the waste of Aubagne, as well as other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Subject Clotilde Reiss: the Élysée has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and may 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage," has been in suspense to the public in France, has been alerted to the diplomacy and has exacerbated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of diplomats from United States.
U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde revealed certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
Describe how the Elysee has explained his strategy the Americans to the point of giving them advice for managing their own crisis of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of shining path).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the French young there was in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and sought by the American justice system for traffic of materials for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, to reveal the harsh reality of how the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea of that the Syrian President, Bashar Al - Assad, had played a key role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, he did nothing.
A diplomatic telegram drafted on August 12, 2009 in Paris entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage cases of hostage-taking."
The Chief of the Elysee for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay to North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talk with the American diplomatic Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
Advised the Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens held forcibly in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "soltad continuously" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release."
All to shame the Iranian, careful scheme of its image.
"When the Iranians will ask you to stop, do it more often still."
Because, once exhausted attempts at negotiation by discrete channels, "silence will does not solve anything," the Iranians are "experts in delaying tactics."
Mr Richier adds that the detention of aliens is "a common Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail."
Announces that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, day in which refugiará at the France Embassy) will "require payment to Iranians for a lot of money" (230,000 euros reward).
In addition, noted that the Élysée anticipates other hostage crisis, a phenomenon which "will increase."
The Iranians could "in the near future stop to another of about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," affirms.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss leaves prison after twelve days, but is blocked by Iran.
The following information: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition request the United States by illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, has been released in Paris by a decision of a judge.
The American Embassy, as many observers doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which close to clandestine networks Iranian purchase of equipment for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted an Exchange?
Does freeing the Iranian in exchange for the French?
For a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4, François Richier warrants that it wasn't.
The Elysee, says, not only "is was greatly surprised by the decision of the judge," but it has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "The French Government can not override the decision," said.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand continues under the "close" surveillance of French information services.
Adviser to the Élysée dials a phone number, hangs and, later, reports to the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in a Paris buildings managed by the Iranian Embassy."
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Élysée sparing no efforts, use releases and "leaks" organized in the media to believe that the Syrian President Bachar Al - Assad played an "important" and "influential" role of "mediator."
Americans observed this activity with some irony and check that the manipulation brings fruit, since several articles of press transmitted the French official version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions "the ' blitz' media of French officials."
Why is this "gratitude" to Mr Assad, asked the Embassy in Paris.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials acknowledge privately only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have done really."
Then, the document deals with the reasons which have led to the Élysée to give rise to this fiction.
The great effort of communication "is intended to validate policy of openness towards Syria Sarkozy," is of the view.
A policy initiated in 2008, "in the view of many critical voices, in France and abroad just be barred from premature and desmerecida."
Talking up"the Syrian role," Paris is trying to "show to Syria the praise that can be harvested if it plays a constructive role in the region."
The objective is also to "sowing the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The American Embassy knows that good source.
August 11, François Richier entrusts to him: "of course, don't know if the Syrians have done something or not."
"But anyway, so we have thankful."
"This should at least lead to confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at the Élysée.
Said in a statement, thanks to the Presidents of Senegal, Brazil and Sirius have played an "active role for the release of our countryman."
From midnight, Korean youth may not play online
The South Korean Government will adopt a so-called law "of Cinderella" that would prevent adolescents to participate in online games after midnight by blocking their access, as indicated officials.
In December will be submitted a draft law to Parliament to call on the business of online games that block access to these games after midnight to young people under 16 years, as indicated representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
"Many children play all night, and then find it difficult to study in school and lead a normal life during the day."
"We think that this law is necessary to protect their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rhine, responsible ministerial charge of the Bill.
Online games will be again available at six in the morning.
The companies will have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law, required.
The Government arises also urge companies limit time of daily access to these games when requested by the parents of young people, added the Manager.
In addition, will be available to who request free software allowing to limit the time of connection to the Internet.
Korea of the South is one of the more "connected" countries and newspapers provide news regularly on various facts related to an intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where he faced 58 others.
2018-2022 World: FIFA appoints organizers countries
In the midst of the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, the Executive Committee of FIFA appoints Thursday organizers countries of 2018 and 2022 world cups, a choice clearly policy where the struggles of influence and the lobbying might take precedence over the technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the edition of the competition for the FIFA 2018 will be held in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and countries Bajos-Bélgica).
The 2022 Edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), following a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or proceed with their implementation in the United States or in the far East (Japan) (Korea South).
The list of personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, the Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the heads of Belgian and Dutch Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests at stake in a world.
Behind the scenes transactions, therefore, it is possible that they last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the report of evaluation of FIFA, English entries, renacentistas (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than its competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight to the 22 members of the Executive Committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could be ruined as well opportunities for his country, cradle of soccer, which just hosted the world once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood to the fire on Monday to broadcast a documentary that has highlighted three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to upset with FIFA and shame English leaders, who have taken to an intensive lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron to the head.
The head of Government expected to republish the blow with success by his predecessor, Tony Blair, which had managed the Organization of the JJ in 2005 for London.OO. 2012.
This intense activity, will be sufficient to recover the brightness of England before the EC?
It is not clear, given that the Spain-Portugal duo has also numerous points strong thanks to their stadiums, ready, his (world experience of 82 in Spain, JJ.) OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the Dim economic and financial prospects of both countries could take down ambitions.
Possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal get only give points to Russia, converted to an outsider of weight despite the gaps in his candidacy (stadiums, hotels) (, transportation).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced a "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in a direct allusion to the British press charges against the members of the EC.
"Are taking out their dirty laundry, attempting to commit them," said Putin.
2022, The United States, who have the experience of 1994, seem the more logical favorites.
First world economic power and headquarters of the main sponsors of the FIFA, the country seems to take advantage Japan and Korea of the South, that have developed separately an excellent project.
However, these new applications seem premature for two countries that have organized together the Championship in 2002.
Another risk: the granting of the 2026 world to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would lead to Asia stay without possibilities to 2022.
By Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue with its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries have more risks than certainties.
Australia, Japan and Korea, could also be adversely affected by the weakness of the TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the test
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had given to understand that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have not the slightest doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less still.
A term in the Elysee leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of State will be candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not combine well with the mystery that is often associated with the presidential role.
Therefore, it always have to pretend that he doubts.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, although they do not believe it, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that he not ruling out a third term.
On 15 November, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that it would take its decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011."
Therefore, the fact that dealt with the MEPs from the UMP, on Tuesday night at the Elysee, the possibility of "two terms" has caused some uproar.
Is it the official announcement of his candidacy?
Not much less.
The only President indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 limited to two the number of five-year terms.
It simply transmitting facts, not an advertisement.
It is not the first time that speaks of the presidential elections, with a humorous tone, in meetings of this kind.
"At worst, or better, cases, yet you pasaréis seven and a half years with me," was released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "I do not think that I do not wonder what will come afterwards."
His claims of day before yesterday not him closer to the nomination, nor less.
They give rise to comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the nomination in the Socialist Party, on the one hand.
But isn't the fact that Ségolène Royal has risen to the fore leading to Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
On the contrary; the fact of his candidacy in 2012 is obvious is what leads to many people of the Socialist Party to claim that you organize the battle earlier than expected.
On the other hand, the poor opinion polls.
For the first time right voters prefer the candidacy of François Fillon, Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the topic," reacted immediately and prudently the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If you think that you can lose, will not be candidate," believes Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"I always think that you can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned themselves to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is forced to keep their acquisitions of State letters
The last meeting of the Board of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be allowed to specify the modalities of the crisis or, at least, announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations which should conclude at the end of the year.
Because the European sovereign debt crisis, Institute of emission of Frankfurt certainly not can afford to be so urgent if you don't want to risk aggravating a situation rather than complicated today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be as high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, has supported the active role played by the ECB for the solution of the debt crisis of the European States.
He has refused to say if he believed that the central bank should do more, for example increasing its program of buying of State obligations.
"I reserve my opinion to my European colleagues...."
The eve, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on economic and monetary of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, showed no more eloquent in its intentions, stating only that the letters of the State in the secondary market purchase program was "continuing" and that "we'll see what we decided to" during the meeting on Thursday.
One thing that is clear is that the ECB will maintain its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of obligations of the Treasury by the ECB has doubled last week to nearly 1,350 million euros.
In addition, according to the prying operators of the market, yesterday would have again purchased titles Irish and Portuguese.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have acquired titles by 67,000 million euros from May 2010.
Between the operators of the market, no doubt is the least that will continue to purchase (see page 29).
Economists do not provide any significant changes of direction.
Although the operations of loans to more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, it still performs unlimited allocations of liquidity to beneficial conditions and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect that this device now extends for a few months.
"I can't imagine that it will considerably modify his program."
"If not, would risk provoking new tension in the short term," thinks Michael Schubert, an economist of Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that there will be a gradual departure announced during the first quarter of 2011," Norbert Bräms, Economist at salt it anticipates by his side.
Oppenheim.
In relation to interventions in the market for public debt, "the ECB should maintain a volume purchase of such obligations to keep the market stable," added Norbert Bräms.
Taking into account the importance of the exhibitions of European banks to markets in the euro zone sovereign debt, the Institute of broadcast has no choice but that maintain their presence in the market.
"Must compensate for the lack of investors in the market at any price and act in such a way to prevent a sharp rise of income paid by the most fragile States," opined yesterday an important Manager of obligations.
Because, if interest rates through the roof, the States will have even more problems to reduce their indebtedness, or even to stabilize it.
This is the price to protect the euro.
In Italy, Berlusconi's Government recovered the temporary
Once Italy has started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of the types of obligations to 10 years.
A precarious calm recovery.
At the exit of a meeting with the Minister of economy, regional Presidents have claimed that they listened to Giulio Tremonti described the situation of "indecipherable" and that expected a "unpredictable" weekend, statements subsequently denied by the person concerned.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with long-term German rates had reached the figure record of 210 basis points and the price of hedging against the risk of bankruptcy (CRQ) had skyrocketed up to 263 pointscausing a certain stir in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" by "the turbulence in the markets" and by a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third-largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is as Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, Economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, your problem is the lack of growth and stagnation in income associated with it, what causes State to run the risk of not to meet their financing needs.
The latest forecasts of Brussels have brought a jug of cold water for the Government.
It is estimated that Italian growth reached 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4 per cent in 2012, while the budget which is being considered in the Senate is based on figures from 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.
In these circumstances, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP (compared to 3.9% envisaged by the Government) next year and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7 per cent).
Hence the rumor that can apply new budgetary arrangements after the holidays, an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, must be new austerity measures," believes the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The bases of its economy are in order and your accounts in good condition, as we have been saying it for a long time," says Arrigo Sa'dun, Italian Manager responsible for Italy in the IMF International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, or to short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, REKINDLE), stabilization efforts required from Italy are less than those required in other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, Chief Economist of the OECD.
The problem of political instability is.
December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a censure motion in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could anticipate at the end of March.
In this case, open up a period of little conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are reflecting on the strengthening of mechanisms for the fight against the crisis
Christine Lagarde has already yesterday during a press conference in Paris said: "I believe that we have already demonstrated on Sunday, by night and by day, that Europeans are clearly solidarity, determined, committed to the defence of its currency and its monetary zone."
Although it was relative, relaxation recorded yesterday in the types of the obligations of the European States has led Governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot talk yet of a principle of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could lower the rating of the debt of Portugal, more frequent target currently speculation.
"As in may, really lack political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems," say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "the political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets."
Aware of this hiatus, and of the dangers that hides, European countries intensify discussions to strengthen the mechanisms of the already existing crisis.
The informal consultations between the Ministers of finance which are most directly affected and, in general, with their counterparts from the G-20 are going in the right direction.
And this taking into account also the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin Council at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
The order of the day, the type of non-conventional measures of support to the countries of the euro area in the collimator of markets (see above).
With regard to the European Fund for financial stability (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began on Tuesday in Singapore a tour of Asia to inform investors of the far East on the developments in the crisis in Europe.
Although the aim of these visits does not consist of fund-raising, it certainly paves the way.
It is expected that the first issues of the EFSF titles take place next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official representative entrusted with the Reuters agency that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct engagement of the IMF.
The countries located in first line, Portugal and Spain, they prepare to adopt structural reforms, in particular regarding the Organization of the labour market.
These reforms are added to measures of austerity with immediate effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move in a direction different from that followed by Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid at all costs apply for international aid soon to implement its own budget corrections and decide structural reforms deemed necessary to increase confidence on a lasting basis.
Venture capital partners of European funds, finally, arise the options available to expedite the process of normalization of public bond markets.
Passing through Paris, November 24, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea of that, if the 750,000 million mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union will not hesitate to return to take the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, an actor of the first line on the market of the European public debt, consider that an amount of around 100 billion additional euros would suffice, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
The instrument for it exists: the European financial stabilization mechanism, currently worth € 60 billion.
A Council, could certainly examine in detail the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in alert Orange
Snowfalls are causing difficulties in movement, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and can affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are currently in alert Orange due to the risk of snow and ice.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne had joined twenty departments that were already on alert Orange, eighteen since Wednesday at midday, and two, Dordogne and Gironde region, joined the Group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snow falls affect Northern Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly in France island.
Expect a few layers of snow between 2 and 5 cm, promptly between 7-10 cm, the departments concerned, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the island of France and Limousin-Normandie regions.
Snowfalls are sufficiently strong to cause difficulties in movement and affect some economic activities, alert Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, the access to several departmental roads to heavy goods vehicles over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion axes and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac is prohibited.
According to the gendarmes, circulation in the secondary network of Britain is complicated, by what they recommend that no drive except in cases of necessity and certain TER vehicles is prohibited during the day.
During Thursday, the school transport has been banned in Picardy.
Not planned no specific action on Wednesday night to limit the circulation of heavy goods vehicles.
The Prefecture "urged all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation."
The directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) requested airlines to repeal Thursday 25% of its flights at Paris airport of Roissy, and 10% at Orly because of anticipated snowfall.
The DGAC recommends to passengers that are in contact with your airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, South London, and Edinburgh, in Scotland, they are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of the transport on the island of France reached its peak, they rain billions.
At least, in the debate.
In particular, talk about the 23 billion for the metro Grand Paris who should build the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of 4,000 million euros.
At the theoretical level, this sum will be which will later allow the GSP borrow on the markets to finance a portion of its double loop.
Today, we finally have the first accounts.
The Finance Act amendment of 2010, examined in the National Assembly Finance Committee this morning, contains the devices provided to find the first part of that money.
There are two modes: the creation of a special tax of equipment and the increase of tax offices in the island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: "the proceeds of this tax is 117 million euros a year."
The second is an amendment to a tax on offices that already exists "to modernise it, increase your product and allocate it to the Société du Grand Paris."
How much would be obtained with this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it is far from 4 billion.
"Requires fiscal resources are added to the 4 billion euros in the allocation of funds that will mobilize the State and that will be given to the Société du Grand Paris to measure to move the project," we can read in the explanatory statement.
The GSP was not surprised by this system.
"To start from the time income (the two taxes, indications) are created, we can cover studies for three years and then receive four billion later, as we explain."
"It was recorded in the budget and will be used according to needs."
The GSP calculates that it empecerá to receive the 4 billion in 2013 to 2014 budget.
This device, in which 4 billion promised are not included in the credit, may cause a slightly on parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on December 7.
Avengers hackers and industrious spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that just seems scandal before the hypocrisy governing relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, announces sweeping changes at the international level and provides for a future dominated by the regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which he belongs) is exclusively formed by press cuttings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual mores of Berlusconi just reflect what has been written months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and profile ominously Khadafi ridiculizador takes a long time giving ideas to the cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule according to which the secret dossiers must only be formed by news of public knowledge is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosicrucian) exactly what he had written in the earlier works.
This is not only that the authors of occult texts do not want to make previously unpublished research (or do not know where to look for updates on the non-existent), but because who are dedicated to the occult does not only rely on what they already knowWhat to reconfirm what had already learned.
This is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
The same applies to secret records.
The reporter is lazy, just as it is lazy (or has little desire) the head of the secret services (if you could be, I what I know, editor of the Libération), which only considers true what can recognize.
The top secret information on Berlusconi sent to the American Embassy in Rome at the State Department was the same Newsweek published the previous week.
Then, why have the revelations of these records caused such a stir?
On the one hand, just say what a cultivated person already know, i.e. that the embassies, at least since the second world war and since the heads of States can call on the phone or catch the plane to meet for dinnerthey have lost their function diplomatic and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, have become centres of espionage.
Any viewer who sees films of research knows well, only aparentamos that we do not know for hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact of repeating publicly breach the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that an any hacker can consult more secrets of the most powerful country in the world secrets considerably affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and "executioners."
But we go into the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly, at the time of Orwell, could be designed to all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of their subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, being able to control every motion with the phone, every transaction, visited hotel, taken Highway, the citizen he became thus a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when is demonstrated, as it does now, that even the Crypts of the secrets of the power can not escape the control of a hacker, the relationship of control is no longer unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls for every citizen, but every citizen (unless the hacker, chosen as the Avenger of the people) can know all the secrets of the power.
How can withstand a power that can no longer nor conserve its own secrets?
It is true, as already said Georg Simmel, that a true secret is a secret vacuum (and a vacuum secret may never be revealed); It is also true that all knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi and Merkel is in fact a vacuum, without secret secret, given that it comes from the public sphere; but disclosing, as did WikiLeaks, the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to remove all power.
WikiLeaks has not done any harm to Sarkozy and Merkel, but itself, and much, Clinton and Obama.
What are the consequences of this wound caused by a powerful power?
It is evident that in the future, States already not may bring into the network any classified information, because that would be to post on a poster on the street.
But it also is clear that with today's technologies, cannot be expected to maintain confidential conversations on the phone.
Nothing is easier to discover if and when a head of State has moved by air and has been in contact with one of the counterparts.
How be able to stay in the future private and confidential relations?
I am well aware that, for the time being, my forecast is science fiction, and therefore, novelistic, but I imagine government agents moving discreetly in proceedings with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, as much, hiding some data written on the heels of their shoes.
This information is then preserved in a single copy in locked drawers: in the end, the attempt of Watergate spy was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that the technology currently running as a crab, i.e. backwards.
A century before the Telegraph wireless has revolutionized communications, Internet has returned to create a Telegraph (telephone) cables.
(Analog) video tapes had enabled the film researchers study a movie step by step, advancing and retreating, discover all the secrets of the Assembly, while now the (digital) CD only allow forward or back of chapter in chapterthat is, to huge proportions.
With high speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while aircraft, with the movements involved, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is not anything out of the ordinary policy and communication techniques lead us back to the car of horses.
One final comment.
Formerly, the press was trying to understand what is ominously in secret in the embassies.
At present, are embassies which call for confidential information to the press.
Climate: the bungling of France in their promises of funding
A year later of the Copenhagen accord, it is time to examine if the promises of funding quickly unblocked are respected (called fast start or early) carried out by developed countries.
And they have revealed the French bungling.
In the Copenhagen accord, the developed countries committed themselves to provide 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged 7.2 billion euros in three years and France 1,260 million euros (i.e. 420 million a year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has put on the table their best cards to convince its partners that its commitment to the fast start funding is real: a report detailing the actions of its Member Statesa wheel press, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
Operation transparency proved to be significant and it was appreciated for what it's really worth: in developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it has released 2010 € 2.2 billion, which places it in the right direction towards the fulfilment of its commitment to 7.2 billion in 2012.
But, if we look at the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen accord, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure holding a complementary effort, without prejudice to the official development aid.
Unfortunately, it has never been to agree on what "new and additional."
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Currently, everyone choose the reference that fits him best.
For example, the European Commission has taken as reference year 2009: maintaining international funding and added 150 million over three years in fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references with regard to the year or at the level of official aid to development.
On the other hand, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" of the year 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there is reference to the cost of previous years or the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even lower), while intended to respect its commitment in the field of "new and additional" funding...
Another crucial element, the distribution between grants and loans.
Once again, there is no standard and each of which chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that every euro borrowed amounts to a donated euro.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of borrowing may be justified for certain investments which are cost-effective (often, projects relating to reducing emissions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is fallacious to introduce a euro that is going to recover as equivalent to a euro donated... As much, just be should compute their commitment the cost of the loan for the country which granted the loan (i.e., the equivalent to a rate of interest).
But France don't find useful this reasoning: "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million making a 91,5% of loans (EUR 389,8 million) and 8.5 per cent of donations (EUR 36.1 million); see the document of the EU to see it with their own eyes.
It's the only country of the Union that so often uses the loan.
Germany using it at 46%, while Denmark, Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% of donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes euro to fulfill its commitment, France only provides ten cents and believes that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In short, fast start funding, France performs a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to time and, on the other hand, actions in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending just EUR 36.1 million, get the impression that spent 420 million "new and additional," as had been promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy who has dealt with arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why leaving the other Member States to continue donating when they can simply pay?) as in the negotiationsSince developing countries are not stupid...
The chapter of the early funding is a very small mouse, relatively short term, in relation to the whole of the negotiations on the climate.
But it might be a grain of sand in the vast machinery which is the UNFCCC.
Hopefully that it is not the case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
First of all, France could announce a change in its method of calculation for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention to respect its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France could they capital discussions on bets at stake in connection with the financing in the long run (another essential chapter which is currently being discussed): no us crop of the question of the "additionality" or the method to compute the loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive in relation to this issue as it is with others.
Therefore, we have the hope of the new Minister of environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, which will arrive in Cancun next week.
An advertisement surprise about the fast start of France and his vision of the "additionality" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence necessary to make progress in the negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old boy eats in a day 81 chemicals different, according to a study published Wednesday by the Association Générations Futures (the former movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The Association, which warns that their results "do not have a statistical significant value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the treated problems," purchased in supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and September food that tends to consume a boy of about ten years in four meals and a snack a day.
These meals taken as a model, who respect the official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day), as well as candy, were examined in laboratories in search of chemical substancespesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 classified as carcinogenic potential or probable and five substances classified as carcinogenic insurance, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to the studies of various institutions such as the International Center for research on cancer.
"But, in practically all cases, are not exceeded legal limits for each individual chemical substances, our study shows clearly that the exposure of consumers to contaminants probably carcinogenic and/or PE is worrying"says the Association.
For breakfast, tea with milk and butter contain alone over a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three regarded as carcinogenic insurance, as well as close to a score of waste that can affect the hormone system.
Apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to beans of Kenya, including in the food, in which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the Russian filet, canned tuna and even the loaf of bread or gum were aderezados with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the analysis discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the slice of salmon was the most "nutritious" with 34 detected chemical waste and even the analysis of the plate of plastic used for heating food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk that generate these "cocktails of contaminants" to the consumer "probably underestimated," says the study.
The Alliance Europe ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "to the gravity of the situation" implement a moratorium on the use of pesticides to halt "the increase in diseases associated with civilization."
In July, a study of the European Agency for food safety (EASA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
