That počne? The CSSD and the Czech Social Democratic Party] in Prague, he does not know Voldemorta or a candy store
The councilor new capital from the CSSD and the Czech Social Democratic Party] will have apparently to overcome some of the language barrier, in Prague council and the corporations they understood the renewed colleagues from the Czech ODS Democratic Party].
Newspaper Aktuálně.cz members of the new proposals from the CSSD and the Czech Social Democratic Party] " tried," as they know, flagrantly introduced the slang that have arisen in recent years at the town hall, when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
Coded vocabulary that Prague political elite has introduced during the previous era of Chief Magistrate paul Bém, described some of the best-known characters in the state and of cases in the metropolis.
Surprisingly it turned out that the new councilor familiar ideas too does not understand.
At least so says.
"Who is that?" Voldemort
"I really do not know."
"I am in Prague, rather, a" novice responded to the test " kmotrovského" of vocabulary councilor for culture Kaucký Lukas.
And though this is a political veteran, responded similarly, a councilor of charles březina.
Perhaps the idea of " golf hole."
"It is the only phrase from those that make me that I sometimes use."
"Otherwise, slang I generally do not recognise."
From the vocabulary that the phrases Aktuálně.cz the journal published this year in the June election before Congress [Czech ODS Democratic Party] chose the redactions six examples, mostly those that are flagrantly linked to Prague municipality.
Socialists had to explain the terms " Voldemort" " the greatest golf hole in Prague," "to go to the candy store," " bullish" necks, " the betrayal of the capital" and " oplechovat."
Three from councillors with the quiz agreed, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, which has still to be in charge -- education - first interview, later promised earlier but did not take telephone.
The fifth councilor peter Dolínek rejected a direct test.
"These things I do not address both are talking a Democrat, I will not judge."
"I now work out how we will see in our programs," responded.
As i read, Lukas Kaucký councilor in the headline amount reportedly did not recognise that he is talking about an influential businessman and friend exprimátora Béma Romanu Janouškovi.
" Voldemort" Kauckému him there is nothing to say, and the only term, which in the test correctly estimated, is " the greatest golf hole in Prague."
"It is tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, and adds: immediately "But I know more from the newspaper."
"I will have to pay some language course," banters.
Golf hole after a tunnel Blanka administration not only decodes the matador by charles březina, but a councilor for the environment Plachý Lukas.
Both the social democrats then he knows who is truly Voldemort, and Lukas Plachéma that is familiar and where that figure could find - feels the meaning of the phrase "go to the candy store."
"I think this money to go to some Prague company," is holding back near a solution that goes against the seat Janouškových of companies.
Consistently with březina notes that knowledge to draw more from the newspaper to the kind of vocabulary used.
No similar zaběhnutý vocabulary slangových of rhetoric does not exist in social democracy according to participants in the test.
"I have consulted with a colleague, but it seems that really such thing we do not have."
"We are saying rather names, sometimes use abbreviations and zkomoleniny names," says the president of the CSSD Prague, the Czech Social Democratic Party] peter Hulínský, whose nickname party-men Hulda.
"At school i said birch, but I do not know whether i am so they say, and colleagues" have confessed to his own nickname of charles březina.
Newspaper Aktuálně.cz name to try and running.
Councilor Weinert, for the party-men of grand dad or less friendly grandfather, representative, Miroslav Poche, who was wearing before the election, warned the fraud at sponsoring party, has at some fellow nickname " Igráček."
Dubbed they are also the only social democrats in intra-party speech they admit.
Hulínský it is said Huldu not hears happy, but Aktuálně.cz newspaper noted and other nickname of the Prague president.
" the doctor obuškového of justice" it is said that peter Hulínský won the title JUDr. at the police academy.

Bakalův tenant. Stokes in kamnech, higher lease signed
Older chunky men stepped forward from the door of client companies RPG the apartments ' uhlobarona" of Zdenka Bakaly, the largest private owner of residential apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under arm took part in her new apartment treaty into three flats. the daughter and son, who is in the execution of sentence.
All three is what deregulation, lease.

Civil union BytyOKD.cz that the new apartment condition described as " incorrect and immoral," advises tenants of the new treaty not to sign and expect to 7, when he publishes guidance, as against them to proceed.
But mr above all just wave of the hand.
"One is saying this, the second of it," mračí.
Ostrava, has become a major laboratory of deregulation.
After New Year's Day expecting a large majority of homes in the Czech Republic as yet no rental market.
Aktuálně.cz has therefore decided to visit a " laboratory" personally.
Havířovská waiting room RPG is one of a total of four on Ostravsku and on Tuesday at nine in the morning is already full.
Immediately next to the door stands security guards from the safety agency and when it vyvolávací facility.
" rental" 2011, radiates special button on his dotykovém screen.
One ťuknutí and the machine will go out stationery with the numbers.
You will not prosecute or read " 157" and your character, peeps on the big screen below the ceiling of waiting room.
For half seconds you are in a row.
On a lease for a moment comes to request an elderly couple, rush in the waiting room, but new leases apparently does not cover.
Most people would come to fix common problems as ever - claims for repairs, claims and the like.
Letters with the new treaty is receiving apartment on Ostravsku of postal packets to the tenants of the most of a total of 44 thousand homes of portfolio from RPG around the middle of November.
RPG apartments them in the letters suggest an increase in lease about 15 to 38 percent.
A special unit to new leases were on client centre open. the autumn of 18.
"It is running through the week, so it is only in záběhu," they reply worker for the unit after a moment of hesitation, when the client imagis as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakalovy former coalmining apartments is a local irritable subject.
Before the election, he took enough halasně vice - president of house and home Lubomír Ostrava Zaorálek from the CSSD and the Czech Social Democratic Party], and now they are full of local newspapers.
" twenty years after chcu new floor."
"Neither the pos. .anou panel on the other room, i did not replace," feels relieved in úvodou the man.
Most so far, according to researchers from pensioners to be seen whether they will receive rebates from the lease if he will sign in time, as RPG them in a special offer promises.
Half of the reductions to únorový the lease will receive the other tenants, who will sign a new treaty to 15. December.
Havířovská " deregulating" separation but questions zahlcena certainly is not.
"From yesterday's of 360 clients because of the lease for of 2011 was just about forty up to fifty people," estimated worker for the department.
RPG at the same time on the web and bulletin boards is proposing a separate negotiation of contracts where necessary.
However, if the rental of both parties fail to agree, he will have to setup an independent tribunal.
"It is not about threats, but on information about possible and perfectly legitimate legal process," warns RPG on the website.
"There is nobody to think it will not be," thinks one of the scientists RPG apartments and the man in the street in front of her client centre gives partly on the fact.
"I have 13 thousand pensions and leaves me five thousand for food, I do not have to be idea," he says.
But Worker immediately afterwards, after all znejistí.
"We will see."
"Mr Zaorálek them in the media is, they do not sign, so people expected," thinks.
The rules of leases up the majority of the Czech Republic with the new 2011 and under RPG the apartments is their increased economic necessity.
"The current rent he still does not reach even greater need for simple maintenance housing fund," recalls paul Klimeš, director of residential portfolio of companies RPG apartments that naštvaným a tenant vytýkaná the disrepair housing fund, according to the homeowners the main reason for the increase in leases.
While for five years between of 2005 and 2010, they could RPG from the leases invest in apartments, four billion in four years between 2011 and 2014 it should be 5,2 billion.
Large-surface screen hanging at the ceiling opposite polstrovaným the seats havířovské of waiting room while repeating a few red zvýrazněných information.
"The increase in rent for 2011 by 15%, and less about 31 of the 200 apartments, that is more than 90% apartments RPG."
"And it always will be a maximum of 7,50 Kč for the meter square and months," will appear on the screen.
Only 400 apartments from the portfolio RPG the lease will rise by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is an increase from extremely - low amounts of of 19,66 Kč for the meter square," warns RPG.
Many as 2600 homes will go next year to lease the same.
RPG apartments promised that deregulation is not going to oust leases skokově, but will be spread to four to eight years.
In addition, it adds a further commitment: all of the money from an increase in the lease (see graph) will put the company back to their homes, mainly to thermal savings - new windows and warming.
Preferably have to recognise the people who will sign an agreement to increase leases.
In the offices include the kindergartens, understood the architects
Public buildings Avriopoint in Brně is a new seat of the company Arch.Design.
No one should expect that there is also miniškolku with all that this belongs - with colourful walls, creative furniture, accumulate for toys and even a miniature hřištěm to external terrace.
Since the October of last year it can visit the children of employees Arch.Designu.
Projekčně-architectonic company Arch.Design, from jejíchž the studios have come from a number of significant Brno structures, calculated with space for service miniškolku from his tracings to build Avriopoint.
He employs almost 90 people, mostly aged babyboomu and it depended on a woman projektantky and architects they can quickly return to work.
Along with the possibility of a truncated duties, kindergartens benefitem, which Arch.Design offers employees as part of a social agenda.
Stavařky and architect and be able to join the hard work with childcare.
Miniškolku it was invented by an employee Arch.Designu and with the support of the leadership they have managed to get subsidies, the European Union and the labour Government and social affairs.
Service miniškolka is funded by the european social fund through an operating program of human resources and jobs, and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grantovému funding (subsidy of 2, 8 million. Kč) could buy equipment and facilities and for a period of two years to provide qualified personnel and operations.
After the financial subsidies (2) Arch.Design company has an obligation for of 3 years to operate miniškolku for their own expense.
Preparation for the project lasted a year and an application for funding significantly helped the company Economy rating.
Care provides qualified personnel, the children celodenně care for nurses and teachers OF the MASSES, kindergartens, then, can set the children without age restrictions, however, are the most over 3 years.
Because this is about " miniškolku" gift can be while only 5 children during the day, they will replace, and more.
The kindergartens, flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right kindergartens to use whatever the hierarchy of position in society.
Although this is an individual education and care programme content in miniškolce is comparable to the program's pre-school education.
Children are not only play, but it is them and ensure high-quality training - from basic cognition after a run-up in school benches, and is taught English language.
Class is equipped with not just an exciting toys, games, and a computer which children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates an amicable and positive environment.
Parents can ever stop child and revolt stresové situation with a late vyzvedáváním of children from nurseries away from the workplace of parents.
Parents, take hours produktivněji.
No wonder there is developing naturally loyal relationship employees - employers.
So Arch.Design joined by Czech companies that offer a significant advantage in recruiting new staff are friendly to the family and through this scheme would boost personal marketing.
House of the bones fascinates even after 100 years. The interiors of Gaudího
Roof looks like a prehistoric the back stairs lizard, recalling the backbone of dinosaur and balconies are open to fish mouth.
Such is his home in Casa Batlló Barcelona from katalánského the architect of Anton Gaudího.
From local, home through organic shapes serve the nickname house of the bones.
Organic shapes, colours, gross proceeds of unusual stone, the tokens of mosaic tiles and, commemorating the front of the scale and universal soft curves, all this is typical of the shebrie of Anton Gaudího.
Frontage of a house rozehrává dreamy line, soft colour and texture commemorating nature and animals.
For detailed observations can be seen geometričnost, the rhythm and it was thought out the rules.
At night the entire front home is still dramatičtěji, is nasvícená to the impression of the shine of colours and umocněn.
Windings, and the torsion of shapes with equally, and the interiors.
Forest in the waves copies window frameworks, railings, ornamental elements of the glass doors, and ledges.
The house Batlló that arises in the Eixample district on a busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia no 43, there was a reconstruction of a house of of 1877 from the architect Emilio shala city Cortese.
Reconstruction is conducted two years ago and his home has been completed for 1906.
Investor, a wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on the demolition of the old structures and build entirely new, of course, soon made Gaudího idea of unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
Rental house Casa Batlló Anton Gaudís but did not suggest.
Cooperated with her architect Josep Maria Jujol.
On his projektantském plank was ornament for the prestige of the apartment owners of property and use of mosaic at the front.
At the front worked, and many other creators and performers.
The joint work on the advice of a house Casa Batlló launched a successful collaboration Jujola with Gaudím.
Jujol engaged in the design Gaudího of Casa nice house and a park Güell where they are more Gaudího work.
From local, his home shortly after completion has served as a result of organic shapes nickname " the house of the bones."
Another him because of a specific mechanism for development of windows started to call "zívajícím the house of commons."
It is said that at the top of the structure is vypodobněn the sword st george, a benefactor Catalonia.
Hidden religious motives included and other sculptural elements of the structure.
Gaudí to the house has proposed for time a central heating system with odvětrávacími the air holes and distinctive chimneys.
It may seem bizarre them - forty-five stupňový tendencies.
Absolutely did not regard what was then the building regulations and did not allow them to have in creating Gaudí.
At the beginning of construction may be obtained from the city a building permit, of course, it reported data on planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, the city government was the result threatens to end and called for redress.
Radním mattered for example, that the structure has hit the post and public sidewalk.
To remedy there has never been, on the contrary: just fifteen days after the challenge urban areas, Josep Batlló applied successfully (and winning) authorisation for the rental of two top five blocks.
Her owner moved in to lower five.
In the gallery on the second floor, social, and the chamber on the third floor of the bedroom and private parts of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented jewelry.
The entire house šestipatrový intersects the stairs, which will be given to stand up to the roof terrace.
Key elements of the overhaul was the abolition of all the angles and direct line and their replacement false walls.
Gaudí also worked with modern concept of putting together the universe.
Social component is launching a salonních of doors entirely to connect and larger society together can comfortably communicate without also did not maintain privacy is essential for more intimate conversations.
A house with Gaudího reconstruction gathered outside the new fronts also non-traditional roofing and two floors.
It is an impressive and Gaudího game with the light - blue and bíle glazované tile, which is the tile internal auditors, and sky-lights.
Interplay of two colours gives a maximum of light across the floors of the house.
There was simply to on the principle that reflects a white light over dark, and the rays of sunlight instead absorbed.
The house Casa Batlló, who was in the year 2005 included a fund Unesco world heritage, can each visit.
In the first floor houses are the most spacious and most spectacular apartment zpřístupněn the public.
Owners of such a move ruled as many as 2002, on the occasion of celebration hundred 50th anniversary of the birth of a famous designer.
At the screening were left because they found that this is a highly profitable company and then expanded search for a common and garret room, with roof terraces.
Admission charge to the memory is definitely not insignificant, is 16,50 euros and students, retirees, and holders of tourist receipts have 20-percent reductions.
Total greatly exceeds the price of admission charge to other Gaudího structures in the city.
If you want to taste the atmosphere of a house with dragon věžičkami, you must fast friends with some of the people in the apartment house and visit it straight at home.
How to choose a mattress and grate. women have different requirements than mr
Rather than spectacular framework of bed, but the quality of lehací area, a mattress and grate, giving foundation really good beds.
It must, of course, harmoniously add to suit specific user.
At the election decided by many things, from the weight, height, age, health and gender of the owner.
It is also the kind of interior, a mattress and grate take for themselves.
A typical example?
Perhaps at víkendové the cottages, where he regularly did not stoke, are not suitable latexové mattress, the more slowly because " they heat up."
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than normal polyuretanová mattress.
At the same time is needed is to regularly draw.
If they do not have much odvzdušňovacích channels in the heart, and still rests on solid panel, they kept wateriness. Could the below them identify and blight.
In the choice is deciding the way.
Who spent a long time abroad, where often used very high with mattresses změkčující by layer, it is difficult to feel good about low and with a hard surface.
"Perhaps the ice hockey player who returned from NHL, i am complaining that nevyspí."
"At otlučená shoulders, hips heel and needed a mattress, změkčující a layer of lazy foams."
"These are needed and recommended for people with diabetes who have the disorder of the nervous system, so badly they assume, information" from the joints, skin," explains Hadamcziková Sylva, at čalouněný furniture specializes.
Many hockey players, but also other customers so years ago for a mattress with a lazy foam looked on.
"Now it is in wellbeing, the mattress is needed Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropico."
You do not have to be a winner from the NHL to pay tribute to lazy foam.
This "miracle" works ."
Optimizes rigidity and shape according to absorbovaného heat or will be forwarded to your warm person.
Nothing you do not push it at night you can not overturn it after heavy fighting.
It is better vyspíte.
Lazy foam works and as protection against proleženinami.
In the choice of the size of the mattress to add height and length of sole, which is around 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women with a height by 180 cm bed so he needs of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be dvoulůžka 90 cm, put together a 180 cm.
In separate beds, such as singlistů, is recommended at least to 120 to 140 cm.
For comfort and maybe a visit.
"Otherwise it is standard for the breadth of bed simple: at the camp on zádech they should have their hands comfortably slightly pokrčené in lokti," advises Ing. Prokopová Helena, cechmistryně corporation čalouníků and dekoratérů the problems sleeping and healthy ergonomie furniture makes it impossible for many years and lectures him on vocational schools.
At dvoulůžka needs of each own a grate and mattress, but there consideration when buying to reconcile heights of mattress.
Otherwise nezbude nothing more than to call grates to different heights, this is you, however, with every frame of bed may not succeed.
Pěnové mattress should have a height of at least 14 cm, with rates pružinovou the skeleton at least 15, from at least three centimeters counted in tvarovací and kypřicí the layer.
"At the touch of a hand or dosednutí on a mattress, you are not allowed to feel springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grate.
Celočalouněná bed when the mattress and the base has grown up as Siamese twins, they do not have in the bedrooms.
Mattresses, poorly ventilate it is impossible to wash their cover, which already is normal.
And as for the night usually vypotíme 0,2 to 0,75 l perspiration, it is clear that after five to seven years of mattress will start to resemble one big (and congested) sifter.
And that is why experts reject advertizing slogans about the life of mattress to 25 years, and even lifetime guarantee.
Everything, however.
And that is why proposal from the practice of sales. at the mattress is spreading of 120 or 140 cm hygiene and work detachable/recordable coating do not give up, but add more matracový a fender that you can easily go and wash.
Although today typically generate covers the mattress with zippers across the constituency, so after rozepnutí we will get two parts (for preparing and the size of a washing machine important!), but could manipulate at greater rates (and one man) at taking out reminiscent of light weights in the ring with heavy.
You are in bed instead of a grate firm panel?
Never!
No more than a bed for visits per night.
Panel, however, opatřete (if it does not have) airing opening and used mattress with pružinovou the skeleton and a height of at least 15 cm with the springs in the bags (from him. Taschenfederkern) and kypřicí by layer.
Polyuretanová mattress on this basis do not see it.
On nepolohovací lamelové the grates with 14 to 18 lamellas are appropriate latexové mattress or sandwich (perhaps a combination of latex and coconut) but always, you will pay grates with a larger number of lamellas, 28 or more, with its lamella on shoulders and twin is their rigidity might be regulated.
On polohovací lamelové the grates do not see the mattress with pružinovou the skeleton, because polohování they do not respond.
In addition to the deployment of the rigidity of lamellas can be desired and so-called cradle shoulders.
It is about a particular level of lamellas that makes it possible to push down or even to hang its lamella so that the shoulders of sleeper much " buried."
For a man who has the " shoulders across the entire back" definitely important thing.
Even remember him back and a mattress manufacturers who in " gentleman's" began to use změkčující zone just over shoulders.
Women also recall - to those once again they want softens surface in places kyčlí.
For the most demanding clients are designed křidélkové or destičkové the grates with so-called multitorzním suspension.
Pressure is growing to more points and is decreasing tensions.
Of course, once you will be used on the right mattress and pillow grate bad (large, " naducaný"), most " plus" will go away.
The basic rule is simple: pillow has podepírat head and peaks to intervene only on the shoulders, to allow shoulders relax muscles.
Fit sizes are recommending a to 50 X 60 cm they prefer such as Scandinavia.
At the camp on the shoulder would have a pillow to rise (along with shoulders birthplace of grate or změkčenou the area in the mattress) and shoulders.
Modern mattress they have with the original pallets plněnými a wet prairies after all, something in common.
Their producers, are increasingly using natural materials or at least příměsi.
The trend is simply and at the bio mattress.
Raw materials from oil, from which they are made polyuretanové foams, are replaced with natural oils, such as skočce and soya.
Just sóju used to be all well-known manufacturers.
"Bio on a mattress means that the substance is made from the material purely natural resource," explains peter Vašíček from the society of Tropico plus.
Natural ingredients are used in the production of covers the mattress, one of the first was aloe vera vera.
But to wish you can and mikrokapsle that you unleash fresh scents of forest or lavender.
There are also divisions between men and women.
While the " refreshes" plant extract from the birch that the mattress cover of experienced heat and cooling the body, women in contrast, covers " stoke."
Extract from red papriček boost the circulation of the blood, so it is the weaker sex tepleji.
Today's favorité?
Mattresses made from cold (foams has more leeks with porušenou cellular structure is so prodyšnější than the usual polyurethane and offers and better elasticitu.
A combination of rigidity, foams and " lazy" foams arise vícezónové the mattress which are the ones who know where it is to be head, shoulders and stalemate.
For a good mattress you will be paying and seven thousand crowns and higher.
Those who meet health parameters, they have lower VAT rate, is taken as medical aid.
As the first happened in the Czech Republic on this benefit Gumotex.
To save on a mattress and grate is not easy.
Sometimes it can be applied to the actions of the producers or the dealers that offer two mattresses for the price of one.
Perhaps brand is offering Magniflex mattress Duofreeze, všitou paměťovou the foam Memory to cover for 11 of the 990 crowns.
Second, it is possible, of course, has to go free.
The era of lazy or viskoelastických foams with open cellular structure and high - density fired " space" movement material Tempur.
Originally created as material for NASA because it starts at the astronauts were exposed to massive congestion.
Tempur in many měkne, in turn, increases in the cold.
Warm human body is so perfectly to present and expanding its optimum pressure.
So it is ideal for creating proleženin, but also for increasing comfort with sleeping.
Viskoelastické foams are used not just to the mattresses, but also of medical products, special needs on pillows under the feet, legs and ease venous system.
Domestic producers used for example, foam Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and the like.
Tools to monitor people want more and more parents want to watch kids
Fears about their child brings more people to the idea of guarding via GPS.
The system was originally developed for an investigation after the cars can they follow and the movement of people and thereby help needed in such cases, what is the disappearance 9-year-old Aničky Janatkové.
The equipment is great about as boxes from the reconciles, soon but can be just as great hours.
A lot of people terrified case zmizelé Aničky and start pídit along the way children are better protected.
And for the price of a breach of their privacy.
"We try everything to say that this is not about any špehování, but an additional funds to reduce the likelihood that it will be a tragedy," says peter Pilin from a Macro Weil, one of the contractors sledovacích of devices to the Czech market.
"I admit that in certain cases could reach into the abuse of such a device, possibly when they get to the tile to someone who does not know about that, but we are still in that case they did not meet."
"Mostly it truly customers are buying for security reasons," added sawdusts.
According to him, always a child should know, serves to what purpose " box" and how it is being used in an emergency.
Children's psycholožka Dan Bočková warns that if the child does not want anything similar to wear, quite simply, this will shed.
"Even very young children show great creativity in how some things schválně to lose when they do not want to be in control."
"Great expectations caused when parents before mobile phones, but who can switch as it sledovací equipment," says Bočková.
According to her, it is also questionable whether in the event of an attack such devices really helped.
"In terms of preparing gotten the kidnapping, will ensure perpetrators in practice always ensure that when the child did not have any electronics, which could reveal its location."
"Now it is the phone."
"When they are starting to expand sledovací facilities, will be looking for once is because their sales will certainly support the massive advertizing."
"In that case will be criminals always one step ahead before the police," says psycholožka.
However, he admits that such devices can help in case an unexpected challenge a paedophile.
The audit, which offers sledovací services as for cars and for the people, and when it comes after the attack to instant destruction sledovacího of equipment, his presence could help, according to Robert Čech from society RC.
"The device can be set at periodic sending situation following the expiration of certain time."
"If it hurt, will be available for at least the last state of the relevant people."
"The more expensive devices has zabudované and náklonometry, so even if someone just slipped and stayed still to lie, will send the facility immediately warning to the indictment of the situation," he says of the Czech Republic.
According to him, similar services could distract and smart mobile phones, navigation, which is enough to record and special software.
The problem of current sledovacích units is that they oppose the machines similar to their counterparts of the size of the box from reconciles or less mobile phones.
Always threatens their loss.
According to sawdust from a Macro Weil is therefore now testing equipment vypadající as ordinary digital watch.
"It will have the greatest advantage in that it expected an aggressor do not have sledovací equipment at all to know."
"Or it will see right through some time and this can give police time to boot," it adds.
Already, sledovací equipment will develop into the bracelets or counterparts, will always use the same technology, which is used for guarding cars.
The combination of detected in the situation via GPS (using ordinary autonavigace) and a mobile phone which current position as coaches reports.
The army has a fiery strings that obmotaly the Czech Republic. But it will last only two years ago
The Czech army bought 445 miles of the strings which broke out explosives.
Last year, at the same time, the defence Ministry added to the stores 224 miles of strings.
The military so have the reserves to 225 years.
The problem is that the durability of strings are two, no more than four years.
The army bought the fiery strings from share STV Group. s. for 40 million crowns.
The general staff in the rationale for buying a huge amount of fiery strings of the forefront of Today's youngsters answered that soldiers are trained to spend 60 miles zápalnic a year.
Calculations from the army pyrotechnists that the forefront of Today's Youth approached, however, show that the pyrotechnical very intense training they had each year to go through and all the generals and officers of command of the army, secretaries or charwomen.
The defence minister Alexander Vondru and chief of staff Vlastimila Picka included.
Only then could be justified annual consumption by an army of sixty miles zápalnic.
The length is appropriate to 25 thousand explosions.
Even if this is the case, it would be the supply of staff would be enough for more than a decade.
If the reverse was true that in basic training every new professional enough nanejvýše two metres fiery strings, say experts, then the army has secured a fresh acquisition - with increased consumption of sapper or special forces - accompanied at the age of of 225.
The soldiers of volunteerism rapid deployment, at the same time, ministers Vondrovi personally complained recently that do not have almost no cartridges to hand guns, so they are and burning because of the need for money.
At the lack of mention undergarment.
"I am also a leader does not take that of us buy repeatedly such a large amount zápalnic."
"But is their decision, and surely they know what they will be."
"For us, the army of good client to whom, as traders trying to meet," says marketing manager STV Group Jan Děcký.
A spokesman for the department of Defense Jan Pejšek justify it hundreds of miles nakupované of string and what the army will have the reserves of the "bombs" at least a decade.
Jan Děcký from STV Group, however, only talking about four-year life zápalnice and police or army pyrotechnists yet only about two years.
"At a store that may be, these four," says one of them, as the soldier because of his criticism of the army does not want to take the title.
After a period of life must carefully every ordnance test of whether there is a credible and does not threaten to soldiers for life.
But these tests are not free and cost more money.
Another argument of many department is down to 445 km fiery strings.
"It has cost us about sixty percent less than last year's supply of two hundred kilometers čtyřiačtyřiceti," interprets the spokesman Pejšek view the buyers of the department of Defense.
Only by comparison. annual consumption shooting strings police pyrotechnists who dispose of bombs from World War II or the after the Soviet army, do not exceed for several years, 1 of the 500 metres.
And the police always just that so many of these bombs made before the expiry of his life.
It was discovered because of the safety of pyrotechnists, and may in addition, more flexibly get more modern and, therefore, more reliable types of strings.
The department of Defense already have significant difficulties with the disposal of tens of thousands of tons of munitions from the time the Warsaw Pact, when dvousettisícová Czechoslovakian troops preparing to the campaign in the Rhine.
The Czech according to the pyrotechnists that the forefront of Today's Youth, she is waiting for a few years, the same problem: it will dispose of hundreds of kilometres of old zápalnic today by " cheap" shops.
So far, I draw on the contacts, which thanks to the competition I got
A place in the competition the tradesman of the year helped Lukas Pytlounovi to sell franšízy to his hotel.
The winner last year for a competition of the tradesman year became 28-year-old businessman Lukas Pytloun from Liberce.

The most comfortable of them was until recently čtyřhvězdičkový Pytloun design hotel.

"It is not that much just my personal achievement, it is a good job we all put together."
"Just my name is putting out to the top," he says modestly Lukas today Pytloun.
I wish the successor to calmer year than we have had in Farmetu
The euphoria of victory quickly, the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the fortitude of winners, however, has Farmet bad times for themselves.
For the price of a first in last year's competition Vodafone year the company last year in Slavic house there was an owner of the company Farmet, charles Žďárský.
Jury at the time, praised the effort through which they built from a small nástrojářské workshops in Czech vitriol company has stamilionovými a turnover.
"I can say that praise has encouraged not only me, but all of my co-workers and increased us self-confidence to fight the competition," she says today of last year's winners.
At the start of the history of the company Farmet was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state has offered the father, charles Žďárského to the occupancy of small dílničku as a substitute for the Communist seizures of property, long time she did not hesitate, rejected a career in the company, which at that time was working, and with few friends about his daddy they founded a company plastové the van.
Shortly afterwards they were beginning to specialize is pressing for a vegetable oil.
Eighteen years after learning from them has become the largest producer of forces in Central Europe.
Greater awareness and unprofessional public, the company received after achieved success in the competition through the media.
"Not only are our customers have started to see signs Farmet significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they are working with the company that made the country more success," says charles Žďárský.
Last year, however, was not in Farmetu only marked by the euphoria of vítězsví.
Assessment was based on the results of the company to 2008 and only partially of of 2009.
And just of 2009 was the most difficult year for engineering the sale goods.
The crisis culminated, which so far has not yet hit civilians, but the company has stalled investment projects and began to restrict purchases of new machinery and technology.
"This situation clearly did not avoid or us. the"
"Revenue decreased by 40 percent, they had to cut production and came to the release," explains charles Žďárský.
Viable company must have known on occasion to do and so unpopular measures.
The situation but they controlled and society we maintain a profit, although lower than before the crisis.
What, in Farmetu they have not forgiven, it is investing in research and development.
"From the subsidies, we have built a research and training centre, we have strengthened presentation on international trade fairs, have a major appreciation in domestic expositions," says Žďárský.
All this suggests that the crisis is behind them.
Revenue is growing again, and with them and the number of new employees.
"A new winner I want a nice feeling from the victory, but in calmer atmosphere," karl is sending Žďárský.
The inquiry, by removing pointless legislation
Inquiry about the absurdity of the year for the fourth time part of the business tournament.
Some pointless legislation has already managed to lift.
The infamous champion another year of inquiry the absurdity of the year was obliged to wear to the office documents and officials - available online.
Deciding that more than a third of less than four thousand who voted.
For example, the administration ordered the Social Security act report from the registration of the company, while civil servant he can win two clickings of a mouse.
That will change as a result of the inquiry.
"The Czech leadership of Social Security is already a report from the registration of the company at the controls when the contributors of insurance to order will not be," said the spokesman ČSSZ Jan Buraňová.
To be radiated to all the rules and regulations imposed on companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic, and those foolhardy to repeal it is the spirit of competition the absurdity of the year.
That is the year for the fourth time on the part of the business pořádaného tournament, newspapers and amongst the public enjoys growing popularity.
If the past year from voting accounted for three of thousands who voted, this year already them were almost four thousand.
And it is no wonder, all the different legal obligations that serves only to protraction of business is with us still in abundance.
"The number of flyers for the beliefs that we are at the top of the world," notes to the charles Havlíček from the association of small and medium enterprises and businesses in the Czech Republic.
Simplifying business in recent years become proklamovaným the goal of all governments.
But in the Czech Republic the situation particularly does not improve, compared with the world.
According to the World bank, the Czech Republic, in terms of conditions for businesses placed at 74. position that is against eight times worse than last year.

Leaders sent a businessman and professional associations and journalists.
" Among the finalists' competition, and among nominovanými left for example, the demand for the cars for the maintenance of the highway and high-speed roads pay tolls, or entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and painted two toilets every two years.
The list of this year's seven of the proposals is published on the website of competition.
The publication of the competition that is always been the start of the autumn at Václavském the square in Prague, are part of hapenningu who regularly attend the personalities of political and social life.
This year, for example, at the culmination of a competition assisted Eva Svobodová, director of the association of small and medium enterprises and businesses in the Czech Republic or peter Kužel, president Hospodářské the chambers of the Czech Republic.
"Economic prosperity can function where the cast to entrepreneurs sticks from under foot, so it is my goal lifted every year at least three dozen paragraphs, which today is unnecessarily complicated business," said the Minister of Trade and Industry, Martin Kocourek.
Attempts to abolish the senseless order does not end up naprázdno.
As 2007 people to the most mattered obligations for entrepreneurs to announce three days ahead trade office in a place where there is hosting a permanent workroom, his intention to run with the booth at the exhibition or wake.
This duty was lifted by the amendment trade law.
The second - most hlasovaná toll of 2007, which was nahlášení employment office for an official foreign trip in the range of up to 30 days, was removed by the law on so-called green card.
And třetice all good.
The absurdity of of 2009 became the physiotherapists to have the consulting room, a large mirror, fridges and two land mass.
That was the year the announcement of the department of Health easing - bound to have revolted fridge.

On land fund in Plzen, the police arrested in the tender
In the building land fund in Plzen in recent days, the anti-corruption police.
Blades detectives met local businessman in the media sphere and businessman with the realities Luboši G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the ongoing tender to settle recovery requirements so that his land has offered in the competition attracted particular interested party.
It was for this Luboši G. to pay half - a - million crowns.
"I can only confirm that the police prosecute a man for the offence of putsch in a public contract and tender," said boss right of the Plzen national representation Antonie green with what other details in light of the ongoing investigation, it is impossible to say.
46-year-old Entrepreneur police officers after 24 hours set free.
On how to tender influence, could be given a minimum of official information only to speculate.
The speaker of land fund Lubomíra black on the question of justice said that police officers really separated arrested at work in Plzen, and during the competition.
"This was a client, not our employees," set.
Tender, according to black good name " call to announce the offering of demands for the transfer of land under the law of the land" and is being held in the event that a coup offered the land is proving take a more legitimate applicants.
"These people within the challenge they offer superior value of renewing claims to be a transfer deal was vyhlašovaná the value of his land."
"According to nabídnutých calls for the regulation of acquirers and landed the fund will then transfer coup of land to the person who offered high demands," explained spokesman for the fund.
Luboš G. had apparently information who took the call sign up, and because it is also approved person, because buying up a range of renewed demands, offered to applicants against the coup of land that will not participate in the competition.
For this probably inkasoval severance pay.
That would explain that he had at the detention such a large sum of money.
Luboš G. had links to above-standard PF in Plzen been in the past.
In the case of the former boss of PF Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for having published in restitution for spare plots of land on which had already been issued a decision on the location of the structure.
It was then acquired Luboš G. from a fund such as land earmarked for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where he had to build příjezdová main line to industrial zones Borská of the field.
Later he is very advantageously changed with the municipality for a house in the historic city centre, who had a much higher value.
At the time, had approached at the town hall, or else by blocking of land structure under threat.
Households on the tower will contribute hundreds of monthly
Households will need of January to contribute not only to all sorts of energy, but also for a water rate and water bill, giving the heat and elsewhere will increase and leases.
Families will thus have to January to pull out of the pockets of up to hundreds of crowns per month more than now.
Electricity is expensive by up to 4,6 percent, the gas will be about 2 percent more expensive by up to desetinu in some cities, you will have to contribute to the delivery of water, and in many places it will also lay down the supply of central heating.
The more expensive electricity should households in the flats to build a year against the 100 crown posters dráž than now.
The cost of electricity silové at the same time, all the major suppliers reduced to blame is therefore a significant increase in support for generating energy from renewable sources, mostly fotovoltaiky.
Gas will raise costs slightly, but when people most stokes and has such high consumption.
Annually, then they must also count on hundreds of crowns.
While electricity and gas will raise the price of around the republic, changes in the price of central heating is different place from the spot.
Price increases planned mainly larger communities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kralove to pick up from january's for central heating to 50 crowns per month in addition, more than 1000 crowns a year will pay families in Liberci.
People in Prague once again threatens them by more than 9 percent will raise the price of water rates and water bill, even if the city will increase the rent from the infrastructure.
If the rent no changes will be made Pražené 6,8 percent.
In Prague, however, will still see in celorepublikovém a comparison between lower.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where it is already the prices are among the highest, has a water rate and water bill to lay down by 7,4 percent.
Significantly, for example, the increase in the price of rent at 450 thousand residential apartments, where January ends up legislation.
For example, the company CPI apartments in Usti nad Labem own about 2500 apartments, going from january's rent increase of up to one hundred percent.
Those who will not be with new level of rental to agree, is keen to give the company to court.
Regulated by leases that would pay the people in about 300 of thousands of apartments, next year could rise by up to ten percent.
Czech children are drinking a Phernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, working slowly
Phernet, rum, vodka, uniquely and better label whisky ukradená parents.
These are drinking, after which vypití ends up most frequently in the care of doctors a drunkard, who has not even been fifteen years.
The exception is no children, from an ape is treated in the hospital again.
Results from the experience of the doctors who, with similar cases they meet at the revenue department of children's hospitals.
"Some beer or wine are completely out of fashion, as long it takes before you can intoxicate."
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol," said right to the head doctor department of children's hospital Hořovice in Central Bohemia Luděk pelican.
"When they manage to pull bottle father out of the cupboard, so it is going to be whisky, but otherwise there is Phernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage that they pour into the juice and it is not, then so much to do," explained lead doctor.
And for the fact it gives a spokesman for teaching hospital Motol Eva Jurinová.
"For most it is often Phernet or rum."
"It is now a modern alcohol, particularly in primary schools."
"In some cases it was slivovici that had been brought from home," said Jurinová.
According to the lead doctor of pelican is thirteen or 14-year-old drinkers at a hospital income fairly commonplace.
Before Hořovicemi, where it raises from this year, he worked for a decade on pediatrii in Motole, where ambulances carrying podroušené školáky from wide outside.
"One girl lay with us about four times."
"Career started in twelve years, when it has brought us to 3,5 per thousand blood alcohol in addition, combined with ecstasy, described the doctor" particularly serious case.
"He was on a fairground in Holešovicích on some taneční groups."
"Interestingly, her mother has not appeared odd that the clock did not know about her daughter of 48," has surprised head doctor.
It was the indifference of parents or even their considerable tolerance of popíjení own offspring tend to be seen as the main reason for the growing child pijanství.
In the true sense of the word, according to experts in children to talk will not give the addiction.
"Beneath the idea of alcohol is understood several years of chronic alcohol dependence, with all signs that the náležejí, and that in children is not."
"For those that alcohol use repeatedly, is more characteristic not perform rodinně-social background," explained lead doctor pelican.
According to a spokesman Jurinové this year to pediatrické a clinic in Motole are hospitalized by the middle of November around forty drunk children.
The statistics, however, they will only achieve those with heavy intoxikací, which was in a hospital stay.
The child, who are drunkards for outpatient treatment they found parents or are home to transport police, is by no means does not count.
Aside from cases when children just sit at the school and they will drink up a bottle of liquor, exist in the pelican three seasonal fluctuations, you can count on: čarodějnice, Sylvester and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink was from bad certificate, or have hailed the beginning of the holidays."
"Obviously čarodějnice I saw at the reception and drunkards seven children together," said pelican.
A drunkard who will spend the night detoxikací under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, is in favour, as compared to the one the next day at home will suffer a painful hangover.
Morning of head pain caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose he would go away zavodňovací infuze with glucose and nutrients that the organism are missing.
"Is this actually better, as they have after this beautiful evening experience and a good wake-up and nothing is do not hurt."
"They are just uproar from where they are," admitted pelican with the occasional will infect patients pleasant mood at least a list of costs that have instructed their treatment.
An ambulance transport and hospitalization for acute bed he will come out and tens of thousands of crowns.
"At times, I have applied as educational resources, while I am directly to those children then the doctors round calculated how much their rage would cost and what they could also spend the entire summer to voluntary work to earn that one party," added pelican.
Health insurance companies but according to him to sanction proceedings, in which parents claimed for the costs for treatment, they do not reach out in cases of child drunkards.
Two planes are L-159 for the first time in foreign hands in Spain
Two planes L-159 out of a total of five pieces for which the Czech defence Ministry has replaced the airliner Casa C-295M, on Tuesday flew out to the Spanish Sevilly, where sit the manufacturer of the plane - EADS Casa.
It is the first time that the machine of the type they found in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
Abroad, they were only on the practices or předváděcích years.
It is a two-seat version L-159T1, which has so far operated by the Czech army, which has letuschopné.
The remaining three machines are single-seat L-159.
These meanwhile, stands zakonzervované in Aeru Vodochody and the facilitator of trade - Omnipol company - is over whether last week.
When the plane physically dispatches from Vodochod is not according to Jan Pejšk from the ministry of defence has yet known.
"Single-seat aircraft L-159 for the exchange had been earmarked for the long - term imposed on the plane, without additional deposits and investments made by the department of treasury."
"The two-seat L-159T1 were směněny in the current situation and form," said right Pejšek.
Added that the army without a two-seat aircraft will not stay because ministry in the 2009 signed with Aerem Vodochody contract worth of 200 million crowns on the rebuilding of four unnecessary machines L-159 to two two-seat aircraft.
One new aircraft seized in the army, the other will assume by the end of this year.
According to Pejška, EADS pledged that the aircraft will advance to the arming some allied countries.
"In the treaty has stated clearly that the consumer of the aircraft is L-159 company EADS and will serve to train pilots from NATO."
"It is a matter of customers how it will realise," said Pejšek.
The newspaper some time ago he said that for instance. the Spanish army of L-159 has no interest.
The exchange of five L-159 for one Casa planes and buying three more planes for 3,5 billion crowns last year approved government of Mirek Topolánek.
The department of Defense nevypsalo to buy tender and looked downright EADS.
By the time the leadership of defence revealed that, in exchange will encourage future export L-159 abroad.
The Czech army from Aera buy 72 aircraft and would use only 24, others would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa planes will probably rule of finishing the game.
The European Commission, the Czech defence Ministry prosecuted in the European Court because he had a plane to pick out on the basis of a fine and not the focus of one manufacturer.
The army has seized three planes Casa, the last would have at Prague airport Kbely to fly in during the fortnight.
More than prsteníček forefinger reveals a lower risk of cancer
Men who have a forefinger longer than prsteníček, face fewer risks diagnosed with the cancer of the prostate.
That is the surprising conclusion of the study, which on Wednesday released the British journal of cancer.
It may be related to the surface of male hormone testosteronu.
"Our results indicate that the length of the finger can serve as a simple test of the risks of cancers of the prostate, especially for men to 60 years," said co-author of the study Eelesová dew, a professor of the institute for research on cancer at the university of Warwicku.
Finger so could help to determine that men should undergo tests for cancer of the prostate, particularly in combination with genetic risk ohrožujícími or other factors, such as family health burden, added Eelesová.
In the period 1994-2009 followed with a colleague in Britain, more than 1500 patients with cancer of the prostate and simultaneously over three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had forefinger on the right arm shorter than prsteníček.
Pay for them the same likelihood of cancer of the prostate for 19 percent of those whose fingers were just as long.
In the case of those who had forefinger longer than prsteníček, however, this risk has fallen by 33 percent, for men to 60th birthday has fallen even 87 percent.
The relationship between the duration of the two aforementioned fingers - featured in prenatal period - probably reflect varying levels of sexual hormones, which is the child suffered in the uterus.
Less testosteronu is responsible for longer forefinger.
Previous research has shown that testosteron support the growing of prostate cancer.
Prominent Czech genetics and former president of the Academy of sciences professor Vaclav Pačes for ČTK said she knows about this study zběžně, but it does not look like it is said that the relationship between the duration of fingers and cancer was " very good."

Cartridges can be programme so that they will explode not just in effect to the target, but at any point ballistic routes.
They can then be used against an enemy who is hiding behind a barrier, on walls or in a trench.
From above, usually protected is not, although it will suffer homicidal rain steel fragments, they can put out this service from the fight.
According to Richard Audett involved in the development of XM-25 is a new rifle the first weapon for the infantry who use " smart" technology.
"A soldier with it basically goes so he can find a target, will send its laser beam to determine the distance, they will get upřesněný deliberate show, according to him to adapt náměr and will squeeze tap."
"Let us say you have measured 543 metres away."
"If you print destruction, a gun is loaded, and will kick-start bullet at a distance of of 543 metres plus minus one, two or three metres," said Audette.
It will move 400 posts
Fujitsu is about to move from a branch of Bad Homburgu to Frankfurt.
400 staff transferred job in the next year from providing public building on the Marienbader- square in Bad Homburgu to the aster of the park.
Japan's Fujitsu this sector will move from Bad Homburgu to Frankfurt.
How, on Wednesday reported giant in the field, which is dedicated to the computers and maintenance, moving in next year's of 400 men and women jobs from provide public building on the Marienbader- square in Bad Homburgu to the aster of the park, which is a large complex in administrative Lyonské the street, in part called the Niederrad Frankfurt.
According to the spokesman, Fujistu where he was shortly to move even further 100 jobs of concern that have been divided for the region.
The supply of rental have been told it is very attractive and large-space offices in the aster of park said it is more suits working the way it works.
Also in Bad Homburgu Fujitsu was only in the lease.
A competent agent Bernd Wagner said, "for Frankfurtu-Niederrad we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure."
Excellent connections to the airport is just for global companies such as Fujitsu is very important.
Recent moving important business in the region has caused yesterday's joy at the winners and losers disappointment at.
The leading economic reporter in Frankfurt Markus the franc (CDU) said that it managed to gain a " global player."
It said it is " fantastic show of faith in this location."
Fujitsu has said it is cast into the city, usídlení is an important boost for Niederrad.
Bad Homburgu mayor, Michael Korwisi (Zelení), Fujitsu regretted the decision.
The city has said it is timely information on the boards of companies about its purpose.
"Of course the society we have offered our assistance," said Korwisi.
Friendly ties but could not change the complexity of the manufacturers of computers with the renter of the property on the Marienbader- square.
The result was a decisive economic reasons.
Now it is this in order to avoid a lengthy vacation so prominently.
"I hope it will be the owner and the renter of the building cooperative."
A house on the Rathaus- square, which so far has used Fujitsu, and nearby "Kleine Vertikale" to see a decade ago, along with other buildings on the square to Marienbader- most discussed a constructive purpose of spa.
Between the station and the town hall was founded as a joint project of the city and private designer of the so-called urban entree, who was criticised by both because of the massive zástavbě of areas that had previously served as car park while also because of the height of buildings.
At 2001, moved into the home in the company's investment advice and rating Feri, the producer of software for the travel distribution systems, opened Amadeus, as well as a manufacturer Fujitsu computer, which was at the time were still associated with Siemens.
The buildings, which use Fujitsu, received 2006 voice, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley real Estate Fund and a year after it was sold to Spanish Falcon real Estate Investment SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu- concern from Tokia is described as the third - largest IT-provider in the world.
An offer for example, the developers of computers and servers in hand and old, also an essential service.
A branch of the Rhine and Mohanu is one of the largest in Germany, most employees Fujitsu, but in Munich.
From Bad Homburgu is moving to Frankfurtu-Niederrad subsidiary of technologists Fujitsu Solutions, another subsidiary in this location will be Fujitsu Services and company called TDS.
In a public building aster park, pronajalo for this purpose of of 7000 square meters.
In the complex - its title highlights hvězdicový the coup, which is two years old, sits among other things, the central union electro-technical and electronic industries.

" Free speech in a country free" he told the activists of publishing a short news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before that, Amazon web company documents Wikileaks from servers.
Internet activists used in the disclosure of secret diplomatic dispatch by Amazon Web Services (AWS), so that they could control large number of approaches to the documents.
Through service Twitter Wikileaks to explain the move: "Fine - our dollars we spend by employ people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of speech, "then they should stop selling books."

Wikileaks spokesman, Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said that scored and threats.
"Once there were calls for the murder of Julian Assange."
As a result, Assange has rightly concerned about security, said Hrafnsson.
It will be the founder of Wikileaks, continue to hide.
Apparently, Hrafnsson responded to statements from North America.
In America, asked the former Republican governor of Arkansasu, Mike Huckabee, to be responsible for the publication on Wikileaks as a betrayal charged and executed.
In Canada, said on television one adviser to the head minister Stephen Harper - perhaps ironically, Assange should be " slaughtered" and Obama could use " target aircraft."
Meanwhile, took place between the White House and the Assange said.
A spokesman of the us president, barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, has called it " ridiculous and absurd" that Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton whether she is responsible for spying recently published an invitation diplomats.
"I am not quite sure why we are interested in the opinion of one person with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are having far more significant than websites."
The American government is now extensively investigated by security databanek.
Special commissioner has been appointed a deputy director of the center for antiteroristická the measure, Russell Travers, informed the White House.

"We have done everything to do with them came into contact," said a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to shelter, if it were needed."
The university Zmrzlinová
"Gelato at the university" for Boloně prepare zmrzlinoví to confectioner for better times of the year.
On the basic rate for future zmrzlináře that the last three days, is highly interested and visitors come from all over the world.
Where did in fact it takes the ice cream?
From Gelatiere and from Gelataio.
Gelatiere, Czech slightly obsoletely zmrzlinář, produces cream seems to have rules zmrzlinářského Italian art.
Gelataio going to vomit a palette knife ice cream from chladícího the box, to mop it into the wafer and will sell.
To find out, you do not have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to learn more about ice cream, this will not avoid "Gelato- universities" Carpigiani Italian companies.
During 2003, raised the zmrzlinových makers of machinery zmrzlinovou university to ice cream from its machines matched everywhere senior Italian ideals.
On the basic rate for future Gelatieri that the last three days, is huge interest and visitors come from all over the world.
But it is also offered a several-day special courses on the čokoládové ice cream and practice in their own zmrzlinárně.
One longs in Midlife-Crisis for new careers, but others will risk on thin ice with a vague tužeb.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents - from Brazil via Hungary after Saudi Arabia.
Jack, a teacher of art from California, love Slow-Food movement and would want to continue to offer quality of the product of the country's industrial Ice-Cream.
Anke from Berlin, konzultantka and would have wanted after years strávených stressful job to start something of their own.
Two young Egypťanky will eat up about what to Kairu will open zmrzlinárnu.
One man from malta and one of brazil's they want to improve the quality of ice cream in bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia came as his children love Italian ice cream.
Luciano Maestro-Gelatiere Ferrari initially will explain to the participants ideal property perfect ice cream.
It is crucial not just good taste, but also hebkost silk and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during training on southerner and patriotic cherry on the cake. "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then this is a good dose of the romantics."
The first step of production seems pretty simple.
Luciano will place the basic ingredients milk and whipped cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers to big of a blender that all will heat up the electronic programme to 85 degrees and then immediately will strengthen to four degrees.
Then winds on the machine on tap and leads out pasterizovaný white basic cream, foundation of all types of milk icecreams.
Now it is a docent bespatter issues: It is possible to make ice cream just from natural substances without the stabilizer?
How can a person her experiment?
Luciano points out, to be hijacked by the spirit of time to far away.
He speaks of the ice cream "only from natural ingredients," apparently just used stabilisers - mostly natural product, such as guarová flour from guarových the granules.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream and without stabilisers, but must be sold in one day, otherwise it will be shrunk and customer him very much ice granules.
Some variation of basic material is holidays.
More exciting to be with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano is different in flavour of the ice cream according to the additives that they buy in the supermarket be in the division with fruit or in the department of sweets.
In addition, there are powders and creams.
"Contractors are you going to try to impose a lot of aromatic ingredients."
"You ought but simply to experiment."
Be with fruit sorbety with the sugar and fresh fruit.
Or the white ice cream from the basic material that will change with eggs on yellow cream and cocoa to the foundation for všelijaká čokoládová the temptation.
Now it is not participating, of course, zmrzlinovým machines.
Luciano are going to let them do always four different types vanilkové, čokoládové, kávové and lískooříškové icecreams - are with the eggs or without them in the basic material, with more or less vanilkovým the properties or other natural ingredients.
The experiment will take place and with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic ingredients, more fruit pyré - given a flavour that is not always better.
Lískooříšková ice cream may not taste more oříšková that contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular ice cream from a kiwi will make the group, which will use more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when a balanced mix of highlights, Gelato tastes, says Luciano.
Production of ice cream is purely the role. If it is used broskvové pyré with much sugar, have reduced the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe.
In lemon icecreams needs especially the amount of sugar.
Luciano going to vomit an instrument that identifies the content of sugar in fruit (wine-growers the measures must aid from grapes).
Fortunately, the tables make it easier to figures.
Production of ice cream no longer require as much physical faces as before.
It does not help the only tool to automated production of basic material.
There is also a tool that will zmrzlinovou mixture while meddling in the cream and will strengthen in minus the temperature.
Despite all the automation we can not avoid minor accidents.
Gustavo Brazilan will be soiled and colleague odshora until the fruit pyré when it starts from the management giant blender.
"In each of course," believes Maestro Luciano, "it is just a matter of time when something like that happens."
Revisers in double light
The European food Efsa is linked to the industry that genetic experiments with businesses.
The accusations made by now a group of experts Testbiotech, which it considers the independent institute for an estimate of the effects of biotechnology.
"It sounds like confederate theory, but we have a well - documented," he said on Wednesday in Munich boss Christoph Testbiotechu Then.
A leading expert group Efsa for gentechnicky altered crops, Harry Kuiper, and other expert Efsa has for several years contract with the union lobistů Ilsi.
It is funded it as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper participated in a decisive way to control the Efsa for genetic businesses and are so obvious conflict of interest, Then criticizes.
The Efsa, he is said to share the whole paragraphs of the documents Ilsi and they do so the handwriting of an industry that should be controlled by the power of the Italian Parmě.
This is the second time that Testbiotech points to a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from Efsa without additions or intermediate time to Swiss agricultural concerns Syngenta - and changed sides.
Also, radio in central Germany (MDR) recently revealed personal involvement by the EU - office for checking with industry lobby, which raised the interest of both the department for the environment and members of the EU.
Meanwhile, the Efsa can not distinguish a conflict of interest.
He worked with all sound data, as well as those from industry, if they are highly professional quality, is shown in a statement.
Experts who work for the Efsa is not required not to have links with the industry.
It is however justified.
Kuiper admits working for the International Life Sciences institute (Ilsi) in the us.
It was described as a neutral forum of experts from the science, industry and politicians - apart from others for an estimate of the risk of biotechnology without a contract for a lobbyist.
Independent experts, Then criticize that are currently leave gentechnicky modified crops at the animals without any effort by feeds, and that is not tested the genetic businesses response to the effects of the environment.
"We want to know, for example, that will do gentechnicky modified maize in the field," says So.
Current practice is yet to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic company that does not justify reliable results.
"If you are not looking for risk, as it would then be possible to find? " he Then asks žalobně.
With this corresponds and Angelika Hilbeck.
Female worker examines gentechniku of 1994 and currently is working on the technical high school in Zurich.
Here is seeking industry as in the us, also now, more and more to influence or to discredit critical scientist.
That is why almost no scientists who were not associated with it.
Most are not published the study, which are for companies critical.
"Industry controls the security research," believes Hilbeck.
An indication of the stones
Uli Gsell is also some received a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday the evening came before the train station in Stuttgartu, one of zádech.
It was a demonstration.
Snowed.
The story is familiar with: September was the dredges and they began to remove the large portion of northern wing.
In Stuttgartu world were not the same: Thousands demonstrated against S21, a billion reduction in train stations.
Having reached the suspension of construction, lay most of the wing in the rubble.
Rozbité to 6000, 7000 pieces.
Calcite from Crailsheimu, soft rough stone that was used in both 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor, in Ostfildern 43 years.
Sure some of these pieces.
"These stones is a relic."
"It is never gone away."
Dissolves. " Cheap and poor stone, simple and aboriginal."
When a slit, stank after cigaretovém smoke.
What do with those pieces, yet unknown.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
Signs of stones from Stuttgartu led to the wood at Tübingen in the former deponii munitions French armies, where Manuel Rongen, stony empire.
44-year old man trades with the old stones.
Buying all, created during the demolition in Stuttgartu.
"It would be a shame if rozemlely on the gravel or disappeared in deponii," says in office, wooden booth that was previously guard little house.
Will know that they swore and threatened him when he stood for September in all the newspapers that bought the rest of the northern wing of the company that conducts demolition.
But he said the whole days with adversaries S-21.
And explained to them that he still can not for demolition.
And when it happens, it is still a wisest when the stones will continue to use them.
After taking 200 With-21-enemies every one of 80 kilograms of heavy block, price for a piece from of 6,50 to 14 euros.
As memory, some also in the hope that it will return to repeat the building.
Rongen bought 500 tonnes of cargo of 25 large trucks.
About half are still in the forest, other long since been sold.
The gardeners, regional gardener, constructors home.
They came from all corners and they withdrew it down in a suitcase and a trailer.
The cornerstones of dispute from Stuttgartu long ago have turned into been a " dwarf walls" or as the edges of beds with herbs.
"This stone in fact, there is nothing special," says Rongen.
"If he was not a political patches."
Being in the field, car and am going to projížďku after 20 hectare kingdom.
Studied ahead rights, education suspended, later to biology, was interested in computers and eventually became a businessman with stones.
And a lover of stones.
It included 40000 tonnes of stones.
Bears treasures from across Germany.
He says it is the largest merchant with the old stones in the republic.
Brakes.
The snow is artistically opracované the sandstones.
"Once they belonged to the Marien- bridge in Dresden" he will tell.
Sandstone from the Elbe, yellow, warm, enthusiastic.
" my most favorite stone."
We go further along the path up through the forest.
Displays a pile. red sandstone, before the side of the train station in Karlsruhe.
And next.
" Nice travertin."
One can see these blocks on the stand Neckarstadionu in Stuttgartu.
Everywhere in snow lies stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from police in Stuttgartu Presidium, red granit from the temple Sankt Blasien, tuf from a hospital in Heilbronnu.
What works, what, what perspiration.
When Rongen thinks about how it by hand before fallen stones and transported through simple tackles and bullish vehicles, it will become quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a thing crushed."
Do not become wealthy, very rich have not.
Businessman with stones today, but employs 14 people, with up in les organised the masons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, one glass-blower and a gardener.
"We are working hard, but it is satisfactory," says the person who has evaluated by others.
In the foreseeable future, to Cologne.
It will also save the stones.
The battle for talent against the potential of High-
At the snack-bar there are many people.
the 16 students are pressed at the canapes with salmon, rajčatové soup and sweets.
Technical university in Braunschweigu and car manufacturers Volkswagen invited students of engineering and design at the workshop.
Along with the developers of society VW here to talk about the car of the future - and only then, incidentally, to see Volkswagen.
Many companies attempt in the race is the most clever titles, as well as VW, a company to succeed and bets on the collaboration with universities.
Their mission is. As soon as possible to recruit in the lecture-halls the most talented graduates, even before they arrive in the job market, and they will be looking to others.
Since the university does not publish lists of any successful students, try companies to feature an exceptional talent in projects oriented to the practice and get it.
The Braunschweig car is about trying to get a talent the next day.
One young lady from personal department circulated propisky, Teddy and rubber panels with VW logo.
He will tell a promising young talent on the programs at practice, student work and give them the way for alarm.
Nico Selle from THE Braunschweig, " is a project jointly with VW.
It sees advantages for both sides: "Students come into contact with the industry and will gain experience."
"VW can also learn about students, closer to familiarise themselves with interesting candidates and think twice, who was thrown as a co-worker."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, it is not unusual.
But the news is what is so openly matches against the students.
"Otherwise, it was rather significant professional project," says Selle.
Fighting fresh graduates will be about even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer charge employees from the army of its competitors.
It must instead, try and try and attract particularly highly skilled workforce.
Above all, the graduates engineering disciplines have excellent bargaining position.
According to data from the association of German engineers VDI remained in the annulled 40.000 engineering positions.
And according to forecasts VDI " shortage of train drivers has yet to rise.
For auditing and consulting firm KPMG is Roman Dykta on the persecution of talent.
Organise a challenging Recruiting-events, for example. KPMG-Race, the kind of modern race to the treasure, in which participants must find a way to koordinát GPS.
The company plans next year to send in this way, eight promising students after the us.
Participants can also view the industry and KPMG familiarise themselves with the company.
Prior will decide in two rounds of the selection who will attend.
Only Crème de la Crème of the many applicants poletí to the us.
In the battle of High Potential at universities will pay according to Dykty still tougher laws.
"We want with our Race to different from the others."
"A simple trip to plachetnici was little power."
It seems that talent of the scout Dykta my luck.
"We have stayed in touch with all the participants similar action last year."
"Some soon they will end education and are planned for us to be applying for jobs," he says.
In addition to direct oslovování on kampusu, particularly small and medium-sized companies are classically in the labour market.
"We try to be contacted graduates to professional expositions."
"As for example. at Intersolar" he says Sitha Stübe, head of personnel administration manufacturer of solar engineers Solarworld.
Companies from Bonn in Germany, employing around 1500 employees.
Stübe knows the problems with young workers.
At the moment it is vypsaných 35 posts on the website of the company.
"At the moment it is just hard, to include free places."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is a touch via the professors at universities.
Solarworld collaborating with different universities, for example. the university of Freibergu.
"The professors are told that it is possible for us to do the exercises or to write diplomovou work."
Solar specialists does not hold any expensive promotional events.
Instead, the company is trying to attract other benefits. a person's mood, low hierarchy and light communication.
"Great concerns that they often can not offer," says a leading personal department Stübe.
In search of work for a long time, playing a leading role.
Flexible working hours, arrested children or a good chance of passage is another crucial factor.
Solarworld contained in one study of The instead, Labour of 55. place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The constitution puts together an annual list of best German employers.
While enquires co-workers as they are content to work and work environment and follows general welfare of employees.
The leading personal department Stübe hopes that her location will bring indicates the applicants their jobs.
"I think that applicants are reported separately on external assessment of potential employer" he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from German Employer Branding academies advising companies that want to build a long-term strategy reputation as an employer.
Advises clients to make it more authentic.
And according to Mr Krieglera this means, above all, an internal measure.
"The best way to be visible as attractive employer is through its own employees," he says.
Professionally, this is calling home Employer Branding, then enforce employer on the market within its own employees.
"Contented workforce is the best ambassadors."
While the company is good for people and are identified with the company since then it will be done advertizing employer among friends and acquaintances.
"It is like a game of twine," says Kriegler.
Obama halted the new oil holes
Over the years they will not emerge from the coast US-federal state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico oil the new holes.
The government in Washington issued a corresponding ban - and cancelling definitively earlier plans.
Also from the Atlantic coast are so far, the new holes banned.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has reported on Wednesday.
A strict ban on grounds that it would have to pay at least the next five years, is explosion at vrtné the tower "the Deepwater Horizon" for April.
Prior to the accident which took eleven employees lives and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the us, has described president Barack Obama to pressure from the opposition and industry willingness to allow a new hole in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Advocates of it seeks to reduce its dependence on the us supplies of oil from abroad.
To date, has not clearly explained who bears responsibility for a devastating oil disaster in the gulf.
The midst of criticism is British energy for BP, which has faced a billion applications.
Commission of inquiry that would have given Obama, should submit the results during December.
In the October abolish the interior Ken Salazar a ban on digging, which paid from the explosion.
In turn, has various oil concerns to a request for new vrtné purposes.
Obama and Salazar wanted to prevent a similar disaster by tighter controls and striktními safety regulations.
At the moment it is fundamentally reformed audit office, which has alerted many corruption allegations.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would cancel lucrative possibilities of tax evasion for oil and gas.
The industry now openly warns that tougher regulation would substantially reduce the amount těžené of oil in the gulf.
"The government plans is the biggest brake on the growth of the gas and oil industry" is this the result of the current research in the field of consulting firm BDO - before the prohibition of digging on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance has yet to complains to the uncertainty in the field. "No one is unaware that the law will change."
Investment in new mining projects, until the appeals move - at the expense of growth.
Ogoni region burned
Water in rivers is oilly brown, this stinks as they draw: billions of litres of oil uniklé destroyed the nature of the Ogoni in Nigeria.
People are living kradením, corruption and illegal cooking oil.
Celestine Akpobari this means well.
"Netrapte," he reassures the journalist: environmental activist "Today you get in front of the lens, and arguably oil mud."
37-year old Nigeriánec followed bid to photograph the boy, who wades after crs the waters that surround smirches. this scene are active in water shine with rainbow-colored colours, almost as many as hezky.
That beneath the surface blond brown sediments of oil, it is not visible.
Before this sum up the vessel had garnel, will tell Esther Badom on the banks of the river Bodo-Jetty.
Meanwhile, became the water slowly going completely dead.
Five years ago, welled into a tepid area from rozbitého managing large amounts of oil.
Fishermen from nearby towns Bodo to paddle at least six hours to get water, where fish. the Ogoni region, which is located in the heart of the delta of the river Niger is among one of the worst zamořených areas in the world.
A trip down the river mangrovníkovými the mosses hand with many tributaries is just felt the entire scope of destruction.
Engine on the boat cook spot light water brown porridge and who will immerse hand to water, will pull oil fingers.
The roots of mangrovníků with a stick from the country as pillars of black licorice, rarely is occuring palma, sadly leaves to hang.
We are looking in vain for the herds of birds, which usually in wet areas occur: Once they die down the engine of a boat, it fell in earlier paradise where it stinks as at the pump, ghostly silence.
"What is happening is green, waging war," says sadly Akpobari: Celestine "We live in constant fear of health."
Comparisons with the war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement is a battlefield, where he has been fighting for decades: more than 60 years ago, there nahrnuli the first conquerors from Europe, here in 80 years, formed the first uprising and later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiw, there was a concern for shell to stop during 1993, production, as it was for employee performance dangerous.
Until now, the Ogoni region is not allowed the company to return: while every day has benefited from the entire area of delta about threefold the size of Switzerland, with more than 5000 mining holes and 7000 kilometres of the lead of more than two million barrels of black gold, lie oilfields in the Ogoni of harmony, for concern is that the power unstable.
Every few hundred metres with a stick from water steel structure as bizarre sculpture. " Christmas tree" little, so very gently until they call the heads vrtných of opening.
They are 50 years old, the majority of up zrezivělá marrow.
Every moment will be broken vrtného the head of the east, will tell Akpobari, and then flows out a steady stream of oil into the water.
According to estimates by experts have flowed out into the ecosystem in the delta more than two billion litres for 50 years. Every year the number of oil, which flowed out to sea at Aljašky at the crash supertankeru "" Exxon Valdez 21 years ago - one of the largest environmental catastrophes in the history of mankind.
There are disputes, who is to continue to block the environmental responsibility.
While charge of shell signals, sabotage and organised theft of oil for more than 90 percent of the pollution, the protectionists the environment on praskajících the heads of holes and not a narrow lead as the main cause.
Shell in Nigeria requires a much smaller safety regulations than in the world of fashion, has accused it of 2008 US-American scientist Richard Steiner. Only the amount of disorder on the administration has said it is "několikanásobně higher than elsewhere."
On the ground, which looks from a distance as deserted, dirty oil workshop in the open air, will emerge from mangrovníků the character: they are completely naked and after a neck from oil.
Under one of the many kegs, which are partly linked by management, partly to arbitrarily scattered over the country, fire fire: illegal small refinery.
Oil found in keg of fire heats up for several hours, explains Michael, a leading group.
Ahead will be out of the running to záchytného the pot petrol, later drips at the end of the guidance kerosin finally diesel.
That way she did Michael and his four colleagues every day to four kegs after 300 litrech. "We will earn 34.000 Naira" - around 22 dollars.
The inhabitants of the delta benefit from chronic shortage of fuel oil in the largest state in the Dark Continent.
Nigeria own only one refinery.
Ridiculously low price of of 40 cents for a litre of diesel manufacturers may be illegal and overcharge. as they have raw materials free of charge.
She comes from " bunkerů," which combine to the lead around the Ogoni region. according to the experts, and in the whole area of delta of the river Niger lose the country every day at least of 16 million litres of oil.
But only a small part of insignificantly provisionally skladované of raw materials, illegally will refine. The biggest share will fill organised criminal networks, which have seen and politicians and high profile members of the military, the tankers and will sell it on the world market.
Debate over whether caused by the disaster and their pictures or lax way of production, sees activist Akpobari as a purely academic.
"If they did not think the oil companies as an intruder and, if so, we would not destroy the essence of fishermen, it was not even sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
Meanwhile, but the Ogoni primarily to shell and ruined what seems to be considered only the departure of concern. "Maybe it will show other nations as Chinese as better."
Michael will agitate.
"High time they disappeared," says muscular producer.
"Every time may come soldiers."
If we had found a special military unit, so they no doubt it does not threaten the prison, but the painful bribe.
Also, the soldiers who have largely come from the north of the country - like all Nigeriánci - they want to profit from the raw material.
"Tadle prokletá things got our country with all due respect to the bottom," says Akpobari.
Investigators found unsafe building mistake in the A380 engines
A380 is obviously a safety defect.
Investigators discovered in a search of the machine, which emergencily landed, perhaps a mistake that could lead to " catastrophic failure" of the engine.
The airline Qantas want to prosecute the manufacturer of engines.
Passenger Airbus the company's Qantas had at the emergency landing early November seem to have more luck than has so far been known. the Australian bureau for flight safety investigation discovered in a safety defect to the engines of some A380 aircraft - and now warns of possible constructive mistake.
A possible defect would have severe consequences. in one context of oil could create fissures because of opotřebování, said this Thursday in a statement issued by ATSB office.
This could lead to " catastrophic failure" of the engine.

The boss of the company by Qantas Alan Joyce said that his company will demand compensation for an incident earlier November.
During a fire engine were released job and those damaged the area.
Rolls-Royce described as the reasons for the loss of burning oil.
It must replace around the world after the event up to 40 engines.
Australian researchers announced that they would carry out further safety tests with giant aircraft, which are equipped with the appropriate engines.
Safety recommendations are the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce spokesman, said the ATSB Martin Dolan.
A security flaw was deemed sufficiently important to be informed all the relevant.
After the emergency landing of the machine, Qantas airlines fleet A380 several weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines has left three of the eleven A380 temporarily on earth.
Lufthansa has replaced at one of the A380 engines as security measures.
Two-storied aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.

More than 10.000 people uctilo the memory zasypaných of the miners in New Zealand, who were prohlášeni for dead after several explosions in below.
Still failed to free the dead, because in the shaft is the security situation remains difficult.
Two weeks ago, made in Pike River will almost slide near cities to Greymouth a massive explosion.
29 miners aged 17 to 62 have been imposed in below.
The shaft where the accident occurred was spuštěná the probe, did not appear but no indication for life.
Because of the high concentration of poisonous gases and the following an explosion could not because of safety descend rescue efforts.
After another strong detonation came to power and experts from what miners already have no chance of survival.
It still failed to free the dead.

It hit the horror of art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn try to hide again the old border with fighter epos "Walhalla Emerging."
On what the audience about the idea of a Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, when stirred up "Walhalla Emerging"?
Captured vikingský fighter with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) will be freed from mučitelů and on a large scale kills almost supernatural forces with adversaries - says that ideally for young audiences gentleman's who seek bloody because our hero helps the harsh methods of killing enemies tears and even the entrails of the stomach alive when he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, one-eyed, as it is called in fact, throughout the film will not say the word and the other characters will make at most, one or two sentences or will leave it to exempt into distressful umírajícím exclamations.
Otherwise it is quiet and debauches in horrifically beautiful Scottish hill country that offers scenery world Vikingů before a thousand years ago.
The film is an ideal rather for adults enthusiast of cinema with an interest in Existentialism and very calm intervention of the camera.
It is good for my film more target groups, it is just a pity that are mutually - exclusive.
Director Winding Refn, after turning crude and stylizovanou trilogy about drug dealers " Official," is regarded as the Danish version of the director Quentin Tarantin, stoically, but advocates to work you have handled more by the whims of the mainstream or less by the brutality of artistic audience.
Most of the fan art cinema will probably get discouraged, spraying the brain and entrails.
Supporters action films will be irked at the latest when he publishes one-eyed from free to explicable reason with the stormy Christian missionaries of ships to Jerusalem and remains, to hang an entire timelessness in bezvětří and mist than probably going to get a team to America and there is silent.
It is therefore not about to be surprised that in Germany "Emerging" Walhalla not get into the cinemas and now been published exclusively on DVD.
It is a pity, mainly because of a beautiful pictures, but also because, under a separate front, at times when zborcenou blood, cinema is exciting that deserved a bit of attention.
In this film is not about the dialogues or precise action, all the feverish atmosphere, sen, who became a movie.
And since this is not a spectator for the flight.
Refn it will not want either the moment of release him and slowly chokes icy grim pictures and hypnotic soundtrackem, above all, unspeakable hatred that trickles from the hearts of characters.
Little blond boy who helps the one-eyed, will retain something of a innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Most of all, one-eyed hero whose motives are never going to explain that will be the time for enemies and allies passing a soldier from hell, maybe an ambassador ďábla.
Playing doom, you might as well just for these rotten.
"Walhalla Emerging" is a mysterious film which it is possible to hate and admire, angry, enthusiasm and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious terrestrial job
The IAEA'S nuclear energy has a new warning about secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country, however, prevents expressions - and neither will not allow inspections.
Around midnight from 5 to 6, September 2007 will fall at least four Israeli F-15 fighter aircraft and mysterious square building in Syria.
Standing on the shore; Euphratu the nearest big city, district 30 miles and is called the Dair as-Saur.
In documents international authority on nuclear power (IAEA) appears on his behalf when it comes to the reactor which allegedly brought Syria with the help of North Korea in the square schovaném in the valley, which draws from the mainstream.
According to the message US-American foreign intelligence of the CIA since the end of the year 2008, the reactor, also known by the name close to the village el-Kibar, well cast for the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
A technician from the 1950s on anything that does not fit.
The CIA has provided video with nezaostřenými satellite images.
By using computer animation made it clear where which components of the reactor before the destruction could be, there has to be a zmenšenou a copy of North korea's pattern Yongbyon nuclear facility.
In addition, were even submitted photos that showed the building at first hand, or even from inside.
Reactor was it said shortly before the launch, but even without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, is not known for power over at that time, even the riddles of time and increased.
Earlier US-president George W. Bush recently published in pamětech that the CIA was before the attack far from certain that Syria el-Kibar builds into the reactor, but basically had no grounds that the country is " active nuclear weapons programme."
Some reporters of the secret services in Europe are even more cautious and talk only about the " alleged reactor," although the presentation of the CIA, they considered " credible."
Lack clear evidence, as well as the IAEA.
At issue, as it is certain that still has a reactor, he said in the summer senior UN diplomat IAEA has said it is "sufficient material to ask questions."
The debris apparently "no use" military buildings was quickly Syřany no doubt odklizená and also properly flushed the field.
However, managed to find June IAEA 2008 team under the leadership of former chief inspector Olli Heinonen into el-Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people.
Taking over the IAEA member states commercial satellite photos sales since immediately after the attack, which should be more apt than those given by the CIA.
Unfortunately, are not these interventions in the market, because exkluzivně has bought unknown client - perhaps Israel.
The IAEA therefore can not confirm its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that should never a secret nuclear programme and did not build the reactor.
Uranium came from Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
But denied that the IAEA after analysing particles.
Since then, Damascus declines on the matter to be discussed - as well as on satellite images.
In addition to revisers has banned a second investigation into el-Kibar and access to rozbombardované rubble of the building.
But Israel has doggedly is silent.
"We will not be never to comment," recently confirmed by official view at the time, the dominant prime minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case is, in vain for 2008 and June " has grown into a major problem with regard to the credibility of power," both admitted senior western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - it is still a serious breach of contract over a ban on nuclear weapons, which supervises the IAEA.
The IAEA is considered a key to pokročení on three other equipment to be functional "in connection" with the alleged reactor - and they even exist in contrast to him.
Revisers at the same time, until now, has not given, or which plants it, or what they have worked or why they are suspicious.
According to the information to a newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally describes as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived according again to close the town.
The independent institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identify those objects and based on satellite images of the complex of buildings, which is probably one of suspicious objects.
Apparently they are inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military bases - it is for this reason that Syria rejects the IAEA access to these three places.
In vienna, said that Syřané concerns the so-called " fishing expedition - that would be the IAEA previously sent the us to study military bases.
The detectives were alerted to equipment by the secret service the us.
The IAEA has bases and satellite images, that among these three places and square at Euphratu transportoval material here and there.
In vienna, said a senior western diplomat that at least one zařízená should be "in relation to produce fuel."
Do not exist yet " no evidence of senzibilních activities" about the enrichment of uranium and remake; processes that are needed to produce nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by although the uranium, which is not obohacený.
But from where the uranium would come from, and where it later had odštěpit plutonium for the bomb, at the central question there is only likely estimates.
It is also not known whether the rubble that could conceal important signs are stow on these three places.
It is as if they have disappeared from the surface of the earth's hundreds of the cost of freight cars, no one seems to know where the debris was given.
Just a few kilometres from el-Kibar district and on the other side Euphratu lying salt mine al-Tibni to take Syria to control during 1998 as a proper storage of radioactive waste, sees the IAEA as unlikely.
Previous IAEA inspector Robert Kelley, it has given the context of the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for the prestigious journal Jane's Intelligence Review.
Pictures of the universe but reveal that after the IAEA asked approach by Syria at all suspicious places terrestrial work and remove the large containers.
It could be an accident, but did not help clarify suspicions.
Moreover, talk of diplomatic circles about what the IAEA spent many months by creating a plan for a revisers, which will allow me to Syria to hold the potential of military secrets - only that wrestling shows how big is the interests of revisers.
Damascus, meanwhile, rejected that proposal.
If even a year ago, calmed western diplomats in Vienna that is still a reactor destroyed, so this point not on fire, speaks for several months, us ambassador Glyn Davies on the so-called special inspections, which is one of the hardest means the vienna nuclear powers to enforce control.
The IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, with visits to propose no doubt already talked about " option, in the future I am inclined" to which the meantime, however, is hesitant.
This election is a big risk: On one side is the need for a majority in guvernérské the IAEA proposal and many of the countries represented of 35 does not have a firm interest in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat cautions. "What happens if anything, they do not find?"
Love in the time of the war
Since Angelina Jolie began in the summer to work on overhead still nameless first fruit, found trouble.
He wrote a script, it is a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
On many more is not yet known, but even this is causing unease.
It is persistently talked about what is this woman, who is muslimka will love during the war in Yugoslavia to the Serbian man who violated.
Bosnia's women's bodies immediately protested, so hastily planned downloads shifted from Sarajeva to Hungary.
The film, meanwhile in Hungary dotočil and is in postprodukci, but still protests in Bosensku themselves.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote over a UN- organisations to aid to refugees UNHCR Jolie and demanded a meeting with actress, now has told newspapers - bosnia's Jolie is also the Ambassadress of UN- organisations on aid to refugees.
It is not exactly diplomatic - offered women before the weeks of meetings in Hungary but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In camps where they were violated, the love stories did not take place and position Jolie to the victims argue enough about the script.
His organisation has recommended then UN- organisations on aid to refugees to Jolie made redundant as Ambassadress, told the Guardian.
What images just wrote Jolie?
The Bosnian ministry of culture, which reaches reading his script, allowed after shrinking tahanicích in Sarajevo - the recording is not entirely clear why, then, however, Jolie did not come.
A young author points out that in the film does not follow any political plans that serious efforts provided by the conflict in Yugoslavia that he wants to show the awful aftermath of the war, and all stakeholders to make room.
Given the content remains unclear.
Online pass another version of the film, which is really quite different: lovers knew one another before the start of the war and again they will meet when she was muslimka as Bosnian serb zavlečená to camp, where he serves as guardian.
That really sounds quite differently from "rape victim will be loved to mučitele."
The fact that Jolie film really begins even before the war - is real.
Jolie objects that it is for him develop the pressure that "it is not fair and is based on erroneous information."
Now it may be free is already hekeři from Hollywoodu. That will be issued illegally online its script how much longer do.

Common practice of democracy
Promoting democracy in Latin America is growing, as well as promoting private enterprise.
Crime inspire more fear than unemployment.
And brazilian many regions is considered more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of current exploration Latinobarómetro, held in 18 countries and coming out exkluzivně in The Economist.
Since research performs regularly back to 1995, can follow changes in attitudes across field.
In this year's survey, which was conducted by the September and the start of October, dominated by two related matters.
The first is that Latin America is quite funny mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Promoting democracy in several countries on the periphery the pacific in South America has been on the rise (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where there are 2002 growth in average of 6% a year, has increased support for democracy from a minimum of 40% in the 2005 to 61% this year.
Rose also in Mexico, where the economy recover after a deep slump in output last year.
But only around half dotázaných in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most populous areas, are convinced democrats, who contracts the regional average (see graph 2).
About 44% of respondents across fields have voiced satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their own country, this is the same figure as last year but compared with 2001 when she was about 25%, that is a big increase (3) graf.
Some 34% said that they trusted the house in the country and 45% confides government, again, it is the same figure as last year, but this is a big difference compared to 2003 (17%, 24%).
Ten years ago, undermining democracy in Latin America economic crisis.
Foster was created during the global financial crisis is probably because many Latin - American countries have suffered from a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social safety net to help protect poor people.
(A commission from the United Nations in Latin America this week said that the relationship Latinoameričanů living in poverty has increased during 2009 and only slightly this year has fallen to 32%.)
The mood changes, but in a broad range from country to country (see graph 4).
Strong economic performance in Brazil and popularity of his outgoing president Luize Inácia Luly da Silva, is reflected in a widely přijímaném the sense of progress.
This situation is scarcer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession more severe and has worsened the situation of violent crime.
Only the second time since they were starting to perform research, sees more respondents across Latin America as the most important problem of crime rather than unemployment (see graph 5).
About 31% states that are themselves or their close relatives were last year by victims of crime, but this is a decrease compared with the figure of 38% from the previous year and is also the lowest number of of 1995.
More massive economic powers are reflected in the growing support for private enterprise, and a market economy. approximately 71% of respondents across fields says that private enterprise is essential to the development, the percentage has risen from 56% to 2007 (see graph 6).
58% Agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow the development of their country, that percentage rose 47% percent from last year.
Interestingly, 62% percent of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and there is backing 80% private business), though their leftist president Hugo Chavez expropriates many private firms.
Brazil is a country that has a leader in the field of how the 19% respondents (compared with 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to the previous year, unchanged) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is seen as the most influential country by informants in Mexico and in much of Central America, while Venezuela has succeeded in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections have criticized
No one should expect to be a general election in Haiti for day of 28. November perfect.
But there were far worse than the outsiders who are trying to help the stricken country that feared.
The election was a plnící the urn and opakující from voting, voting list rozmetané after the channels rozbité polling station and intimidation.
Polling stations open after hours of delays.
Many Haiťanů, including many přestěhovaných because of the January earthquake, wandered around and trying to find out where they can go to vote.
Some of them eventually abandoned.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several expected předběžců yelled that this is a sham and called for the cancellation of the election.
Protesters, some of them violent nature, it has spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, a highly placed UN official in Haiti, said that "in many respects act is quite good choices."
Observers from the organization of american states and the Caribbean community care, said that "believes that these irregularities, there were serious, but not necessarily lift the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral body that opposition voices are bound by René Prévalovi, unpopular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestinovi, is set to announce preliminary results of a day of 7, December.
The decisive battle is scheduled for January.
All the hope is not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates Michel Martelly, raper and Mirlande Manigat, a former First Lady, has withdrawn from the original invitation to vote for prohlášeno invalid.
But the problem can arise if mr. Célestin, which has a small or insignificant support among voters, will be labelled by the electoral commission for having scored the decisive battle.
Řádící because of an outbreak of cholera and more than 1 million people after the earthquake are still living in tents, there were concerns that turnout will be low.
Finally, many Haiťanů he wanted to choose, but because of the dezorganizace them in that prevent.
Some 250 of thousands of identity cards that are necessary for a vote, leaving shortly before the election nerozdělené.

After the peaks in the heart
In the weeks when she suddenly become widowed, has benefited Cristina Fernández, Argentine president, from the sympathies of the public, when his popularity has grown from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was 2007.
However, the reversal of that success into a successful campaign for a second term in elections next year may depend on whether truchlící Ms Fernándezová will pay nekompromisnosti deceased husband and predecessor and political partner Néstora Kirchnera.
And all will be based on these features.
Mr Kirchner, which used in economic policy, after his wife successfully became president, had a way of drawing - up a budget that underestimated tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend extra revenue, according to entertainment.
The government of Ms Fernándezové lost last year, the majority in Congress.
But the opposition was separated and then destabilizována at the death of Mr Kirchnera at heart attack by day of 27. the October.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movements have been added to Ms Fernández.
But after chaotic meeting (which came to fackování and the seduction of the government of corruption), Congress has failed to pass a budget for 2011.
"I am not going to argue," said the president.
The of 2010 budget will now also apply for next year, leaving president will have more leeway to spend according to entertainment.
The economy was taking excessive přehřívá. this year it is likely to grow to 9%.
The official inflation rate is now 11,1%, but many private forecasts and trade unionists talking about a figure that is nearing 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who came into office in the year 2003, when Argentina harassed economic collapse, set a priority on growth and poverty reduction, rather than on controlling inflation.
It has refused to negotiate with the imf, oppressed private sector and wiped INDEC, statistical agency, which agreed to monitor the official inflation figures.
Now the president can Fernándezová umírnit this policy?
He called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And its officials say they want the next year to curb the growth of wages to 18%.
The economy was supported by the rise of the world market price for the export of argentina's agricultural products.
But inflation has undermined growth based on a big devaluation of 2002.
That may be why the president Fernándezová favors to know that he wants to restore argentina's financial link to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government created an agreement with the holders of the bonds, which earlier rejected a restructuring of the debt which Argentina during 2001 did not apply.
Now he faces the Fernándezová an agreement with lenders governments that are seskupené in the Paris Club, which owe around 6,7 billion dollars.
Kirchners have always insisted that it did not have on the oversight BOARD, as is customary.
But last month, Amado a shack, the minister for economic affairs announced that the fund will provide " technical assistance" for the proposed new national consumer-price index which will remember opening to clarify the INDEC.
It is still not clear whether the president Fernándezová will want to stay in politics after completing his term, by which time her husband is not after his hip.
If you would like to stay, he needs to win the support of the middle class, which is tired kirchnerismem.
At the time of the Argentinians return from summer vacation with March, will be a wave of sympathy to get worse.
If he wants to win the next election, it will have to decide whether it will not be necessary in silence to renounce many positions that her husband in the policies advocated.
Half of the stimulus to China
Taiwanští constituents are closer to close connections to land.
That Taiwan thinks of big brother's across the ocean?
More than 7,5 miles. voters, 70% from legitimate, choosing day of 27. November mayors and city councils in five urban districts, which can be viewed as a wider assessment of president Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is a representative of feeling they were to land and have the insertion of a strong business relationships, including an agreement to partly free trade, most in alignment of relations with China of of 1949.
President Ma has undergone a test, but only just.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) ended a win in three of the five offices of the mayor, has failed to win a majority of the votes.
In addition, democratic progressive party, the Democratic Progressive groups (DPP), which is open to greater independence by Taiwan, received almost 50% votes to 45% party KMT.
If this was a presidential elections, should the president Ma of trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of votes for his party has fallen by around 8%.
For the first time, the DPP, coupled with the KMT city councils.
The elections took place as the most taiwanských of the election, which include noisy election trucks and a mass meeting of vlaječkami the spore oděnými the girls.
The amount was still obligatory mysterious attempt at trying.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chana, honorary chairman of the KMT, was to agitate for the candidates KMT on the eve of the election.
Mr from the group shot the young man Lien purely across the face, injured him and killed spectator.
Bizarrely it was not intended to have a soldier intend to injure him for Liena or to settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, manager of DPP, arguing that influenced the selection of shooting, suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only great champion of campaign was China.
It was remarkable how remained in the background, the mainlands.
Instead, the candidates wrestled over plans for a national housing and job creation.
Taiwan is usually used de facto independence, and hate the military threat from China.
KMT therefore has a tendency to avoid links to the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP has fallen from vzbuzování anti-Chinese position.
It is a reaction to the facts and knowledge, that china's trade is vital for economic survival Taiwan.
President Ma for his party confirmed that china's policy is, for the most part, Taiwan acceptable.
The government in Beijing is expected that he will continue to pursue business bribes, along with a strategy to Taiwan attracted back to the pack.
China did not waste any time during the deployment of negotiator to Taipeje to hold a summit on investment protection and medical association.
Certainly also would like to see political integration, but popořadě.
It would be better to wait after the presidential elections of 2012.
The DPP it anyway, found itself.
Two years ago he was at the wrong level. its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to jail on charges of corruption.
President in 2000-08 was a rebel and supporter of clear independence.
But under the leadership of Ms Tsai has developed a new generation that is modest and DPP work hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms Tsai was proclaim DPP as a candidate for president, such as Suu Tseng-changem, who held the power under Mr Chenem.
Their side now is making every effort to show that they too can cooperate with Beijing.
Ms Tsai published by plans for research institutes, who serves as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their actions can proceed without prior conditions.
Ms Tsai taiwanské informs public that his party represents " a credible alternative" to early access to Mr Ma to China.
Mr Chen is angry that the move.
In a statement issued from mobile expressed the view that the DPP was doing better if we insist that Taiwan is a separate homeland.
Once ordered Mr Suu, pragmatic not to run for president.
But even without the intervention of Mr Chena DPP will fight the election among potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search their own people.
The assessment of Mr Ma was wrong, and that despite the precipitous pace of economic growth; candidates with KMT did not want to go to the campaign.
Her popularity seems not to be based mainly on unemployment and the widening of the gap between rich and poor.
KMT spokesman said that přeorganizuje administration, as well as local branch.
Heavily pursued proposals to help Taiwan for establishing friendly contacts were limited.
It also considers the majority of citizens taiwanských economic integration with China as an inevitable.
According to Antonio Chianga, a prominent publicity, "the show, which returned, has not been generated."

The microbes with the resistance to arsenic increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or else
Discovering strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of nutrients, expands the scope for finding new types of life on Earth, and perhaps even further.
Researchers found that bacteria here on Earth, arguing that it is a sign that life is the possibility that costs outside the main elements that were still regarded and basic.
"This organism has a dual personality."
"The growth is due to phosphorus or arsenic."
"This is very strange, but that is no evidence that this is some sort of form a "extra-terrestrial" life," to comment on this fact, Paul Č. W. Davies of Arizona State university, a co-author of the report, which occurred on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
Long been regarded as essential for life for six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, the scientists found that bacteria, appearing in Mono Lake in California, are able to continue to grow after the arsenic will replace phosphorus.
"You will start to be surprised that everything is still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State university, a co-author of the report.
This discovery is important for the search for life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to identify life and know how life might look like Anbar, he said.
The study looked at the microbes nalezené on Earth.
However, a report on the news published to be discussed, who did not reveal the details of the discovery, has prompted widespread speculation on the Internet, the report reveals the discovery extra-terrestrial life.
That is not the case.
"The discovery shows that other planetary organisms might be able to use other elements who go biochemistry and that the kind of things that we regard as "standard" he does not have to be for life, so absolutely necessary," explained Charles Cockell, professor of Planetary and Space Science Research institute, Open university in Milton Keynes, uk.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows replacing one element of another element in the basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It was not an accidental discovery.
Felisa simon Wolfe- from the Astrobiologického institute at NASA, who led the study, looked at Mono Lake because it reveals high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus is chemically very similar features, given that the microbe that has exposed both elements may be able to replace one after the other.
"Arsenic are poisonous mainly because its chemical behaviour is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can very hard on those elements from being separated."
"However, arsenic is so different that just as phosphorus is not working. When it comes to the organism will start work in biochemical processes," explained Anbar.
Scientists have collected bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposes is a growing concentrations of arsenic that the bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
The microbes are growing at a better job of phosphorus, but given that they can survive with the replacement of arsenic, increasing the possibility that the kind of life that use arsenic, can arise naturally, be anywhere else on Earth, or on another planet or a month where arsenic is more common.
Jamie s. Foster, a career assistant mikrobiologie at the university of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic that could be replaced by a phosphorus is not new, but it was never found an example, this fact was able to.
Arsenic is more prevalent in an earlier time on Earth, he said, so the scientists speculate that it could benefit from the earlier forms of life.
"This suggests that might be other ways to create life, not just by the way in which it evolved at an early stage of the country," said Foster, who was not part of the research team Wolfe- simon.
The research was supported by NASA, the department of energy and the national institute of medical

Women are like floral vases, said and added, "in addition to being a vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, the deputy director of the central city provincial capital, with that description highly disagree.
But podotknul that the requirements for the height are commonplace in China also working on another position, at both sexes.
Just as entitled to symmetrical features of the face.
Which means that the issue is between visage, the subject of debate.
Disability or mutilation is certainly will not apply.
"Can not allow our lame or a hunchbacked person," said Mr Zheng.
"Her image was not good."
Liu Yi, who holds sentry square Baoguang in the vicinity of the convention, did 22 years, the face as little apple and gently tvarovaná mouth.
He does not believe that focus on her views could have sexistický stroke, he said.
"Do you think that in this uniform I am going to look like a sexy?" he asked with ironic perspective.
It spolupracovnice with dolíčkama, 21-year old Yang Xu says "our job is to represent the image of the city."
No objections to the limited power, he said, because their career ambition is more than just zahánět retailers to an alley where they can operate.
Every morning, a group of more than a decade, the men who run around on foot or on wheels and seeks to sell as many little dumplings and tofu bowls before they will be expelled.
"Mr Wangu, you need to leave."
"You that we have said many times!" he said ms Xu, when the market started to run, and at the time, went round with a trolley with pasta.
Police describe their duties as more monotonous than distortions.
"Every day it is basically the same thing," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies in leisure marketing.
" A great routine."
One reason is that the female policewomen have no powers as their male counterparts to confiscating goods sales.
They can only undermine that the truth will announce the male manager.
So the tendency is to protect the public from sudden displays of hostilities against the official apparatus, which are common throughout China.
This year from hundreds of civilians in Kunmingu, capital of Yunnan province, they stormed after it was spreading false rumours about the fact that they have killed policisti sales.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the overnight hours. 14 government vehicles were reversed or ecstatic.
Xindu so far escaped the kind of violence.
But calm may be some difficult.
Only two blocks from a quiet square Baoguang where this morning had a sentry for a policewoman, at the corner of wall street gathered more than 50 people.
Officers seized a motorcycle which was corrected to the sidewalk place inside the sale of how the legislation.

If Xuedong, 40, a coordinator přičleněný to male group, fell behind, its white label was a blow to hide his name.
As a female, policewomen coordinators are men over 40 who already have only auxiliary role.
Unlike them are not educated in maintenance and uhlazování image.
"Sometimes we fight to."
"Sometimes we compete physically," he told mr věcně.
"Mostly, it is the public who with it begins."
Prosecutors do not blame the Senator Ensigna
The prosecutors of the department of justice wiped Senator John Ensign of criminal charges involving his affair with a former adviser to the campaign and his attempts to secure the lobby, announced on Wednesday, lawyers for Senator.
The decision ends the most serious regulatory threat that mr. Ensign, nevadský a Republican, has faced, and who was it when the time of the affair, considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His scandal made national headlines and damaged his career.
The body of Mr Ensigna said that was a decision that followed almost a year after an investigation, "certainly delighted."
Senator still face scrutiny in disciplinárnímu ethics commission Senate.
Lawyers for Mr Ensigna said that the ministry of justice "to inform us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the target of investigations and that it is not planning to raise an additional charge him in this matter."
The department of justice into the case, declined to comment.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the ministry of justice who claimed that there is significant evidence that mr. Ensign has prepared a violation of the ban on federal lobbying.
In interviews, emails and other documents that were published in the October 2009 in the New York Times reported that mr. Ensign helped Douglasu Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure lucrative lobby who should lead to silence Mr Hampton and his wife, Cynthie, on senátorově a relationship with him.
Ms Hamptonová once worked as treasurer of the campaign Ensigna.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for mr. Hampton and promote their views after Mr Hampton dealt with that for them loboval, says documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was until recently an assistant of Mr Ensigna, was by law from lobbying their former employer or Senate for the year is excluded.
Experts on the ethics claim that unusual legacy of Mr Ensigna and Mr Hampton that was before the scandal friends, appeared at odds with a ban on lobbying.
From the evidence that had been issued "it became clear that this is a clear case of preparation of a breach of the law," said Stanley, A Washington lawyer who specialised in defence of the clients who are vyšetřovaní by the government.
While officials from the ministry of justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision on the matter of Senator Ensigna, Mr Stigma and other lawyers with distinction on the official said the ministry is careful to political claims, after a number of setbacks, including a ruling from last year to suspend legal proceedings against former Senator Tedu Stevensovi at the centre of the allegations of a national representation.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hide weapons," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a legal group that made the subject of several complaints against Mr Ensignovi.
"It shows virtually at what they do not apply to the highly turned government officials with the laws," he added.
Paul Coggins, a divorce lawyer for Mr Ensigna, in an interview reported that one on Monday called the public prosecutor's office of the ministry of justice, and then the next day, and told him that the department did not find his client against any accusations.
Obhajovací a team of Mr Ensigna is cooperating with prosecutors in a bid to persuade them that Senator, as his office Wednesday reiterated in a statement, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to set a legal arguments that handed prosecutors.
"I am not a pleasant to describe the details of my discussions with the department of justice in addition, we believe we made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the federal election commission's decision to suspend the investigation separate complaint, in which the moral group favors accusations that the payment of parents Ensigna Hampton of 96,000$ violated federal election law.
The electoral commission said that he did not have enough evidence to show that the money did not mean anything other than offer.
One company, for which mr. Ensign helped mr. Hampton to find lobbying work was the company NV Energy, the principal nevadská company has long supported Senator.
One e-mail from December of 2008 showed that after he started Mr Hampton in society to work as a lobbyist, the head of the employees of Mr Ensigna - John Lopez, communicated with Mr Hampton and told him that " pounded" to the interior ministry about being debated subject.
Mr. Ensign also attend lunch with Mr Hampton and other nevadským client, Allegiant air and called on the Transport Minister, to reasoned sitting on behalf of airlines after they will hire mr. Hampton for lobbying work.
When the previous year for the first time found a report on the scandal, Mr Ensign apologised voters and resigned at work, as fine a fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After mnohaměsíční stagnation mr. Ensign two weeks ago reported to reporters that it is scheduled to attend a third term in the Senate.
In a report that mr. Ensign is no longer a target of the investigation of the crime of its spokesmen Jennifer Cooper said that the Senator is hoping that the commission will quickly follow the ministry of justice and will complete a full investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing the hard work in the name nevadského of the people," said further.
The appeal of community Cheshire is turning to Twitter
Half a dozen of them wrote in a series of court room.
Minute by minute sent to the news of the horrific testimony via Twitter.
Finally, the defence says that more than 140 of the 000 messages on Twitter about rape and přivazováním children into the beds in the house, which was light.
On Thursday he held the pleading of Steven J. Hayese, who was convicted of killing three civilians Cheshire, Connecticut, family, and should be implemented an official end to the imposition of the death penalty, the jury voted for.
But lawyers for Mr Hayese already donated a court appeal to the claims and arguments that the court would probably address the years.
One of the most irritating thing is that intensive reporting about the process - including the widespread use Twitter main reporters - created a "cirkusovou atmosphere" and that an expanded penetration, first-hand information with pobuřujícími the details then implementing jury at the decision in terms of interferences with public opinion.
That could force the judge to address the question of whether with the advent of new technologies not to impose new rules also in the court room.
"As I have seen in this pleading, I think there is a real danger that the integration of new technologies in the court room affect the rights to a fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the chief lawyer of Mr Hayese.
The trial judge gave Jon c. Blue of the courts and tribunals of state briefly rejected assertions regarding revenue from last week and with what the media was "carefully controlled" and that there is no evidence that would show at what jury had acted under the influence of the public.
But is not likely to be the last word in this case.
The courts had for decades that intelligence notorious cases can cause questions about the fairness of the process.
In the judicial order of of 1966 of the Supreme court of the United States abolished the conviction clevelandského chiropraktika, Dr it Shepparda for the murder of his wife when he said in his ruling that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, the process, because of the media talks about "karnevalovou atmosphere."
Some are confident that this offence was the inspiration tv show and film " refugee."
Some lawyers said that the court of appeal would investigate Hayesův judgment about half a century later, it might be surprised by the argument that could be vital new rules that define a way to communicate away from court halls that have been in the case of Dr Sheppard unimaginable.
"There is common ground to concerns over the impact of new media" in high-profile cases, said John J. Donohue III, professor law Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticutu and wrote the report, said it was carrying out a arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be zaujati the idea that limiting direct communication away from court halls can make the process fairer.
If Twitter is just one of many lawyers outlined by Mr Hayese who might be able to argue years in order to carry out the sentence delayed.
Defence lawyers also argue for instance, that in the case of Mr Hayese can go against bias, when judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reaction of potential jurors by having them in the choice of jury will show rogue pictures nahánějící terror.
Some of the jurors said that they were zděšeni the pictures of the victims, who had become Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and michael, 11.
Defence lawyers claimed that will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty, claiming that the judge referred incorrectly to the juror who has been critical of the prosecutors, and that the decision was wrongly more pressure on the verdict and directed jury that at the weekend.
Jurors were separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scale of the process can attract the most interest.
He said in the protest against the verdict filed last month that the event dominated news in Connecticutu and was discussed during the election campaign, the candidates for governor and Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media keeps the flames rekindled of emotion on this case.
" Daily rush of media cameras and reporters before the court," wrote lawyer, "was something that here in New Havenu has not yet been to glance, it is perhaps also a national curiosity."
Their focus on his role as Twitter are controversial.
Some journalists said in interviews that first-hand reporting would be more outrageous than report indicated later and from their view would have judicial police to control the scope of other processes.
But some lawyers asked the court of appeal with often used the argument that social and technological changes require an overhaul of the courts.
Lawyers for Mr Hayese try to get this right.
In record was referred to the decision of the Supreme court of of 1966 for the verdict, Dr Shepparda because of the breadth of the functions of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
" this event," he wrote, "an event Sheppard versus Maxwell, a 21st century."
Can overcome a gap services?
After a campaign that was remarkable urážlivostí and negativismem, this week in Washington found small amounts of service.
It is the first swallow a true collaboration between two political parties or just illusional moment before a rapid return to partisan battle in the capital?
Tuesday meeting of president Obama and legislative leaders did not have any major discoveries on major issues that need to be discussed during the meeting.
In any event, but acted against polite discussion about pojednávající differences of the two sides, as well as the definition of their joint responsibility, rather than the empty episode partisan fight.
Wednesday's meeting prezidentovy public deficit commission was also a civilised, despite political differences that remain between members.
It seems that it is clear that close interaction over a period of several months building a mutual respect that goes beyond ideological divide that still divides members.
And it is quite hard to argue that started a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a testing period - probes each other signs kolegiality and compromise, while trying to assess the fringes of public opinion and voličskou patience to renewed partisan war.
It was also a Tuesday meeting and its subsequent evaluation of the participants, made with a minimum requirements or recrimination.
Philosophical differences between Obama and Republikány are too broad and too deep to be proposed rapid change in relations that have prevailed last two years.
It is a question of taxes, spending, healthcare or rights, both sides are on the miles away.
However, November elections produced a Washington at least quickly.
"It is not a question of whether has changed regulatory affairs," said Pete Wehner, The administrator, is now at the Ethics and Public Policy center.
"These are after the election, inevitable.
The election the emotions roused by party-men and then they died down.
It is a good thing."
On several issues, particularly those who have discussed at the meeting, have Republicans and democrats little chance to find a solution.
Bushovo tax cuts at the end of the year would expire and anyone that does not feel good.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, and that permanently or temporarily.
Just as likely compromise on the unemployment benefits only because the Republicans can not look at how they support tax cuts for the wealthy, while the unemployed are disappearing unemployment benefit.
After the Tuesday meeting at the White House is already seeing increased optimism regarding a possible agreement on these issues, along with the approval of the new start treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on critical issues will not necessarily lead to a ratio of two political parties, where 112. Congress assembles for January.
Rather, it is likely period of strife, or even inevitable, he said.
"After they will feel things that must be done, from psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontation," reported.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely an expanded - that the service would take is a true collaboration.
"I look at all of the events between now and 2012 as shadow boxing, when major events occur during 2012," he said.
The reason is largely relates to create a new Republican majority in the White House and a tea party voters that it helped to create.
Republican leaders now face the threat zveličování, they know that they must behave according to its promises and must reduce the cost of government, repeal the New law on healthcare.
These přívrženecké lines are clear in its initial response to the recommendations on the deficit, which involve reforming the tax code and the rise of some taxes, raising the retirement age and cutting spending.
The joint chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles was picked for the role of one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, according to opinion, to put pressure on the issue of deficit to a public program in a way that can not be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18 member commission to plan presented as an official recommendation and then fought to get to that number as approached.
The biggest opposition are among elected officials in the jury who suggest that we have in the case of financial issues, at least today, the small bases or for compromise.
Galston predicts two stages in the fighting between the White House and house Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of partisan conflict, when Republicans invited Obama to address the budget, taxes, healthcare, when watching period will be more partisan cooperation.
That will cause a shift?
Public opinion.
There are plenty of evidence that, despite the partiality in the latest polls, a majority of Americans wants to continue to see two parties that together they work.
If you could go to heel, as was the case in the year 1995, it will be both sides to monitor very closely the reaction of the public.
Anyone can threaten a reduction of votes, probably will change course and will seek a compromise.
This may be optimistic view on the issue.
Partiality and guidelines are now larger than it was in the middle of the 1990s and it turns out that was more ideological gulf between Obama and house Republicans than it was in the case of Republicans, And Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see of 2010 as a prelude to more important elections of 2012.
Based on this reality, a service that has this week it would appear, would welcome a lot of Americans.
It will be the state but many attempts on both sides to find common ground on issues that are still divided.
Betrayed the document describes Moscow as a haven of corruption
The city is in the hands of " kleptokracie" and that is part of the bribes and bribes for protecting coming the way to Kremlinu, said the American embassy in Russia in the records of February.
Police and federal security services largely to keep the wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not just from a legitimate business but also from organised criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which prime minister Vladimir Putin called it a " vertical of power" - will be received when money is starting to move after a ladder up.
The protocol, which was sent to Washington under the name ambasadora John Beyrleho, was on Wednesday disclosed by WikiLeaks on their websites.
Protocol is based on resources, whose names were edit.
It was written while he was still a mayor Yuri Luzhkov and accuses him of a large share of corruption.
He was recalled for October by president Dmitry Medvedevem, but since then we can watch only minimal changes to the purification.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns the leading construction company, for many years, continually denied allegations of corruption and has won a number of legal actions for false charge for such accusations.
September said on Russian television station when he was asked on best evidence of corruption. "It is crazy, it is a mess, it is crap."
Russians with absolute conviction believes that if their company is corrupt, it will show it to a vote.
Of course, it is unusual to encounter such details vyřčenými in a way, ambasádní the report, and is also unprecedented that it did diplomats from foreign countries.
"The government of the city of Moscow and its link with some criminal incidents led to it called "dysfunkční, "and confirmed that the government operates more like a kleptokracie than as a government," says the report.
"Criminal elements from the so-called enjoy. " krysha" (a term from the world of prison and the camorra, which literally means " roof" or expenses), which gives them the police, the federal security service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Home Office and the office of the public prosecutor, like everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analysts are identified and třístupňovou structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"Federal security service, interior and militia were on the second degree."
"Finally, at the lowest levels are common criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an inefficient system in which criminal group fill empty seats in some areas, as some city services does not give."
The report said that the FSB is taking money from the largest companies and the police focus on small businesses.
One source said, "the owners of business in Moscow realise that it is better to get protection from FSB or the interior (rather than from organised criminal groups), since it does not only have more weapons, resources and forces the more criminal groups, but is also protected by law."
"For that reason for protection from criminal gangs is not so in the course."
It says that while the choice of money is complex, protect itself, may have difficulty; and those payments, they may sometimes be arrested.
Those who do not pay quickly enough, their business under various pretexts, they lock.
Medvedev spoke several times to fight corruption, but admitted that made little progress.
Ambasádní report are talking about men beroucích suitcases, probably napěchovanými in cash, in the Kremlinu.
"In the fight against corruption Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats," he said in a recent interview Georgy Satarov, the director of the Moscow research team by hindu.
"But it is a part of this tape."
"It is not part of the political class, because in Russia has the political class does not exist."
No politics, no opposition, without the division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
A hindu estimates that it costs celonárodně corruption russia more than $ 300 billion a year.
Landscape forms of up to 154. in a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are řazeny from at least to most corrupt).
The report's detected the American embassy in Moscow discovered until late in the evening hours certainly does not cause at the Russian government of enthusiasm, although only to the extent that for Moscow shortcomings may be accuse Luzhkov, this could be the Kremlin's a chance to argue in the business of dealing with the problem.
In an interview with CNN, Larrym Kingem told Putin that the documents that WikiLeaks issuing they could be the counterfeits and reacted angrily to the announcement that her American diplomats call a Batman and Robin Medvedeva.
"The fact of the matter is that this is our interact, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we have not thought that this will be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you see, so not ethically."
The veterans red Khmérů are forced to come to terms with the past
In the spore osvětlené concrete schoolroom with dirty and oloupanými the walls of the school's director, Anlong Veng High School, the man who built it, the leader of the red Khmerů the moccasin.
"All of us who love the mocha."
"A good leader and has ensured people," he said Sreng roots, Ma 42.
Known as the "butcher" for atrocities during the government's red Khmerů commander, remains a distant dominion red Khmerů in northwest Cambodia popular, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where they still live thousands of former soldiers of the organisation.
But this year, 12 years after the red Khmerové abandoned government, is nabouraná long-running loyalty also in Anlong Vengu.
In the April was victims on the forum for truth and reconciliation allow the public to be envisaged to people who were part of the regime.
June government said the manual, which for the first time, the children they explain the history of their red Khmerů and former soldiers.
And during July to raise along the Cambodian court of the first convictions of former member of red Khmerů, bringing up a sentence of a former leader, the notorious troubled union Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, známějšího like a ghost, to 35 years in prison.
With every such advances, has increased the unrest among veterans red Khmerů in Anlong Veng, which complicates efforts to reconcile and their attempts to engage in Cambodian society.
"Between the former red Khmery is resentment and fear, but are powerless to do anything," said Youk Chhang, head of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organisation that investigates the regime.
"For them, it was life between red Khmery wonderful, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"Separates this family."
During the government's red Khmerů in Cambodia, from of 1975 to 1979, according to an estimated of 1,7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or adaptation.
When Vietnamci fell and brought down the government of Pol perspiration 1979 the rest of the regime and its soldiers fled on the Cambodian border with Thajskem.
They launched a rebellion that lasted until the last movement for December of of 1998.
Pol perspiration, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary driven by guerrilla war from a base in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while the moccasin grown supporters in Anlong Vengu.
But in half of the 1990s, after the peace deal, sponzorované the country, has led to the first democratic elections of 1993. Large groups of fighters red Khmerů begun to turn to the government, which culminated with levy Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan as 1998.
Pol perspiration died a natural death of 1998 and that the moccasin who gave birth, was 1999 zajat government forces in the mountains nedalých Dangrek.
He died in Phnom Penhském prison 2006 during the waiting on the process.
The guardian has on them not taking care of, most former fighters red Khmerů fell into the usual Cambodian rural life and many of them nostalgically recalls the time of the movement.
Although several elite red Khmerů keep the local government positions in return for their arms, position remains weak, as unskilled farmers.
"These people were from the levy only minimal benefits," said rival Leang from the center for justice and reconciliation, leading public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
"They are surrounded by a utopian agricultural ideology of regime."
"Have been made without any ideas about the realisation of trade."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the red Khmerům as a teenager during 1974, fought in the jungle on Anlong Vengu before he was held as a poor farmer in the year 1998.
"Life under red Khmery was good," he said.
"This moccasin all support."
"But now it is a tough life, because all must guarantee it."
The ongoing trial of red Khmerů also caused concern.
Early next year, will begin court to investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of red Khmerů.
The court has a mandate to prosecute manager přestavitele and those responsible for the crimes, but has not said if he will continue in the four cases.
It was little to be calmed fears in Anlong Vengu.
Recent media speculation focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was a regional leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the government's red Khmerů at the end of the seventies years.
During 2007, say researchers from documentation centre of Cambodia that supervising the construction of the barrier Trapeang Thma, a project that probably killed thousands of forced labour.
A sultry evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field of little wooden house on dirty way beyond Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and they found in the shadows across the arid grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about the past between red Khmery.
If the court called him, he would refuse to go.
"In Cambodia, peaceful and stable," he said.
"If they will find out further prosecutions, will be war."
Prime minister Hun sen, who traversed from red Khmerů of 1978 also repeatedly warned that there will be a instability if the court to seek another suspect, although with this experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia have to exhume a deep hole and bury it in the past," he said.
But confrontation with the past is just what has to Cambodia are doing to move forward, said Youk Chhang of documentation centre.
"Reconciliation in khmerským relationships mean slepení rozbitých pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to give these rozbité pieces together so they can understand."
The centre has issued the first textbook legitimate government of red Khmerech, has 75 pages and the name " history of Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Vengu June as an addition to the handbook of the history of the department of education, which contains fewer than four parties on the red Khmerech.
Like many people in Cambodia, also of young people in Anlong Vengu knew little detail about red Khmerech, despite the addition of the city with the regime.
Hitting Valeak, 19, a student at a secondary school in Anlong Veng said the new guide to help students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted sceptically when he was taken home by paper to the study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"It is podezřívaví because they are not sure how many people will be court to prosecute."
Such opposition does the process of reconciliation more complex and difficult opponent Leang said.
But public forums, textbooks and courts are starting to have an effect, reported further.
Red Khmerové there are still strong magic.
Up in the mountains Dangrek Mountains is the way zarostlá the weeds and vysypaná odhozenými plastovými a bag, leading to an oblong of black soot, the pokrytého zrezivělou tinny roof.
The body of perspiration Pol there was burned on a pile of tyres after his death at 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a saleswoman for mobile phones on the edge of the road said she does not know much about the man who was at this point, incinerate.
"But it has a strong spirit, many local people here goes and prays to it," he said.
Nuom Sothea had his birthday and he was on the order later to visit the place of rest Pol of perspiration, where he will deliver a ripe banana, in the hope that it will bring good fortune.
Belarus agrees that seems stockpiles of weapons on the basis of uranium
In překvapivém win the campaign of president Obama on securing nuclear material around the world, said the government of belarus on Wednesday that they would give up their stockpiles of highly obohaceného uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued after a security summit Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Belarusian foreign minister Sergeiem Martynovem.
The American government has been trying for years to persuade belarus to give up highly obohaceného uranium and it seemed that the stumbling block hit last spring.
But u.s officials told The Washington post that in the last two months, with belarus has made few classified operations, to eliminate 187 pounds of weapons on the basis of uranium from the Belarusian research facilities.
It paved the way for wednesday's agreement to end the rest of the material - about to 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity, because it is a sensitive issue.
The deal has proved to be one of the most important outcomes Obama's of 47 nation summit on nuclear security in the April, which was belarus vyřazeno.
And it was probably a good move to secure an invitation former Soviet republics at a subsequent summit of 2012.
"I was truly fascinate the fact that he wants a place at the summit on nuclear bezpečnosti2012."
"This shows that process is working," said Ken Luongo, the president of the partnership for global security, a group that supports nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement as a " highly significant, important step" from belarus.
Obama has promised to Prague for a 2009 that will ensure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in four years.
Since then, the government has helped six countries to get rid of all highly obohaceného supply of uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
Dozens of countries have done so in the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time the obama summit on nuclear security, said Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko that his nation will never give up uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially a basis for weapons and less enriched uranium," he said after Lukashenko.
"It is our commodity... we are not going to make a dirty bomb, and we are not going to sell anyone."
"We use it only for research purposes, that is all."
Belarus still, a few months ago, joined the United States and has shown interest in reaching an agreement.
The first pledge to remove the Belarusian uranium during October, was particularly difficult because the material was slightly radiated, said officials.
He was charged at a special train, which travelled more than 1 miles to 300 Russian equipment for the storage and disposal, officials said.
A second operation was shut on Monday and was a flight, officials said.
The American government for the scheme has spent 13 million dollars, most of it on the birth of Belarusian research body less enriched uranium, which is to produce nuclear weapons it does not fit.
"Everything was very carefully coordinated and controlled on the basis of trust" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the department of energy's working for the Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin center for studies on nuclear non-proliferation this year estimated that belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium available to produce weapons.
Belarus will be under a joint declaration to seek the removal of stores to 2012.
Relations between belarus and the United States were for years, tense, primarily due to Lukašenkově brutal suppression of human rights.
But wednesday's announcement suggests the possibility the gradual melting.

The Spanish government did not do so with the CIA flights of the expensiveness
The Spanish government did not do the expensiveness on flights převážejících imprisoned talibance and members Al-Qaida to guantánamo via the Spanish territory, as in a telegram an envoy of the United States in Madrid.
So it is clear from the documents given by Wikileaks, the server of newspaper El País, where he also writes that by the time the first representative of premier Fernándezová María Teresa de la Vegová has requested that the Spanish officials say, "can show that it has adequate supervision of foreign aircraft prolétajícími Spanish airspace."
2006 June, after a message from the Council of Europe, in which he was accused in a dozen states, including Spain to attend a violation of human rights, meeting took place between the us ambassador, Eduard Aguirre and Fernándezovo de la Vegovou.
A representative of prime minister said that the message of the Council of Europe "vyňalo Zapaterovu government from the game" and insisted that Spain is not in fact something to hide.
De la Vegová pointed out that Spain has no problem with the years of the secret services through its territory.
"They simply want to just be aware" that they were not "zastiženi not ready," he informs Aguirre in one of the papers.
Also, the then Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos indicated the u.s ambassador that the Spanish government "wants to give the fact that the lowest possible contours, but that this matter was in the hands of judges, the administration had limited ability to influence."
2007, the prosecutor Vicente González embassy was informed that if it does not intend to block the initiative by judge to ask for the declassification of documents national centre of the secret services (DEMAND) and the department of Defense on flights.
"This information contains no inkriminovanou ingredient or any sensitive information," explained embassy after a conversation with the prosecutor.
However, the us have expressed concern rather because of " apparent co-ordination between Spanish judge and German prosecutors" than because of the declassification of information DEMAND or the department of Defense.
"This coordination among independent judges will complicate our efforts to resolve the case diskrétně between governments, regrets" Aguirre.
2007 March on the occasion of lunch, the us ambassador and interior minister Alfredo Péreze Rubalcaby, told the ambassador that "despite being Spanish judges very jealous of independence, and they will do what they consider to be appropriate," commissioned for the staff, "will avoid rozohněným commentary with a plan to reduce tensions."
Ambassador also expressed concern about holding the party Partido Popular (PP. Czech people's party - pozn. překl.) on this matter.
"In spite of its popular focus proamerickou us our experience is that Partido Popular will not hesitate to use any indications that Zapaterova government tolerated or intentionally ignoring the action by the us, which could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, even in the event that the revelations could have negative consequences for the United States Government," he notes.

Populists would get in the house and of 4 seats (PSC Socialist Party Catalonia - pozn. překl.) would lose 9 mandates
with results from 28 of the PP could be the watchword at the town halls in Léridě, Tarragoně and Barcelona.
Following a significant increase and gained votes in the number of experienced members during the recent autonomous elections, katalánská PP (people's party - pozn Catalonia. překl.) already has a picture of a general election, there will be an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in a nation-wide elections is usually one such compared to the polls katalánských.
during 2008, won katalánští the populists in the general election of 610.473 votes, while in the elections of of 2006, this figure was just 316,222.
Past Sunday won (PPC people's party Catalonia) 384.091 votes.
Uphold-whether this trend is increasing, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of their constituents, the PP analysts of this party has calculated that if be held general elections, PPC could house 12 members compared with the current 8, the CiU (Convergencia and Unió, Czech agreement and union - pozn. překl.) would win also mandates (4 of them would now have 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (now has 25).
These estimates, would confirm that Katalánsko for the PP party (PSOE and Spanish socialist workers' party) essential.
According to an analysis of populists the ERC (left-wing Republican Party Catalonia - pozn. překl.) lost one member - now has 3 - while ICV (green initiative for Katalánsko - pozn. překl.) in the future would have a mandate or would get even one another.
However, under electoral calendar will be the next venue to host in the 2011 at the local elections, where he could also have a populist decisive influence at the end of the dominance of the socialists in four major provincial cities and also to changes in the draft Barcelona (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the largest award with a projected budget - eur 661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and populists agree with the possibility that PSC could lose town halls in Barcelona, Tarragoně, Léridě and Geroně where the socialists would not take a majority and neither can not resort to traditional ally, the party ERC and ICV.
It was not impossible, given the debacle of Republicans if the party lost its representation in Barcelona corporation - because we need to win at least 5% votes.
The PP increased the number of votes won in four capitals and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Léridě and Tarragoně.
The nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in turning point in Tarragoně, where they govern with the PP before the current mayor, Josepem Félixem Ballesterosem.
in Léridě PP won by only 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Angel of dew has a very good relationship with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign has on several occasions gathered.
Populists get on another major town halls as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
currently the PP has representation in 34 town halls in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as communities.
Katalánská entire said the organisation - qaeda of thousands of passports
In addition to the seven detained in Barcelona, was arrested three more in Thailand
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerijec, who was arrested by agents general information komisařství in Barcelona, has created a mobile džihádistickou controlled from Thailand, which organised the passports of various sections of the organisation - qaeda, among them was also the " liberation tigers of tamil Ílamu" or " Lashkar-e-Taiba," while the latter group was the author of the efforts in mumbai in which 2008 were killed 106 people.
The interior ministry attaches an investigation into this matter of great importance, basically, in order to provide through " operation Kampai" weakening padělatelského of apparatus - qaeda internationally and "to limit so its operational capacity."
Investigators estimate that the entire could within two years when he was active in Catalonia, to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where he had been forged and then add groups that make up the galaxy of criminal organisation - qaeda that their fighters "with impunity" could travel across borders in Europe and other western countries.
This rozbitá mobile was not the only active, who had a network of jihad in Europe, and therefore the investigation outside thailand services were involved, other European police unit, and it is not possible to rule out that in the coming days will not happen in other European countries, such intervention, as it was in Barcelona last night Tuesday.
In connection with the operation (when they were detained by Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Mohammad Ahmad, Saddique Nuclear Begum, Tanveer Arshad, Nigerijec Babatunde Agunbiade) has been developed in Thailand another, at which were captured the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
It was precisely these men who steered from Bangkoku whole residing in Spain and another in other European countries.
Katalánská network, which was destroyed during 2009, particularly kradla tourists passports, which meets the demands of Islamists.
This means that the documents should belongs men aged between of 25 and 45, they have to have a force for several years and be vyznačených without a visa.
In investigative documents is stressed that so far they are not aware of any facts that would combine the detainees from Catalonia to the attempt in mumbai, although the author of such attacks, Lashkar-e-Taiba '" he must have been one of the group who received passports stolen in Spain and then falsifikované in Thailand.
However, it is worth pointing out that a few days before the attempt was sent from Catalonia of transfer agency about a thousand dollars, which was " spot" for the purchase of the cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the " commando" who killed 106 people.
Police have seized much evidence.
Popular party (PP) asks for Masovi to halt the convention
The chair of the PPC (people's party Catalonia) Alicia Sánchezový-Camachová yesterday had a chance to present himself Arturovi Masovi conditions under which it is willing to support its submission to the office of the president; Generalitat such conditions are consistent with those proposed during the campaign and their priority is economic recovery and renouncing risky businesses as the economic agreement that want a leader to propose nationalists during its mandate.
The chairman katalánských of populists arrived for a meeting with Arturem meat with certainty of of 18 parliamentary seats received in elections from past Sunday, a number more than satisfactory to gain popularity, so CiU a candidate needs to get at least one of the establishment forming opposition abstain on his substitution to the office.
For a possible agreement with PP hang a possible alliance that would like the nationalists in parliament to keep it when they will hold a general election, but so far the talks, which leads the meat with the rest of political leaders, take in katalánském spirit.
As for the PP in order to get his support for the submission to the office, "will have to do away with all the sovereign and the speeches," as with economic agreement - like that of the Basque Country - about which wanted the leader of the CiU and to let them vote in the referendum.
Both leaders would like to reduce the rampant political apparatus of administrative autonomy and reduce inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Masova the submission to the office will address within the party PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.

The director of facilities geriatrického affirms that the deaths were due to " lack of action"
The presentation of the centre Olot do not rule out that their carers have killed more than 11 clients
The administration geriatrického of the centre de La Caritat Olot (Gerona) said yesterday's press conference to describe what the damage caused by the institution criminal behaviour Joana Vily Dilmé, carers, who - mezitímco has been busy - have killed at least eleven elderly people who had in custody.
The director of a home for the elderly in Joana Sal went to escort the lawyer of equipment, attorney Joana of Canada, and said that "the desire of La Caritat home would be able to make allegations against the culprit" responsible for the killings, but "the rule of law and accountability obliges us leave this process relevant authorities."
Apart from damaging the reputation that the institution can suffer because of that, in time, did not show the criminal activities of carers major threat to the home La Caritat are now demands for material compensation, which has calculated the attorneys for the families mourner.
Joana Vila Dilmé admitted that his initial crime, udál as far back as 2009, and that did not stop killed since then
Judges ordered the exhumation of eight people for clients to home for the elderly with suspicion that in many cases have not seen any zemřelé doctor personally, but that - given the age and poor health of patients - everything was pass over the phone.
La Caritat yesterday by the director, resolutely rejected this extreme and stressed that "the lack of action could not be in any case, the reason that occurred."
Attorney La Caritat added that "where there are no indications that outside their own accused of any third party committed errors."
Now the man nicknamed the " angel of death" admitted yesterday the 11 killing and stipulated that the first crime was committed. 29, 2009 and a month and a half later, he killed another grandma.
in this case caused the death of passes too high doses of insulin, unlike the first case when you use a mixture of reassuring capsules.
Director of La Caritat to this indicated that it is difficult to control the attitude of staff to medicines.
Insulin and cocktail of sedatives were probably in six of the nine cases means that the carers used to make patients killed in an attempt to free them from suffering.
But only the analyses that now we would be in the laboratory, they should tell if villa does not lie and actually seek first victim less cruel death or have instead killed by a lye, as has confessed to the case of three women killed between 12 and 17. by October.
in La Caritat believes zdravotníkovým by claiming and they do not rule out that the number of those killed may be higher than what was admitted, and they justify operation in various versions, which gave the villa to court in the knowledge that must change talks, when it became clear that killed eight people.
As a result, they say they want to be the judiciary in hand, to osvětlen entirety of the matter.
The European Central Bank is threatening
Investors reacted sharply yesterday at yesterday's threat, presidenta the ecb's Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to respond."
Frontier differentials locked by violence and European shares of banks has fallen by more than 5%.
But it also should not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to err - the Euro has just stepped over critical importance.
This was what yesterday, is typical of illiquid market, which, although there is a downturn, recuperates, but thanks to a short and very speculative positions.
Investors for some time, it will take before they lose their concerns.
A month ago, the European Central Bank cited that today has withdrawn the rate of liquidity, and tomorrow will be back for the fourth time in two years to retracted.
Bundesbank has demanded an end to plan for the repurchase of government debt to inefficiency and the elimination of all emergency liquidity measures in the period and to leave unlimited access only for one week.
We expected after the Irish crisis that the level of liquidity will predict "minimally" to March and will hold an auction of three-month unrestricted access to the end of the trimestru to provide liquidity to at least June.
We also hope that in the future they will continue its program of buying bonds and even report it intensified.
Nenaplní-whether created expectations, will create this again, the reaction of the markets from yesterday and, if still blindly will continue downloading measure of liquidity, God with us!
This was equivalent to congress during May, where he claimed that they were not considering buying bonds and got into the collapse of the market - tomorrow could history repeat.
The European Central Bank must be credible and consistent.
in it he said the armored fist on Monday and Wednesday reported that they already have purchased many, causing the collapse of the market.
Yesterday's auction of posters in one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro has issued only 500 million for 5,28%, compared with 750 million for 4,81% from the previous auction.
By then, rates in Portugal they fell down about 30 points below, racketing so a change of mood in the market that occurred after the words Trichet.
in Ireland were published figures represent losses, Allied and bank of Ireland.
Estimated amounts represent some 10.000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15.000, to February have a chance to become private equity, otherwise they will be zestátněny.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after the July issue did not show stresovými tests are part in helping plan an affordable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, further Tuesday it will require the government to gain the approval of new budget in parliament and still does not have enough support, so in Ireland in the future rules uncertainty.
Angela Merkel ease the tone of discourse to release tension in the face for the next meeting of the leaders of the eu's 14 conference., which is necessary to achieve political compromise that would show that we are union and everything is in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagnera, while others rather Beethovenovu ode to joy.
In Spain, the prime minister yesterday the opportunity to present a plan of action that will be passed on to the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform and transparency in the autonomous regions and financial institutions, reducing the deficit, liberalisation and privatisation, measures to boost employment - to uší investors it sounds like a four time of the year from Vivaldiho.
Dual effect of Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish stock market has risen by 4,5%, then doubly than other European exchanges.
Unlike February was the response from the government and the Spanish national bank's speedy and conclusive - we probably benefit from the scope of surprises.
Today we have a crucial auction of bond for three years, to be zvýhodněna of Trichet, therefore, we hope, after it will be a big demand that helps to dispel the doubts about refinancing our performance.
To request a rescue plan would be to Spain self-devotion.
It would give the us treasury that we do not need - in El Tesoro is available to 40.000 million in cash, three times more than March - the next high rates and market access, concluded a sine die.
However, we need to continue to use the strategy Cesarovy of women - " not only is this, but it zdáti."
We will do it.

Russwurm says that during 1992, occupied the stables average of 10 engineers who have been able to do no more than three or four improvements in one season.
the team dilute Bull, is working today to 180 young highly skilled professionals equipped effective information technology, who analysed and they propose any type of modification competing vehicles.
Manager for Siemens explained that PLM software is able to analyse and improving all the elements of a competing vehicle dilute Bull with the exception of the engine, for which he is responsible Renault.
Is gm materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features.
Changes can be extracted from virtual reality to the truth in less than 24 hours due to advanced production systems support for laser and highly technologically advanced autokláv.
The only by restrict these technical achievement is part of of 40 million dollars, representing the maximum that can each team from Formula One issued for each period on improving the competitiveness.
Dilute Bull has raised approximately 50 km from london - the race cutting-edge technologies used to design and manufacture of competitive cars.
They are two buildings, which is restricted the entry of visitors - particularly journalists.
All that is going on here, is seen as a " big secret."
The list zúčastěných of the project reads 580 people, including the two pilots - winner Vettela and Marek Webbera.
The hero is dilute Bullu in Formula One without a doubt, juvenile winner Sebastian Vettel.
For enormous technological means that the energy drink brand invested in participating in competitive circles, of course, they hide other supporters, whose support is invaluable, and at the same time, nobody knows.
The main manufacturing technology Nevey Steve says that five years ago was possible to say that advances in research and development of vehicles have contributed to the victory of 50% and the rest was due to riders.
at the moment, that relationship has changed and technology stand behind the success of the 85% pilots, while contributing 15% percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber will never be nahrazeni computer technology, as they are "nepředvídatelní gladiators."

Sabadell bets on what "" in three years bidders million clients
More optimistic than other bosses, delegated council member of the bank Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be for the bank demanding, but rejects a new crisis liquidity and predicting the end of a passive war.
However, count on a reduction in interest rates, but we will try to make up for slevněním banking fees and the cost of credit.
Sabadell expects he will succeed in three years to gain millions of private clients.
Sabadell have found a way to use the next three years and performance, and to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The bank will launch 2011 new strategic plan in place for three years.
The aim is, in addition to survive without the need to go to public support in the FROB, to gain market share podchycením million new private clients - i.e 700.000, subtract-whether those who eventually will leave the bank - because until now the ai constitution rather spoiled small and medium-sized businesses and large businesses than retail clients.
This year has already won the of 250.000 private banking clients and of 50.000 businesses.
Its market share is about 3,5% private clients, while customer service that is more than 10%.
Another of the fundamental ideas of the 2011-2013 is a commitment to creativity, or it could be said, chastity, in order to reduce costs, the challenge will highlight the bank when it will provide results for the period.
Not many banking institutions, then dares to set goals and to publish them, as the financial crisis changed all plans world banking.
Sabadell this year will close the agenda of the best, set out four years ago, although it was initially for three years, but the market situation has claimed extension for another term.
Clients who will leave from the savings-banks, it will be their main target group.
At a meeting pořádané APIE Guardiola has insisted that 2011 will be "difficult and very important."
Indeed, he believes that way out of the crisis in Spain "will be protracted."
In addition, it will be for two or three years "very hard to create employment" for the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And while believe that passive war - which reduces margins - pushes back the cost of the extra fees for the risk that the banks and savings banks pay for emissions to take liquidity, have already moved to the price of credit, which offset by lower margins.
"The issue of liquidity and funding is structural and will present nátlakový factor on credit."
"We have not yet reached tap, but differentials are very high," acknowledged Guardiola.
Banesto already published online on Thursday requires us to have been reduced extended credit and increased the price differentials - see CincoDías from 22 to 27. November.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "it is now down by the commission," but there is a "competitive framework."
Strategic plan for the bank Sabadell is based on organic growth, as usual, the group does not preclude corporate operations.
Not nadarmo affirms that "in Spain they will demand greater proportions."
"Next year will not stay on kameni stone," sure.
It confirms that the need for capital are "much diminished" and did not rule out that some of the Spanish institutions will come between the red.
And it shows that FROB could to stand in the collection of the funds before a new measure of capital.
After assurances that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, continues to pose a serious problem that some bankers are predicting a new crisis of liquidity.
Notes that can not be disclosed but, contrary to what was June, it is possible to take short-term funding through the repo rate, which alleviates crisis.

"I believe that most mergers have already been implemented, inkorporaci Cajasolu to the Banca Cívica can not be considered a second round, what is happening is agreement."
"The majority is completely done; it is possible that room of 17 of the constitution we go down to 13 or 14, but all major trials are already preparing and under the protection of the Spanish national bank, which in this matter has worked very well," said director.
In a statement at the association (ADEA of managers and executive officers of Aragonu - pozn. překl.) Olavarrieta described that the process of concentration is held, "the highest speed and we have to be very satisfied, as is demonstrated in repayments from time, not now, found in commercial plans with the Spanish national bank" he stressed.
"To go from 45 savings-banks with the average volume of assets of of 28.000 million to 17 million, with 75.500 is a process that has no history of comparison, redukujíce a number of institutions to 62% so that the latter were bigger and thus in accordance with the treaty, underline."
Olavarrieta recognised that "there is a lot not too happy opinions about the slowness of the process," which shows a " lack of seriousness and sensitivity," because "what does the Spanish national bank is připomínání that we must be before the end of the year in the term."
Director - general José Antonio CECA Olavarrieta yesterday that Spain has the highest financial system across Europe, and " probably" and in the world, and to those who doubt that, given the " lack of knowledge."
The director noted that while benign economic times, we can "be quiet" on financial institutions and savings-banks and a system that zvládnul " very important" the process of concentration and which continues " the highest possible speed."
Also remember that the Spanish banking emerged well from stresových tests carried out by the European Central Bank during July.
Zapatero and red German lines
Berlin has decided to keep the Euro, but setting the conditions for the entire union.
Tensions in the markets prompted double the government's response.
On the one hand, suggested José Luis Zapatero new adaptation measures, from tax cuts to small and medium-sized businesses, over the regulation of private zprostředkovacích agencies or cancellation of of 426 euros for the unemployed with no benefits, after privatisation 49% (AENA Spanish airports and air traffic control - pozn. překl.), the stewards Barajas airport and El to wash and 30% national lottery.
Elena Salgadová vice - president with the support of former premier Felipa González, on the other hand joined the criticisms about chancellor Angela Merkel because of its responsibility for starting the current crisis.
How to read this emotion?
So be it in advance, say that view Merkel is not a mistake in its communication policies.
On the contrary, it is the next in a complicated process redefinice of the Euro.
And Germany has a radically new vision of what is expected to be his future, which affects on the idea of keeping the old traditions that adheres to much of the rest.
In the face of European opposition in Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first would represent a strong Euro zone, which would be exactly Germany, but also for example, Austria and the netherlands, while southern states currency zone left.
The second is returning to the mark - although now it may seem like scifi, this version has broad public support, the approaching 50% people.
A third option, according to German proposals by adapting the Euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary rigour, with fines for reprehensible states, possible delay in payments for some of them, and with the expansion potential cost of regulating the private sector.
Germany's position is clear and for some time is limited, so for now shifts there is no room.
First, though, in the year 2009, the international monetary fund and the European Commission has initiated by deficits, from the sleeve of the German government's constitutional reform to them, of 2016 block.
It was the first sign of a mismatch between what he considered Germany as well (it plans a fiscal rigour and stability of public finances), and that he used his European partners, including France.
Another showed the central - european country, when Merkel painfully draged out a decision on rescuing Greece.
Even then he was subjected to fierce criticism, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also released, were strongly opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the final October days, Merkel again emerged with a clear view when he called for reform of the eu so that it easier for rescuing a member state, while for us to have private lenders having to take part in costs.
That view was interpreted as anti-european, which precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat zmírněné the form, was approved, and during the coming months, they should watch the reform process, which would have between 2013 to facilitate this measure.
Germany has set a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And all told us that although we now need to take action, which apparently is not agree, since that date will be working with old has ended.
2013 Will be a birth of a new currency zone, will be the state infringing rules tough sanctions in which even they may be forced to announce an extension of payments and private sector will also have to shoulder part of the cost.
Germany has indicated that we must make tough road to growth, increasing the rate of savings and investments, moderate consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Other options based on the debt and the building, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, which reigned during the years of the boom of growth in Spain, they simply are not going to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And they would make a mistake if they did not understand.
It is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in the year 2013.
What they like for us, it is much harder.
And the worst thing is that we could happen in these conditions that he will make a mistake.
I hope that the current turbulence will replace more calm.
And we will take the opportunity in which to give us the spring of 2013.
It seems that prime minister Zapatero has also drawn and his double statements (for reform slíbené after a meeting with the big business of past Saturdays and yesterday's announcement of the new measures) gives suspect that, despite the criticism about Merkel has opened the way for the idea that we need to put things in order.
But red line, which Germany has set, it was, and it does not seem that it wanted to move.
And since the options can be observed, can not be leaving the Euro area full of not very good countries to exclude above.
Well, the us will always be able to say that the us has warned.
Sport and the circumvention of the standard
Trick, which it demonstrated Alonso and Ramos in the fight Ajaxem, shows wit not plan to escape punishment.
Supposedly zosnovaná the exclusion of two players of real Madrid (Xabiho Alonsa and Sergia Ramos in the battle of the champions league by a Ajaxu from 23 to November caused that was vypsáno the sea of ink on whether it is or is not a sporting behaviour and, if possible, UEFA have not had both footballer to punish.
As we know, a few minutes before the end of the match (which had their team clearly vyhraný) designated players one by one they deliberately lost time when he had rozehrávat foul to persuade a judge to them has shown a second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet prescribed punishment in the fight against Auxerre - apart from real Madrid will finish in a group at the top - and it will be able to get rid of cards, to progress to the next stage.
Eventually awarded the disciplinary board trainer UEFA to punish José Mourinhovi to two matches and reprehensible players receive a financial penalty.
Vyprovokování yellow card for similar conditions is no new practice, but is more or less in football.
It is so widespread that is part of the ethos of football, then the rules, which are not written, but they are watching.
Part of the debate in this case arose because its participant team was real Madrid (which, in the anthem boast šlechetností and honour, and for similar actions of player revenged) and, it seems, also thanks to the drama led Mourinhem that is added to a long history of comedian and instigator of the next episode.
in any case, the whirls around whether this kind of business that is not the rules expressly forbidden, is contrary to the principles of sport, so if these acts are circumventing the law; it truly is a sporting events which respects the rule that sense, of course, it seems, is trying to circumvent.
It is clear what sort of damage such behaviour is causing sporting spirit.
One of the procedures sporting behaviour is the physical integrity of opponents who were not in these cases break, so there was a violent game.
Another of those procedures charakterizujících net game is to avoid players through offence should a team of enemy benefit - which is also not occurred.
Then, in the event of a player of real Madrid is that this did not happen that we normally characterised as a gimmick or the circumvention of law, there was no hidden breach of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this was going to be the most noticeable in order to receive a punishment.
We wait and would like to receive a punishment.
Another question is, what benefits the guilty of wilful infringement will have.
Here is important to note that the opponent not get to disadvantaged position, and that in the current fight will not do any good, since obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And even that is not useful strategy to another fight, as the club will not be able to these players to count.
Obviously the advantage is that the players will begin the next phase of the champions league by without a card that could jeopardise their future involvement in combat.
But it is the benefit from a long-term perspective, and with some degree of vagueness, at first glance it may be a team eliminován, and besides, this action has odbudou player a penalty, and move on to the second round of the card, in which the exclusion makes one card less than at the helm of the first.
So how will the wheels continues, it will not be entirely clear whether it is an advantage.
By and large, that debate is not about sporting a spirit that part of it is making a strategic decision that will allow them to gain maximum benefit under the rules.
in the event that we are dealing here, did not have the players to avoid awarding of a penalty (which would be a clear case of circumventing the rules), but rather choose when to subdue him.
They made a strategic decision, without avoid punishment or before they ran.
Although there is no border between the wit and the circumvent the rules are very clear, I believe that in this case clearly this was a wit.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because they were two samovyloučení and because of the manner in which there was a lesson to transfer them vyprovokování from the administration.
The impairment of sporting principles of these negotiations is not so the moral is aesthetic.
The battle of offers on having a Christmas party in Barcelona
The diktat of the focus this year avalanche reserves at 16. and 17. Decembers.
Rapidly increasing its celebrations hrazených the very employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As well as Turkish honey or lottery, with the arrival of December, christmas parties are still acts as kyslíková the bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but through the crisis has resulted in the battle to acquire customers price reductions. nearly all they want for food to spend 20 to 30 euros, they agree dotázaní entrepreneurs and associations from this sector.
To complete the complication of numbers, concentrated calendar this year (when Christmas Eve and on Friday) request for a week from 13 December, which was created avalanche reserves for days in the tip (of 16 and 17), while in the previous week was hardly any traffic.
How is this going back to 2008, when it began thin years, there are many firms that collectively parties from a budgetary reasons cancelled.
Not to abandon tradition, many employees are paid útratu on the parties out of their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many are asking price on the fringes of capacity, suggesting the president of the restaurant Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
A Representative of patronage restaurant equipment at the moment does not dare to predict what will be celebrating this month.
"People have this goodwill twice before they make a reservation."
"They want to be coming out, but on the subject of prices, are cautious," it adds.
Shops will be going well, "which would offer quality and good service for good price," says even remembers that customers have tended to be a degree, thanks to the crisis, most customers now wishes to spend around 25 euros.
Research facilities in various shows that the greatest strain of application for bookings are on the evening of of 17. Decembers.
The Soteras reports a real boom by booking on Friday, with the most requests are on útraty to 30 euros, which gm nabízená currency, whose overall prices are 25 percent to 30 euros.
in another big company, which is Andilana, numbering 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, market, La fund and others), brought a speciality of this year's calendar more early reserves and this from the start of November.
"We have done the impossible possible and to keep prices from last year, and our currency, which had to pick anyone who range from 19,95 to 30 euros," they say.
In group A of the group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, and a total QuQu reads 23 companies, they remain optimistic after they recorded from the second half of the increase in profits and have a relatively solid prospects for Christmas revenue.
The sources of this company stressed that also 18. December will be vytíženým the day since they will be celebrating christmas with friends.
in six group added the currency peg Christmas, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as noted, compared with the previous year, the tendency of visitors to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine - pozn. překl.).
She also noted that there are companies that once again they invited employees, and it seems that the size of the crowds are a little more.
The company's Vicepresident Fecasarm (which include institutions such as the association of bars, restaurant and leisure centres in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes it is beginning to see the end of the tunnel, claiming that the number of bookings, "" revived, although clients ' contracts to the maximum."
That impression either during Christmas celebrations would not back down, pays who pays points.
Pakistan nuclear program created major unrest in the us.
Islámábád they produce atomic weapons " a faster rate than any other country."
Wikileaks documents confirm links between talibánci and Pakistan.
The contents of correspondence between the embassies of the United States in Pakistan and the Foreign office, published by Wikileaks confirms portal extraordinary turmoil that Washington gives pakistan nuclear program.
Besides objasňujících and significant details, which offer on the content of the communications and the thoughts of Representatives - american diplomacy in Islamabad, reveals that those documents that cooperation between the two states when it comes to nuclear security, instead, to increase, "is on the retreat," and that this fragile Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state."
The peculiarity of pakistani nuclear program - that its weapons are not called, but are imposed after work to be znesnadněna their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for the vigilance of Washington.
It calculates Ambassadresses in Pakistan, Anne W. Pattersonová in one report before a visit by the time an adviser to the national security: James Jones " the proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under the control of the taliban, the supposed dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of transport nuclear materials."
The increased number of people connected with the nuclear arsenály and with the agenda of guided missiles is no longer considered only the us, but also by Russia, as šířící, and representing reasons to be wary.
"Pakistan should protect nuclear facilities to hire staff with strong religious faith. due to the decline in the level of education and culture has an extremist organisations more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear programs or programmes for guided missiles," said specialist Jurij Korolev of russia Foreign office for a meeting with counterparts from the us.
The biggest news of documents published by the server of Julian Assangeho is becoming less co-operation between the us and Pakistan over the issues of nuclear arms and increased movement of pakistan extraction of such weapons.
Dispatches issued by the embassy for May, which qualifies communications with Pakistan as " frustrating," says: " "Transparence often do not exist; offers of assistance remain unanswered or fall."
in other news, Peter Lavoy worker, the national intelligence service for South Asia that "despite the economic disaster produces the Pakistan nuclear weapons as fast as any other state in the world."
Ambassadresses Pettersonová also ask Washington to during a visit by the head of the army, general Ashfaqa Kayaniho, "explained very good" that "pakistan's army must break with tacit support of terrorist groups."
Hunt on the main Wikileaks
Obama names a highly postaveného the worker responsible for fighting terrorism to avoid the new tax information.
Interpol is issuing a " red challenge" in order to monitor and determine where Assange could be.
All about Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assangeho make up the complex maze, where it is hard to be sure the facts.
Interpol announced yesterday " unprecedented challenge," the so-called dilute announcement, k "lokalizování and monitoring of movement" Assangeho.
But it is not a classic order for the arrest.
Beyond this, the challenge is not new, but dates back to 20. November.
And it does not have to deal with the latest leak more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with allegations of sexual abuse by Australan faces in Sweden.
In addition, make sure the counsel of Wikileaks designer Mark Stephens, "police know where and how to be contacted with Mr Assangem."
There were 20. November, when the international police force based in the French Lyonu published this order at the request of Sweden, has not disclosed, but until yesterday, when it received permission from Swedish authorities.
Against this background, the 188 countries of Interpol proposals for identification or location Assangeho "in order to impose on him temporary custody and to publish it."
Although Interpol can not order the arrest of the person who comes to the red challenge, many member states, both organisations explained, but they see the so-called dilute the announcement for allowing the arrests to be made - it must be provided by the national component of the police - especially in the event that they have a mutual agreement states on extradition of detainees, as would be the case with Sweden and England, where he apparently had Assange to be found.
The move Assengeho scandalised by the attorneys who yesterday issued a notice of where claims that 39-year-old the founder of Wikileaks has shown a willingness to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by videoconference.
Remember, too, that Assenge asked and then received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of the case, which they compare with legendary Lavrentijem Pavlovičem Berijou, the main stalin's security.
"This is not a hunt and legal persecution," suggests letter.
While it the whole world is looking for - from Australia and her mother defends the innocence of a son - Assange is next on unfamiliar ground, of course, is not silent.
on Monday, giving via Skype from unknown location interview the editor of the magazine Tim - in that conversation demanded the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States Hillary Clinton.
"Point-whether, he was responsible for the regulation and the us to carry out spying in the united nations and so we have broken international conferences, which the United States signed, should remove" he said.
His view was yesterday rejected a Press secretary for the White House, Robert Gibbs, who qualified the requirement to step - down as " ridiculous and absurd."
"I would not be entirely sure why we should depend on the opinion of the individual that operates a website," he said on CNN.
Obama has entrusted by a highly postaveného a worker in charge of counterterrorism, Rusella Traverse to prevent further leaks of documents.
A spokesman for president Barack Obama to stop adding Assangemu on the importance of contrasts with those who proclaim recently, conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, a member of Congress who for January will chair the committee on national security in the commons, he asked the Foreign Ministry to examine options include Wikileaks between terrorist organisations "in order to intervene and prosecute everyone who helped them financially or otherwise provide assistance."
Further went this Flanagan, the adviser, Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper, who said that Assange would have to be "killed," which in turn should be repealed.
"Obama on him should copy of retribution or to use pilotless aircraft or something like that."
He did not apologise, was Mike Huckabee, baptistický priest, a former guvernátor Arkansasu and possible presidential candidate.
"No one will be in government, whoever is responsible for the leak of information would be guilty of betrayal and any other sentence than the execution would be too mild," said on the Fox station
Puigcercós is seeking to ERC calm " pomrkáváním" on the supporters Caroda
Republican leaders will allow hand a secret ballot on inertia.
Huguet suggests more plurální officials and the end schůzovního of the system.
Joana Puigcercós seem to have found a formula for how to contend with whether několikátou internal revolt among the ERC (left-wing Republican Party Catalonia - pozn. překl.), fruitless because of the loss of of 11 members and half the votes.
The leader of the party is aware that his gesture on the resignation appears to the followers of former leader Josepa Lluíse Caroda-Roviry inadequate, and also knows that the impact of the sector is now so weakened as it its leader, and it absolutely can not do such a concern that had with other zaniklými currents.
It will be the leader of the Left to try to get new criticism of support pomrkávání that will help obrnit in local elections.
First Puigcercós yesterday announced that more than 200 members of the national committee will be able secretly to pay him to stay in office.
Through ballot paper, not a show of hands.
If they want supporters Caroda to convey president criminal voice and able to do without fear of reprisals.
In fact they want to avoid boss division and the achievement of man.
in several interviews that he did not regard for potvrzeného with half the votes and one in addition, it added, without setting percent, also was not a good result "after Bulgaria."
Supporters Caroda ask the president more than to have work available - which it considers a gesture that has no weight, as Puigcercós checks at congresses the largest body.
But given that do not have sufficient majority to force resignations, will attempt by officials to remember the plan from now on until May.
Because of the expectation is that it will participate in the drafting of the text on a strategic reorientaci which will give guidance to the National Council of 18. day in the month.
Their goal is to promote Puigcercóse in exchange for what it promised Congress has already transferred the autumn of 2011.
The ERC announced that " mnohohlasnost" harms stability, and that its aim is that, once and for all, the organization was able to wash dirty or behind closed doors.
in this context seems to be the rule that the current adviser, Josep Huguet signed on a blog.
After he took into account Puigcercósův ideologue, a consultant for innovation has a fait accompli that leaders will be confirmed by the " exchange for a couple of goals."
And those listed five, from which go beyond two.
The first is " překomponování" executives so that were at least 90% members that means embracing a new faces who are from the sector in favour Carodovi.
The second goal may be big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC has been completely put schůzovnictvím as a mechanism of operation.
And so is fighting for a reform of the constitution in order to perform Congresses through the delegates selected by the vote.
Skoncování with the model schůzovního in the system, except in the Spanish system of political parties is intended the aim Puigcercósova of the team which, in this direction, fought in the last two congresses.
However, convulsive meeting of of 2008 determined that schůzovnictví must be posouzeno for special of Congress on reforms of the constitution.
The issue is still unfinished, because the situation inside the part discouraged from the resolution of this matter.
Now, without číhajících critical sectors could be a good moment again this is to come and try him once and loved ones.

The report was published after the 42 Republican Senators threatened to block the approval of any law, if it is not approved extension of cutting taxes from the Bush era and finance minister.

Santistický stratég, as a trainer to reach his first final at the tournament aperture 2002, when he was in the hands of a club with Morelia, who was born in total to 4-2 against Toluce; then, in the tournament 2003 Clausura again moved to a duel and it also lost with the overall scores of 3-1, which was against a team Rayados.
Already with the club Santos lagoon in the tournament Torneo Bicentenario 2010, again against " Ďáblům" from Toluky, Rubén again suffered losses, even though his team playing against the butchers " pork" (another nickname club Deportivo Toluca - pozn. překl.) after 210 minutes of the game, irresolutely 2-2, after a series of punitive shootings happened to benefit of three to one and had two chances to seal the title, but ultimately his three players slipped from 11 steps and the team so he had turnover at 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the " red ďáblům" from Toluky and one against Monterrey, its future opponent, so i avoid the same fate and got rid of a curse, and could thus, for the first time celebrating title, although she says that, for him, is the most important institution.

Do not worry him that this number could decide in criminal shootings, believes players. "You never do not try to achieve a number of penalty kicks, you try to end in normal times, but sometimes there is no other choice and it is for this to be ready, we are ready, they were sadly us but the fate of up the wrong ball, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety, which we felt was the front in our hands, but we lost him in us something left and hopefully last tournament that this time such a thing will not happen."
Romano is in the hands of a chance to stop being the second and a taste for the first time, fame, thereby bringing titles.

Quebecký radio broker Stéphane Dupont suffered a setback before the Canadian council for the rules of radio and television (RRTV) because of controversial statements made regarding the social aid and Haiťanů and, like because of rough speech during the broadcast.
The council for radio and television broadcasts think Mr Dupont and his group of 98,1 FM CHOI had a right to express their views, but some of the statements contained inaccurate information "about the social aid and false negative representation Haiťanů harsh rhetoric which does not correspond to posting vysílanému during the day."
The council also concluded that discussions about suicide, including the posting of the name of the two people, who were picked life, did not violate regulations for posting.
The council for radio and television broadcasts received several complaints about the comments, made during a posting, posted between of 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after the complaint common front of the recipients of social support Quebeku.
The group has complained that the amounts presented in the posting was inaccurate.
Negotiators must present a reliable information, not misleading.
As for suicide, broker Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most of the members of the commission concluded, that přenášená report was that suicide can not be viewed as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the commission believes that controversial episodes of broadcasting "Dupontových a noon news" come across a delicate topic fair and appropriate manner."
Was not it make any animadversion.
The latest dispute concerned a statement that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort then could be the media that caused many responses.
CHOI moderator announced that he would not send any offer to help Haiťanům, because we can not safely know that really need the money gets.
The commission believes that these comments were not illegal, but their cumulative effect creates an incorrect negative image Haiťanů.
"I have already redeemed my three-day suspension of this."
"My writing is no longer around one and a half years," said broker.
In all the commission's decision refusing to use in the posting rough speech.
In any case, posting CHOI-FM worked "beyond duties."
For the station, which will, among other things, to report that decision once during a major broadcaster in a period of three days, the effects are minimal.
The king of the kung fu-fuvà Montreal.
Residents of Montreal, the source of Alžíru, Nacereddine Zemmal, is extremely odd finish.
The athlete who crosses in " sandě" ("kung fu-fu full contact"), kickboxu and thailand of the box comes on tatami and the rings throughout the world and is looking for new challenges.
"I started with arts fighter as a kung fu-fu and kickbox 12 years ago in Algeria, explained Zemmal, which nymí lives in the capital of of 2008, to learn at professionals."
"In my case I look for the struggling a bit everywhere, because for those who do not like the game on a country that is detected in the combat sports are competing in a North - american precious."
Recently, a man who works as a security guard and a helper for the company UPS has just added rivals bad news when she won two gold medals at the World cup in the World karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30. October, in Edimburgu, scotland.
"I have won the category kickboxu full contact and thailand of boxes," he said.
"At the moment I prepare to China for the World Cup in san shou."
"Were invited rivals, who finished top four at the last World cup in each category."
"In Torontu during 2009, I have won bronze."
"In the year 2005 in Vietnam I was left off the eighth."
"In the year 2007 in China, I have ended up in the tournament for the fifth slight injury, while in Torontu of 2009 I have finished third," he added.
"Interestingly, in every competition I have made some progress."
"This rate I will be the first this year or next year!"
"san shou" or " sanda" it is a discipline from China, where the hits of the fist and feet, as well as the toss on the land, allowed.
Fighting traditionally occur on the platform and vzácněji in the ring.
The most famous boxer, vzešlý from this kind of fight, it is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, a well-known in the world of arts fighter.
However, Nacer Zemmal to keep in their career only one outcome will confirm their participation in bold superturnaji "King" of Sanda, Super Bowl in kung fu-fu.

"Then collision winners of each category to be crowned the winner, kung fu-fu king."
450 nasmlouvaných million without public tenders
Hydra-Québec approved by mutual agreement of of 450 million in contracts with companies that provide engineering at hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is consortium formed from companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which won the most important treaty, the treaty to control the whole project for a total of of 295 million dollars without public tenders.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance was 2004 empower alongside the choice of the company hydra-Québec that made reference to the private sector is responsible for the management of a major hydroelectric project worth of 5 billion dollars.
At the beginning of the year of 2005 "Énergie consortium gérance" win lucrative contracts with no announcement public tenders.
For Quebeckou the complaints about the consortium of companies ahead of us puts the serious problem of moral character that risk exclusion of competition and will cause rising prices.
"It is a new way to make koluzi and to dispose of the competition."
"It means that people already lateral deal is not done in secret, today there is frankly they do," said yesterday the PQ Sylvain Simard at the press conference.
A little earlier in the morning, M. Simard asked this question the National Assembly, because it says that hardly bears, how can the public interest in such sold.
Minister for natural resources, Nathalie Normandeau, in the afternoon, vigorously objected popírajíc that went on that treaty koluzi.
" I have our own way," hromovala and claimed that PQ was " unfair" and "lack precision."
He said that "this would be the least" that PQ apologised.
Prescription for the formation of a consortium is common practice in the world.
It is usually about the alliance, limitovanou at the time, enabling two or more businesses to outline their mutual expertisy to answer the call for offers for a comprehensive project.
Project Eastmain is a very difficult due to the inclusion of work.
Construction is already running and must be rozvržena to 2012.
However, it was given without the competition could act; it was a trade.
It must also be recognised that the definition of consortia is no longer in Quebeku exception, not even at a relatively simple projects.
As demonstrated last week Le Devoir, the definition of consortiums for advice in engineeringu is the subject of investigations by the government.
flying over-whether to speed the registration of the company's quebeckých of companies, will allow us to identify more than 200 consortia, and some appear to be created.
That is how society Dessau works in partnership with most major competitors; let us name CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each cocktail, and they are dozens, leads to the same legal entity, which is the Dessau.
As for the consortium Énergie gérance, secretary Normandeauová mainly underlined the fact that "territory la Baie James is a strange dynamics of labour and that hydra-Québec on it reacts already from 70 years."
The main benefactor of the project, Réal Eastmain Laporte, from energy company Baie James (SEBJ), gave an explanation, which will shrivel tie for the lead at the fact that the treaty on the management of the project was closed after mutual consent.
"If you go to a public competition and if there are few of the participants compete podávajících offer, your offered prices may be higher."
"You have a choice of two options: namely that you will find people who find themselves in this regulation as participants in the competition, and he will tell you: "Let us close to agreement satisfactory and with a good price."
"But the message is that what is important is not the price, but the competence of the people," confirmed Mr Laporte.
That treaty granted consortium Énergie gérance is part of a long list of contracts for more than 000 $ 50, who has a side Quebeku.
Contracts were signed with the company hydra-Québec or SEBJ on the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After verifying Le Devoir counted 109 contracts on the advice of the field engineeringu, concluded between 2002 and 2010, with their companies or sectors, notably in the laboratory, execution of an analysis of samples of soil.
SNC-Lavalin grabbed 22 of the treaty, Génivar of them gained 16, Tecsult Dessau 14 and 10 without having a stake in "Énergie gérance."
All contracts had been concluded.
Together they read 449 783 344 $, including contract with the company Énergie gérance to 295 $ 131 to 564.
Sylvain Simard said that four companies, which are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM) and Axor is " well - known Liberal Party Quebeku."
Ministers Normandeauová emitted news that PQ is also linked to the companies that it " funding," before he stipulated that is more about their managerial staff.
Barometer responsible consumption - " green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly sceptical.
Consumer Quebecký very little confides the players sustainable development but also " impartial" signs and environmental credentials, to under that followed in the choice of products.
The worst thing is that even if koupeme in the central area, which urges the us and urges to socially responsible consumption, mourns the media room at the lack of credible information, not fulfilling its obligations that even qualifies as a brake on pledge, says Baromètre responsible consumption that the first article came to light yesterday.
Although the 2010 increased consumption so zvaně socially responsible products, the people Quebeku who is trying to sell them, yet too believes
Two - thirds of us actually says that does not believe the promises of companies on the environment, simply because green advertizing companies, measuring tools produced by the observatory responsible consumption of the university of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumers doubts about the credibility of the official certificates, přikládaných on such products zvaně fair, but also of assurance products and brands that are identified as environmentally responsible, says barometer.
In the same way and the discussion of politics on this topic is accepted as a mere 14,6% of the population Quebeku.
Information about responsible consumption seems to be yet the original stimulus of this aspect of consumption crucial now almost a third quebeckých of consumers.
Indeed, vacuum and problematic nature of the information would soften the excitement of of 46% customers.
This is the second delay, who identified Baromètre, after the high price of these products.
After all, a third of the population Quebekuse puts distrustfully to uváděným the data on products or " green" services that we seek to let it pass by our hands.
On the other side of 2010 was almost half of consumers willing to change practices and especially to change the label one or more products that they would respond to a conviction.
All 61% have preferred shopping at the trader from their constituency and has given priority to buy food, vypěstovaných in their region, says Baromètre.
More " green" and responsible - record of responsible consumption reached 64 out of every 100 for this year - Homo consumus Québeku like gifts as the king recyclings, who is seeking the least impact on the environment by for the protection of animals.
But their social and environmental conscience has remained somewhere outside their car, says: Baromètre 2010, barely 28% people Quebeku stated that they use public transport or that they recommend using the car to a ride at least two people, for the sake of environmental protection.
Walking and cycling also supported to 39,1% participants of this extensive research in behaviour, which used a cliché.
The loan of state to the repurchase of a complex of cinemas eXcentris
The government Quebeku that we have requested financial involvement in the repurchase of a complex of cinemas eXcentris of companies Angus et le Parallèle, agrees to participate, but only to more loans.
The company Developperská "Angus et le Parallèle" that sought to give to the tune of seven million dollars from the ministry of culture on the repurchase cinematographic complex on the boulevard of Saint- Laurent and has shown mission as a lover of the arts movie, did not get what he wanted.
The government accepts that will be included in the dossier, but on its own terms.
Rather than the present government would propose Quebeku loan, which, incidentally, was lower, some of the original expectation that could lay the groundwork for a viable solutions for favourable conditions and with the funds coming from the state.
The first action plan and the requirement to 12,8 million have already been rejected Quebekem last spring, but applications have already been revised to cut.
The council and a plan of action sent secretary St-Pierre, the president of the society for business development in culture (SODEC), François Macerola, which governs cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final report was given ten days ago.
But the counter proposal by the government have entered the company SODEC on Tuesday.
Et Le Parallèle Angus have time to 31. Decembers to respond.
However, it appears that the hypothesis of grant from the state must really be dismissed.
Let us remember that the association of the owners of cinemas and cinematographic centres in Quebeku was built against direct investment of state in order to support the repurchase eXcentrisu, usuzujíc that the culture minister should not finance the project on the property, though it has not done for a different movie theatres.
But several of the participants in the debate by contrast, has been called a major economic boost.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, entered the premises of cinemas in ten years after the film art that he financed the construction of the complex, which could be the reason for the change from the side of the council of state.
The lack of halls for independent films has been vocal in Montréalu, and eXcentris knew himself to get a steady clientele.
The company Angus et le Parallèle, with Christianem Yaccarini in the head, driving campaign for the rest of the money to the private sector, in the belief that it would earn 700 to 000 $ protlačení the acquisition.
Since spring of 2009, the only one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, continues to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal is a potential acquirers to open up again, all three halls of day of 27. February next year and to project the most beautiful film Xaviera Beauvois men and bohové.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and so is ignored, then he, with group thinks about the proposals to reduce that it činěny.
Zvednutá curtain in Canada as a whole...
New diplomatic American springs made known by WikiLeaks show that the United States is seen as an inferiority complex of Kanaďanů to the american people, but the same strike, arguing the feeling of superiority the latter to Canada.
A us diplomat was so mad that for every Canadian voter lies at the heart of the Canadian-American relations when it comes to choose, and believes that the visit of president Obama has helped tory government to take his budget for 2009!
four new reports which were the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington yesterday, arrant on display to the public, providing extra sensitive details with each other, they made "under the skin."
Communications with the date 22. of 2008, in the midst of an election campaign, detailed notes at what point the United States is not part of the bets about which dealt with political leaders.
The big surprise American ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkinse.
Mr Wilkins is providing this situation a few explanations.
"The Canadian of inferiority complex, nearly stiff, implicates possible political leaders to talk about internal bets instead to realise that this election is about and the us (as in the campaign to free trade in the year 1988," he writes.
"The United States is a" closed "proverbial elephant in this election. overall, but potentially too threatening than about them speak."
Ambassador understands that "ohlušujícímu silence" is less that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of the party's candidate, or better still, the boss of State to manage these important relationship should be a key factor that have the electorate in mind when they go to the polls."
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in the news sent 22 day January of 2009. Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa at Ottawa, preparing president Barack Obama, on his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the preservation of the government to vote of confidence at the start of the year, involving the Federal Budget by canada's publicly to admit its first deficit for more than a decade, because of the recovery plan of 30 to 40 billion dollars," wrote M. Breese.
Nowhere even mention that the government should be adjourned pre-Christmas session of parliament, so it can not be defeated by the coalition and the opposition party implicate the survival of the quality of the proposed a recovery plan.
Another report from january's of 2008 and signed by ambassador Wilkinsem, warns Washington to an increasingly negativnější the image that in the United States cast a dramatic serials posted on CBC.
Ambassador is worried by posting Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which can be seen not very adroit references to Maher Arar, "the Well-Fly- list" or on the kidnapping for the purposes of violent interrogations by the CIA.
Other news reports about what their first bilateral meeting Hillary Clinton has called French counterpart Bernard Kouchner whether Europe is prepared to accept some detainees from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner said yes, but based on the principle of " on a case-by-case basis."
At the end of the meeting, says this, "handed some paper for Omar Khadr, 15-year old Muslim Canadian resource, a national tajemnici."
"Secretary admitted that component will revisit."
Let us say the last time that the people of which relate to WikiLeaks, sweats.
This Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harperovi, said the waves CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be " destroyed."
It was noised and was heard about this, and Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A plan to restore the illuminations
The UN yesterday suggested in Cancúnu a plan to restore the domestic lighting, lighting business and industrial space in 100 countries to achieve the reduction of greenhouse effect (GES), which reflects nearly a third more restrictions that needs to be done to stabilise the climate of the planet from now on, to 2020.
The ambitious plan is in a phase large concrete projects which wants the UN to put in Cancúnu to the absence of hard to feasible of commitment to cutting in industrialised countries.
According to yesterday's proposed plan, if rozžhavené a light bulb, who monopolize even 50 to 70% markets, we will be replaced by light bulbs fluokompaktními or, even better, a light bulbs with elektroluminiscentními the diodes (DEL or " ICE" in English), a number from 1,8 billion tonnes (Gt) GES emissions on the planet created because of a lighting was destroyed.
Illuminations are responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of emissions from the vehicle fleet on the planet.
In Copenhagen last year the big countries with significant share of the emissions in the United States, China, Europe and other, among them Canada, involved in voluntary plans to cut that should enable the drop in global emissions GES from 53 to 49 Gt Gt.
But it will be deducted from the record 5 Gt has yet to be reached in of 2020 to stabilise the climate heating to 2 degrees Celsius in order to exclude that will not get out of control.
In rozžhavených the light bulb of 95% energy is scattered in the form of heat and the rest, 5%, is a product of light.
With fluokompaktními the light bulbs with energy consumption decreases by 75% and with a new light bulbs with DEL, we will reduce consumption and twice.
Fluokompaktní light bulbs will endure an average of 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new light bulbs with DEL, one that said this week to produce Philips - the company allegedly took part in the study of the UN - they have expected life of of 25 hours and 000, will spend 80% less energy than rozžhavená light bulb, which gives us an idea about a possible rescue plan with the compensation that has been applied in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also operate with reostaty and stream less heat.
And do not contain any mercury.
Some experts have expressed reservations about fluokompaktním the light bulbs, as it contains mercury and they need to be classified as hazardous waste, which still would not be possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers are established a set.
Of course, as the report says, the main source of mercury on the planet is not fluokompaktní a light bulb, but rather thermal coal power plants, which emit lots of mercury to be generating electricity promrhané in rozžhavených the light bulbs.
Only in the United States these headquarters in circulation of 25 000 tons of mercury annually.
The report also provides profits in detail, from the international agenda, each country.
For example, Indonesia, so spare a trillion dollars per year to purchase electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which would be equivalent of of 3,5 power plants whose structure would cost 2,5 trillion
The Ivory Coast eagerly await the results of the election results.
UN Secretary - General, Ban Ki-moon, has ordered a swift publication of the results of presidential elections in the Ivory Coast after just set deadlines.
"The secretary-general stressed the need for independent election commission had finished work and immediately announced preliminary results, highlighted spokesman for the president of the UN."
"Ask all sides in the Ivory Coast and institutions to prove a sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiatives to announce provisional results."
Despite the pressures made some foreign governments let electoral commission to be the ultimate date:Wednesday at midnight - without publish the results, three days after the Sunday scrutinium.
Over forty minutes before the deadline, CEI on tv, confirmed that the commission " to continue working" to be able to announce results.
On Wednesday, worldwide appeals multiplied to CEI was the last time the name of the winner of the second round, between president Laurent Gbagbo and a member of the opposition Alassanem Ouattara.
But Gbagbo camp is counting on the annulment of the constitutional council for " fraudulent" vote in the north, which manages the former rebels new army (FN) from the failed coup in the 2002 attack.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in the Ivory Coast, confirmed that the manoeuvres of the intimidation of voters who used (FN) new army in the north of the country, discouraged the supporters of the president of the Ivory Coast since then to lead to vote.
Elections could undo whether the constitutional council into account the complaints that gave Gbagbo.
Of course, an opponent of president Gbagbo believes that the Supreme court is not neutral because it follows Paul Yao N'Dré, very close political ally of president Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, the man from the north, which denies any links with former rebels, sentenced delay in the announcement of results as " unacceptable" and demanded Gbagba to be respected, but not go that far, it has been clamouring for victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo block publication of the results because it knows that have suffered damage, and to complain to the constitutional council after he defended the electoral commission to send the results would be unlawful.
A second round of presidential elections underway on Sunday, was seen as the coronation of the process of reunions and a reconciliation of the country that is already the years, split into two halves.
The united nations warned on Wednesday by political factions of the Ivory Coast that could be made responsible for the violence.
Laurent Gbagbo has ended in the first round, 31. October, as the winner with 38% votes compared to 32% for Alassana Ouattaru who won public support for former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains in the third quarter of france's stable.
The unemployment rate in France in the sense of the word, according to international employment office (BEAT) remained steadily to 9,3% in metropolitan France (9,7%, including overseas an area), as they point provisional data with the correction seasonal variations (CVS), which on Thursday issued INSEE.
The number of unemployed was fixed at 2,631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were 9,3% confirmed on active stocks in the metropolis and 9,7%, including overseas in the area.
For one year, the unemployment rate rising by 0,1 points.
In a broader crackdown, 3,4 million people in metropolitan France in third quarter do not work, but we would wish to work, regardless of whether they are or are not available for two weeks so that they can work, regardless of whether the work they are looking for or do not look for.
The plight of the young people in the employment market was still escalated with the new increase in the unemployment rate amounting to 24,2% in metropolitan France (+ 0,9 point for three months, +0,5 point for one year) and 25% overseas -- including the field.
In the third quarter was within the meaning of the word under international employment office without a job of 637 000 young people aged 15 to 24.
As for the elderly, those registered in metropolitan France a slight increase in unemployment to 6,4% in metropolitan France (+0,2 point for three months, as well as for the year), that is 482 of 000 people from 50 years higher and 6,6%, including overseas in the area.
Only the population in the age of 25-49 years had benefited from the stability of unemployment to 8,3% in metropolitan France (- 0,1 points in three months, +0,1 points per year) and 8,8% across France.
Insee no longer publish the monthly unemployment rate of of 2006, after a controversy over his method of calculating.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, by contrast, is continuing in drawing - up the monthly statistics and on Tuesday announced a 9,8% rate for France (including DOM) during October, after a September was 9,9%.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and put on the link
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the leaders of the plant to process of waste and the brother of PS board of directors Bouches-du-Rhône, was charged and imprisoned in prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation in the matter of public works, supposedly surreptitiously obtained.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of misuse of the assets of the company, misuse of public funds and public property, concealment, delivering bribes, receiving bribes to interferences of power and possession of ammunition, his attorney says.

One of his close, Philippe Rapezzi, was at the centre of the evening also charged and imprisoned.
According to his lawyer, simon Lucien, his client has not done anything anywhere other than that the behaviour of landfill sites that could be managed.
As for the allocation of regulations or the destination of the funds linked to their operation, never on anything that he did not know, says mr simon.
In this matter was Daniel Pinna, the former Chief Executive of accumulation Aubagne, blamed on Wednesday for misuse of public funds and design, and leave at large, under judicial supervision with the ban to annex, a supporter of the whole thing.

Finally, a commercial partner Alexander Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "concealment of abuse of the assets of the company."
Among people who were confronted with Mr Guérinim, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard feature, which was recently charged in a parallel case of fraudulent contracts, on Corsica.
Investigators suspect the companies that helped to wash money from a broad gangsterství.
Investigations are conducted within a few open a judicial inquiry into an X in a 2009 after accepting anonymous letters concerning the alleged fraud during closing of public works, especially on the issue of waste.

Event: Clotilde Reiss The élysée palace exaggerated syria's mediation
During more than ten months to July, from 2009 to 2010, in a deal Klotildy Reissové, young zatčené research worker in Iran as " spying," unite views in France, said diplomacy to battle readiness and stressed relations between Paris and Tehran.
All that closely followed by diplomats from the United States.
The American documents, received via WikiLeaks and konzultované with Le Monde show some disadvantages of this crisis.
They described how the élysée palace to explain to Americans, while going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such cases of hostages in Iran ,a small group of tourists).
They show how the manager of French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of the younger Frenchwomen was not a substitute against job cuts at large, Majida Kakavanda Iranians vězněného in France and the us want justice for surreptitious the trade in materials in favour of iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they subjected to harsh light of the way in which the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to entrusted idea that syria's president Al-Assad prison officer, played a central role in the liberation Klotildy Reissové.
In fact, he has done nothing.
Diplomatic telegram composed of day 12. August 2009 in Paris has the headline: "Iran: the French commentary in the way of solutions in the case of hostages."
Advisers from the élysée palace for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by Quai d'Orsay director for northern Afrikua Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with representatives of American diplomacy Allegrone.
Explaining her French procedure.
Encourage Americans to do it as much for it to be shipped back to the country of their own nationals violently detained in Iran.
" Make noise," they say, "constantly forcefully voiced" in the media of the word " the fundamental rights of man," " innocence," " immediate delivery."
We need to bring in to trouble the Iranian regime, sensitive to the image.
"Do it, the more, the more you will demand that it stop."
Since there have been attempts to negotiate through discreet channels, " the silence of nothing will address" the Iranians are the champions " in evasive manoeuvres."
Mr Richier notes that arrests of foreigners is "an Iranian family policy. taking of hostages for political purposes " blackmail."
Reports that the liberation Klotildy Reissové (which occurs day of 16. August, on the day that it is providing refuge to the French embassy) "would require pay large sums Iranians" (bail of 230 000).
And he will announce that the élysée palace anticipate the cases of the hostages, who wonder, "will intensify."
Iranians "in the future could arrest the roughly 1800 French living in Iran" he says.
28. August of 2009.
Klotilda Reissová left prison for 12 days ago, but still remains blocked in Iran.
Information is spreading. The Iranian Majid Kakavand, the United States says about who he was vyhoštěn for the illegal trade in sensitive electronic material in respect to Iran, is in Paris, set free by the decision of a judge.
The American embassy, as many observers asked on his troublesome agreement.
For Washington, which will follow the illegal Iranian networks to the acquisition of the material for a nuclear programme, Majida expanse Khakavanda bad news.
France agreed on smlouvání?
Liberation of Iranians for the liberation of the younger Frenchwomen?
In another interview from Kathleen Allegrone, 4, of September, François Richier affirms that this is not the case.
The élysée palace, as it says, was not only "jump the decision of a judge," but were looking for a chance, as opposed to build.
"There have been conversations between the presidency and the ministry of justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government can not change the court's decision," observes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under a " limited" oversight of the French intelligence services.
The élysée palace advisers call a phone number, telephone receiver hitches and then informs the American briefcase that iran is currently in Paris buildings are administered by the Iranian embassy."
At the time of the arrests Klotildy Reissové in Iran develop the élysée palace the effort, is negotiating through the communiqué and organised "leaks" to the media to convince that Bachar syria's president Al-Assad has a " significant" and "influential" role " mediátora."
Americans see this activity is not without irony, and note that manipulation bear fruit, as several articles in the press reflects a French official version.
Telegram from day of 25. August 2009 recalls, " blest" a French official agents."
What is built such a degree of " gratitude" to vyjadřovaná M. Assadovi, ask embassy in Paris.
"Despite their statements full chvalořečí French official agents in private they acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what Syřané actually done."
The document then are studying the reasons that push the élysée palace to pay for this fiction.
Intensive outreach "heading for validaci the policies of president Sarkozy opening up to Syria," analysing.
Policies applied during 2008, "has seen many critical voices in France and abroad and classified as premature and unearned."
By that, "as exaggerates the Syrian role," "Paris is trying to demonstrate Syria, which chvalořeči can serve when he played a constructive role in the region."
The goal is also to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The American embassy knows this from a very good source.
11. August, François Richier, he made reference: "of course, we do not know whether Syřané do something, whether it is nothing"
"But we have to thank."
"It should at least bring confusion and ambiguity between iran's."
Klotilda Reissová returning to France 16. was 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy takes him at the élysée palace.
The communiqué thank the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their " active part in favour of the liberation of our countrywoman."
The end of online games after midnight for young Korean
The South Korean government will adopt a law called " Peciválský" that will prohibit adolescents to play online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, they gave a responsible government officials.
A bill will be submitted to parliament for December, to ask the companies provozující online game for the blocking of access to these games after midnight people under the age of of 16, said representatives from the ministry of culture and department for the family.
"Many children playing these games all night long and then have problems with learning at school and are not able to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is needed to ensure that can be assured their health and their right to sleep," AFP reported for jo Rin, a senior official at the ministry who has a bill in charge.
Online game will be newly accessible from 6 o'clock in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of law, set.
The government also assumes that will require companies to limit the daily times of access to these games for young, whose parents to this request, added supervisor.
It will also make available to people who ask for it, the programs for free, to reduce time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most severely affected " and" daily newspapers regularly produces a variety of fact, coupled with intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world competition in online games.
In the autumn of South Korea won four gold medals at World Cyber Games, even in the face of 58 other nations.
The World Series in years: 2018-2022 Fifa regulates the host country.
Full of upheaval because of suspicions of corruption regulates Fifa executive committee on Thursday the host countries in the World Cup of of 2018 and 2022, the choice svrchovaně politically motivated, where fighting the influence and lobbying they risk that they will overtake the technical criteria.
Thing is certain, royal Fifa competition in the year 2018se will be held in Europe, the traditional fort of this discipline (4 candidates. England, russia, Spanish- Nizozemí- Portugal, Belgium).
Championships in a 2022 will be far more exotic, and the international federation hopes that he will be able to win new territory (Qatar, Australia) for premiéře on the African continent as 2010, or continue to pursue the insertion of the United States or to the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personality, who will attend as part of a delegation (David Cameron, prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, prince of qatar, senior government officials in Belgium and the netherlands, Zidane and Beckham, Cruyff) offers the chance to form an idea of the scale of economic/political bets of the world.
Negotiations on behind the scenes face a risk that they will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish hierarchy, according to the candidates.
According to the scoreboard Fifa documentation English, Spanish-Portuguese (of 2018) and American (2022) contain the best argument, as well as documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons, it will not have too much weight on 22 executive commission into the hour for a vote.
The Sunday Times at the beginning of detected, leading to a suspendování two members of /Evropsk and CE commission? standard for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adam), so destroying the chances of the country, the birthplace of football, which has hosted the world championships only once a year.
The BBC has sat on Monday crown when he sent a document that "bet on the pin" three influential members of CE (the European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa disgruntled and bringing in English to bother senior official with David Cameron in the first place.
The prime minister hopes that he will be able to reproduce the tensions that made its predecessor in office, Tony Blair, who is 2005, managed to win for the London organising the Olympic Games of 2012.
Going to get this intense activity to new England added shine title at CE (the European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain because the couple Spanish- Portugal does not lack the trumps already prepared for stadiums, its expert report (the world championship of 1982 in Spain, 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the grim economic and financial prospects of the two countries could put these ambitions cold shower.
A possible retaliation against Angličanům and doubts about pay the quality of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was the outsider, despite the gaps in his dossier (stadiums, hotels and transport).
But prime minister Vladimir Poutin decided that the championship will not move to Curichu and publicly proclaimed " unfair competition in the run-up to the vote" in the word allusions just barely tie to the English press charges for CE (European Commission).
"After we get through mud, we will seek them zkompromitovat," said Mr Poutin.
For 2022, seems to be a logical favoritem the United States with considerable experience of 1994.
The highest performance of the economy in the world, the headquarters of the main sponsors Fifa, it seems that this country has a big priority over Japan and south Korea, which separately, indented beautiful project.
But those candidacy seems to be premature for the two countries, which together during 2002, lost a " test."
Another threat: the World number of 2026, which makes horoucně wants Fifa, made Asian chances for 2022 invalid.
In qatar, which would pull out of the sleeve big ace in the shape of a futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa continue its expansion into new landscape, but these two countries account for more risks than safety.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, would reckon charges for poor TV (because of the temporary shift) paid European countries, forming a force for Fifa.
A second mandate. evidence (security)
De Gaulle really hesitant.
Mitterrand, gave the appearance that he is hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that.
The élysée palace calling someone else.
The current Head of State will therefore be a candidate for 2012.
But the evidence is not a good agreement with a share of the secret to do with holders of the post.
So it is worth doing, as though doubts remain constant.
In one, in another sense.
During 2006, without wanting to believe, friends Jacques Chirac did the best demands for a third mandate has not been ruled out.
15. in the November with a serious expression Nicolas Sarkozy assured them that "will decide sometime in the autumn of 2011."
He remembers from members of Parliament on Wednesday THE evening at the élysée palace, the term " two mandates" zasela little frantic situation.
It was an official announcement of his candidacy?
It was not that far away.
He merely reminded that measures the constitution of 2008 has reduced the number of five-year term for two.
It was by him of having only, not notice.
It is not the first time that recalls such meetings, humorous tone presidential election.
"In the worst case, or at best, is still seven and a half years with me," swapped in 2009.
The rebellions in the of 2010 "Do not think that I do not reflect on another stage."
His day-before-yesterday said it will not make the list more than the previous day. it will not make him a candidate or less.
If they cast commentary, it is because of duplicate the truth.
Speeding - up the way for the candidacy to PS, on page one.
But that is not entering kolbiště Ségolèna of the royal it is pressing, nicolas Sarkozy, to be convictd.
It is the opposite for his candidacy in the 2012 is clear that many in PS they want to hold configurations to battle rather premature than intended.
Bad research on the other.
First, the voters of the right would have preferred the candidacy of françois Fillona before the candidacy of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have candidate and we are not discussing this matter with the UMP," responded immediately and obezřele people from the nearest vicinity of prime minister.
"If they can defeat, will not run," informs Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"It still will believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, balanced with the evidence.
The Euro. The European central bank forced to continue buying national titles.
The latest council of governors, there should be an opportunity for the specification of conditions for discomposure from the crisis or, at least, the announcement of a suspension large number of unusual operations monetary policy, which must be ended by the end of this year.
The European sovereign debt tied to the institute for issuing securities, will no doubt not be able to afford to be so many categorical with the threat of a deterioration of the situation today already tense on European markets for securities.
The political price in that case was about higher.
Yesterday at the press conference, the French finance minister Christine Lagarde to pay tribute to the lead, who plays the European central bank for dealing with the crisis of the debt European states.
He did not want to say whether they believe the bank could do more for example, would increase the programme of buying sovereign obligations.
"I reserve account for my European partners (...) ."
The evening before in Brussels during questioning by the commission for economic and monetary affairs of the European Parliament, president Centrální European bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not proved výřečnější about his intentions, and was satisfied that indicated that the programme of buying a national titles on the secondary market " ongoing" and that "we will see how we decide" during the meeting is being held this Thursday.
The only certainty. The European central bank will watch a non-negotiable interest rate to 1%, its historically low levels from the of 2009.
In fact, purchases a commitment from the cash register taken the European central bank, last week doubled to almost 1,35 billion euros.
And thanks to rehabilitate dohodců on the market made yesterday's new purchases, Irish and Portuguese obligations.
Overall, central banks have bought the eurosystem to 67 billion from the of 2010.
Among dohodci on the market in anticipation of continuing purchases not allow any misgivings (see page of 29).
Even economists do not expect any major change of course.
If the operations of lending to more than three months ago has disappeared from the arsenal central to European banks, approaching the last bank to provide unlimited liquidity funding under the generous terms and at the time of the duration from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this mechanism will be extended for several months.
"I can not imagine that i would change significantly."
"If not, this would be to take the risk of short-term processing new strain," says Michael Schubert, Commerzbank economist.
"The starting point announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more probable" anticipates Bräms Norbert, economist at the shala cities.
Oppenheim.
The us treasury's intervention in the market for sovereign debt, "should the European Central Bank to keep the volume of buying a pledge to restore a weak market," joins Norbert Bräms.
Given the exposure of European banks to the markets with sovereign debt in the eurozone has no further on the choice of nothing more than to maintain a presence in the market.
"They need at any cost to replace the lack of investors into the market and to act in such a way to prevent the flare-up buying power states belonging among the most fragile," revealed yesterday, manager of serious commitment.
Because if interest rates flew up, it will be with the state even more to, in order to cut its debt, instead of her match.
It is saving for that price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government's stoops behind
After the start of the week worrying for Italy, the situation a bit, released yesterday, with the flow of bond increased to 10 years.
Returning to the temporary calm.
The chairmen of regions said they heard Giulia Tremontiho how the situation qualifies as " no soluble" and that he expects " nepředvídatelný" weekend that included then denied at the end of a meeting with the minister for the economy.
Anyway, on Tuesday deviation from the German increases reached a record of 210 basis points and price contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) flew up to 263 points in Rome has caused some agitation.
A note in the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi that variations in Spain with the German was an increase of more than of 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, has announced that it is "too busy " troubled" developing markets" and the possible infection of resources from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the Euro zone, are not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at Hudson to the constitution.
Clearly, nešifrovaně, its problem is the lack of growth and lacklustre fiscal input that goes hand-in-hand and exposes this country risk that they will not be able to cover its financing needs.
The latest projections Brussels were for government cold shower.
Italian growth is from now on future to 1,1% during 2011 and 1,4% in the year 2012... while the budget, which is available for the Senate to his analysis, at 1,3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, calculated by the European Commission, will be a shortfall of public money to imagine even 4,3% of gross domestic product next year (by 3,9%) projected government, and 3,5% to 2012 (instead of 2,7%).
Hence the reputation of the new summary doplňků to a draft of a government budget that could be imposed after the holidays, amounting to 7 billion euros.
"If it is necessary, will have to be adopted a new tough action," evaluates commissioner for economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment of Italy accepts the support of international institutions.
"The fundamental building blocks of its economy is in order and its calculations are correct, we repeat this for a long time," affirms Arrigo Sadun, Italian board member of the IMF under pressure from Italy to the IMF.
"It is not any immediate problem, not even a short-term or long-term, because despite significant debt (of 119,2% of the gross domestic product of 2011 NDLR), is working to stabilise the required in Italy smaller than the effort required of other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OCDE chief economist.
Remaining question of political instability.
14. Decembers Silvio Berlusconi will face censure motion in the Lower House of Parliament, and then after that i could begin to organize elections, with whom will be counted at the end of the March.
I would start this season, poorly suited to a decision is taken in case of serious crisis.
Europeans think about strengthening anti-crisis mechanism.
Christine Lagarde has again highlighted yesterday in a press conference in Paris. "I think the europeans have demonstrated on Sunday throughout the day and night, are obviously very solitary, angažovaní determined to defend their monetary and currency zone."
Although it is all relative, yesterday zaznamenaná expansion, related to increases in European national commitment, bringing water to the mill governments and the European central bank.
But we can not even talk about the start of normalisation.
The notation standard & Poor's announced that could lower the record about the debt of Portugal, goals that most focused various rumours.
"Because there is a real May not sufficiently transparent and clear policies, based mainly on the banking systems," say economists Exane BNP Paribas.
More on what the "political time is running more slowly than the market."
Aware of that suspended and the dangers that is hiding, zintenzivňují European countries, aimed at strengthening existing crisis mechanism.
Informal consultations among Finance Ministers, the most affected by the problem, and on a broader scale, with their counterparts from the G20, is developing very well.
And so with respect to a meeting of the eurogroup (Eurogroupe) and the Ecofin, from the beginning of next week.
The European central bank is taking place today.
On the agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to support the Euro zone countries with a focus on markets (see above).
As for European fund of funds (FESF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, zapořčal on Tuesday in Singapore following the path Asia, to inform investors from the Far east on the development of the crisis in Europe.
If it is not the aim of the trip to raise funds, is being prepared by surely land to achieve this goal.
The first problem of securities FESF are expected next month.
Yesterday a us official representative of the agency told Reuters that the United States will support the expected increase mobilizovaných funding further direct involvement in FMI.
The country is primarily about Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in terms of trade organisation of work.
The reforms, which are joined by strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid differently than they used to Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want at all costs to avoid what would you ask for international assistance even before it applied its own budget correctives and more focused on structural reforms required to once again they have gained lasting confidence.
Capital participants in eu funds are finally about the options, available for speeding - up the process of normalisation of the market in sovereign obligations.
At the way to Paris. the autumn of 24, the axel Weber came up with the idea whether i would not reach 750 billion mobilizovaných Europe and the international monetary fund, the union did not hesitate again to get on the supply of securities.
Economists from Barclays Capital, which is the player entirely of the first order of business with European sovereign debt, thinks that cca addition of of 100 billion euros would achieve, " rather" a form of direct provision of liquidity.
The money is there: it is a European mechanism financial stability fund to this day of 60 billion.
The council, which has every chance to try in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions worsened.
Snow and glaze. 24 orange counties are on call.
Sněhové doses cause further difficulties for transport, especially on the roads of other classes in Brittany, and there is a risk that will undermine any economic activity.
Twenty-four districts have from now on, the orange emergency because of the threat of snow and glaze.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, the forest and la Deux-Sèvres Vienne, joined 20 districts, which already have called the orange on call, 18, from Wednesday afternoons and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France considerable inrushes of snow is causing problems in the north la Gironde and the wood Charentes and weakly snows on the Ile-de-France.
Sněhová covering 2 to 5 cm, at times from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected districts and covering 1 to 3 cm, places and 5 in Paris region.
Districts are affected, Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, the Dordogne, du Poitou and districts as an area of Basse- Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The inrushes of snow are big enough to ensure that caused difficulties in transport and disrupted some economic activity, predicts Météo France.
The Côtes d'Armor coast, some districts has banned passage difficult to transport goods - the truck over 7,5 tonnes of the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic on the roads of other classes in Brittany, according to the police, very difficult and police advised to go out with a vehicle only when this is really necessary and operation of some of the truck was on that day.
In Pikardii school relations were on Thursday banned.
On Wednesday the evening are not expected any specific measures to reduce freight.
District office "calls on all of the drivers of cars to the maximum caution on the roads and to adapt to ride the nature of the carriageway."
The directorate general of civil aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% Thursday flights at Paris airport Roissy and 10% at Orly, because of the expected inrushes of snow.
DGAC advise passengers that use of air transport services, to join with the company.
In Britain, until Thursday with a wound zavřená of Gatwick airport's south London and an airport in Edinburgu in Scotland.
The metro grande Paris. the initial financial guidance
Since the debate about upgrading traffic at Ile-de-France in full swing, rain billion.
At least during the debate.
We remember extra 23 billion on the metro, the grande Paris, which is intended to put the company Société du the grande Paris.
To this structure could be launched, said the state providing subsidies to the tune of of 4 billion.
The abstract it is an amount that will allow companies to use the SGP on orders part of its financing from its dual source.
Now we finally get to the first additions.
Rektifikační law on the finances of of 2010, which investigates financial committee of the National Assembly this morning, involves mechanisms determined to provide these resources.
There were two: creating a special tax on equipment and increase taxes on the offices of Ile-de-France.
First, we can read the text of a bill, section of 15, is "in favour of a public institution Société du grande Paris."
It is vyčíslena. "The use of this increase is 117 million annually."
The second is the rebuilding of rate for the office that already exists "to be modernised in order to increase revenue from acquired him and that these increases the company Société du grande Paris."
How much of this was born?
Hallucination.
That is not vyčísleno in the text.
We have far to 4 billion.
"It is upřesněno that the fiscal resources are joined by 4 billion of equity grants, which will be mobilised by the state and put into the company Société du grande Paris, according to the project," we can read in explaining why.
Us in the company's SGP the system does not seem shocking.
"From the moment when we created (both income tax, ndlr), we can cover studies for a period of three years and then rake to 4 billion, he chose it."
"That will be included in the budget and used as necessary."
SGP company believes that 4 billion will be put up 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism in which 4 billion slíbené see even absent subscribers, risks that will cause a little busy parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be 7 Decembers.
Revengeful hacker and diligent a spy
If WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On one side are revealed flagrant affair, a scandal that seems to be the scandal only in the face of hypocrisy governing the relationship between states, the people and the press.
On the other hand, testifies to the profound changes at international level, and anticipates a future ovládanou of regression.
But let us move popořádku.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, this is a testimony to the fact that every document drawn up by the security services (of any nation) consists only of the press cuts.
" The extraordinary discovery" of Americans on the way Berlusconi's sex life, they report that has for months everyone can read it in every newspaper (all except the two Berlusconi owns), and unluckily karikaturní profile Kadáfího was a long time in cabaret artist by the council for outlines.
The rule under which the secret documents are allowed to hold only from the reports are already known, is crucial to the dynamics of the security services, not just in this century.
If you go to the bookstore, which is devoted ezoterické literature, you will see that each match repeats (about Graalu, mystery Rennes-le-Château, templars or Masonry) exactly what has been written in the previous job.
And not just because the author of the texts like occult is investigating after new information (nor does not know where to look for news about nonexistent), but because those who are devoted to occultism believes only what they know and what it shows that even before they learnt.
That is the mechanism for success Dan Brown.
Same goes for secret documents.
Informant is lazy, lazy or limited (spirit) the head of the secret service (and if, couldnot was, as I know, the editor of the newspaper Libération) by the actual only that it will confess.
Information with high secrecy about Berlusconi that the American embassy sent state department, were the same that Newsweek published the week before.
Why, then, about the discovery of these documents produced so much fuss?
On the one hand, they say that every cultured man already knew, namely that embassy, at least since the end of World War II and since the Heads of State called or to fly from aircraft on a joint dinner, they have lost diplomatic functions and, except for a few small practices in the presence transformovaly into espionage facilities.
No spectator sledující films on the investigation very well aware that just this seemingly ignoring from licoměrnosti themselves.
However, the fact that it repeats publicly, defames the duty of hypocrisy and cast a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can gain nejpřísněji information utajované most powerful country in the world is a tough blow, not a not insignificant, for the prestige of the state department.
The scandal impact both victims and her "performer."
But let us get from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once, at times, Orwell's be able to deal with all as a kind of Big Brother, which checked every movement of people.
Orvellovo prophecy has shown since thanks to the ability to control every movement through the phone, every transaction, has visited the hotel, used highway and so on, it became a citizen total victim of a wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate how this goes far that even " vaults" with information nejtajnějšími powerful can not resist the intervention of some hacker, ceases to be monitoring report one-way and becoming a flyer.
There is a lot of cheques every citizen, but every citizen, or at least hacker - chosen as the avenger of citizen - may know the secret of power.
How can maintain their power, which no longer be allowed to keep their secret?
It is true that already Georg Simmel said that the real secret is comprehensiveless secret (and comprehensiveless secrets will not be able to never be identified); it is also true that all information about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel is actually a mysterious comprehensiveless secret because it is vytaženo from public life; but to prove just as it did WikiLeaks that the secret Hillary Clinton was comprehensiveless secrets, meant to distract him all the power.
WikiLeaks has not done any fault with Sarkozy and Merkel, but made by something large Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of such a blow uštědřené of power so important?
It is clear that in future states will not be able to send online sensitive information - that was stabilised its publication on a bill vylepeném on the corner of streets.
But it is also very clear that it is unnecessary to hope with current technologies that can be kept in a secret report by telephone.
Nothing is easier than to see whether and when the heads of State arrived by plane and has been linked to some of my colleagues.
Both will be allowed to continue to be maintained in secret private and sensitive news?
I am well aware that for the moment my prediction is among science-fiction and so it is fantastic, but I must represent a government official who are carrying diskrétně delivery of formalities in the wake of rampant routes and carries on, only those reports that they know zpaměti or rather they conceal a rare information in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in a unique copies in the drawers concluded the key: all in all, the attempted espionage in the Watergate scandal has had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology now move aside ahead, this means pozpátku.
A century later, when wireless wire was a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated wire based on the wires (phone).
Videocassettes (analog) has allowed the cinema lovers of film to go step - by - step, move it forwards and backwards and to show all the secret of assembly, whereas now CD (digital) allows only to jump after the chapters, this mean for makroporcích.
Through express trains dojedeme from Rome to Milan for three hours, while on the trip by plane and transportation, which includes we need three and a half hours.
So it is extraordinary that the policy and communication techniques will return to the cars taženým the horses.
A final word.
At other times, the press tried to understand what had been a in secret of embassies.
Now it is embassy requiring confidentiality of the press.
Climate: both France hackla promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen accord is time to seek compliance with promises of quick odblokovaná financing (řečená of funding with a fast start (fast start) or premature), implemented developed countries.
And the great French hacky were discovered
In the Copenhagen agreement has developed countries pledged to provide 30 billion dollars between 2010-2012.
The European Union has pledged 7,2 billion over three years and France 1,26 billion euros (that is 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16 of the EU, big ace to convince shareholders about the feasibility of commitment for financing fast start. the report upřesňující action member states, the press conference, grande party events, distribute booklets...
Transparent operation nedocenitelná and oceněná on the real value: developed countries and civil society would like to see them all developed countries and civil society was equally and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU report that the 2010 release 2,2 billion that it brings on track to keeping its pledge of of 7,2 billion in the year 2012.
But if we look at the detail, we see that things are more complicated than that.
These funds are under the Copenhagen agreement " new and additional" to ensure that the increased burden carried out without harm to the public to help to develop.
Unfortunately, there is not agreement that means " new and additional."
While the European Commission proposed alignment, some member states, among other things, France, process blocked.
Today, everyone will choose a reference that suits him best.
The European Commission, for example, saw it as a reference year of of 2009. international funding was preserved and she to him, it adds 150 million for three years for the title of " fast start.
Other countries choose a similar references with an annual salary schedules or with the terms of the level of public aid for development.
By contrast, believes that funding for " all new projects" of of 2010 are " new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to spending the previous season or global levels of public aid in the development of d'Aide publique au développement.
Specifically, the total amount of support from France to the developing countries can remain non-negotiable (or even be diminished), have to comply with a commitment to consider financing a " new and additional..."
Another crucial element is a division of the gifts and loans.
Yet there is no rule and each will choose its own way of computing.
Some, like for example. France, thinks that 1€ půjčené equals 1€ darovanému.
Apparently, it is hard to verifiable. quest is not přirovnatelná.
If using loans can be justified for some investment that is productive (often it is the projects associated with the reduction of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to give one Euro, which we will get, as equal one Euro, which we give... we would not have to draw from the title of commitments, but as the cost of borrowing for the creditor countries (i.e equal interest in peace).
But France can give just such reasoning: " respected" the commitment of eur of 420 million, from that produces 91,5% loans (of 389,8 million) and 8,5% notes (of 36,1 million Euro) - see the document from the EU that it could verify.
Are the only countries of the union, which uses such measure of borrowing.
Germany has ordered 46% from here, while Denmark, the netherlands and Slovakia (among others) holds its 100% gifts.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union gives 1€ on the promise of satisfaction, will give France only 10 centimů and sees this quest for a comparable.
Beautiful kejklířský piece!
For a summary, the funding a "fast start" France operates with a double šejdířstvím. on one side of the evolution of stock at a time and, on the other hand, with real financial burden.
Although spends just 36,1 million euros, can believe that spend 420 million euros " new and additional" in relation to its promises.
The manipulation of the exchequer (as seems to be that Bercy, who did such decisions) could have a double negative impact, while inside the EU (why member states continue donating when you only have to borrow?) and in negotiations, as developing countries are not entirely naive...
The chapter early funding is only a small otázečkou, relatively short-term, given the number of discussions on climate.
But it could be a granule of sand in addition to the massive machine like the UNFCCC.
Hopefully, this will not be the case.
This is nothing, is needed to inject findings from this first year of early funding.
First i took France to announce changes to the way the management accounting records for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect, commitment and decency and fairness to other eu countries.
But above all, France should avoid debates on deposits of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently being debated). we will not escape the question " dodatečnosti" or on the way zaúčtování of loans.
France should change its position that has become so pokrokářská at these deposits, as it is at rest.
Hope, then they all point to the new minister for the environment, Ms Kosciusko-Morizetové who arrive in Cancunu next week.
Surprising announcement that fast the launch of France and its vision of a " dodatečnosti" and the use of loans could cause an increase in the level of international confidence necessary for this to be possible to go further in discussions.
