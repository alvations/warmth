The exchange of Prague ended with fewer points at the end of the day 
After the rapid decline of the morning, the stock exchange of Prague corrected its losses. 
Transactions of the actions of ČEZ reached approximately half of value in a normal day. 
The stock exchange of Prague, at the start of trading Tuesday, reacted immediately to the fall of the Monday when it fell about 6%. 
The decline of this time was due to the collapse of stocks on Wall Street. 
Here also expresses the reaction from the market to the outcome of the vote of the US House of Representatives who refused to endorse the plan of stabilisation of the secretary of the financial sector. 
Fall of stocks in Asia 
The actions of the Asian exchanges Tuesday experienced a dramatic decline, but throughout the day, the index atenuó finally part of the losses. 
The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong exchange along its financial day marked an almost four percent, although later atenuó their losses by reducing the decline in almost a 2.5 percent. 
The Hang Seng index China enterprises that continues to movements of the Chinese actions in the Hong Kong stock exchange fell 3.8 per cent, in Shanghai markets were closed. 
The actions of the stock exchange of Sydney lost more than five percent but, in the end, the losses fell to a 4.3%. 
The stock exchange of Taiwan, according to the secretary of the index fell to a 3.6 percent. 
"The actions planned rescue in the USA are unsafe and this influences the financial markets around the world," said the head of the office of the currency of Hong Kong, Joseph Yam. 
Although Hong Kong is part of China, she determines its word about monetary policy, i.e., without dependency on the Central Bank of China. 
Interest rates of Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States. 
American lawmakers should return to meet as soon as possible, according to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and approve a proposal supporting the financial system. 
Otherwise, threat that the declines will be felt in other countries. 
Bloody bathroom American actions 
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to help the financial system to which it should spend 700 billion dollars (almost a 12 billion kroner). 
Lawmakers, in this way, ignored the invitation of President George Bush to support his plan. 
For Bush, the plan would solve the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilise the whole economy. 
On Monday, the American actions lived a bloody bathroom and mainly the index of stocks picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years. 
The Dow Jones index fell nearly seven per cent, a fall of volume similar recorded for the last time in 1987. 
The index fell because before being announced but as soon showed that the proposal of the house was not ahead, the index began to fall freely. 
Congress cut: the government of the USA can inject 700 billion dollars into the banking 
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreement was reached in a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the system of American finance. 
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week. 
American lawmakers prompted a gap in talks on the passage of the rescue plan in the form of aid to the American financial system, with the amount of 700 billion dollars (approximately SEK 12 trillion). 
However, it is still not won. 
The congressmen must hammer out details of the contract before they can make public the final shape of the law and that it is adopted. 
The plan to help the financial system will be discussed on Monday in the House of Representatives. 
The agency said Sunday Reuters, Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee on Financial Services and banking of the Assembly. 
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be carried out in the Senate not before Wednesday. 
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a prime factor psychologically significant for the revival of the financial market. 
Later, however, will come to the "desencantamiento" thanks to the complex mechanisms whose aid to reach the market in practice. 
Paulson: the plan must be effective 
"We have made a great progress. 
We solve our dissenting views with regard to the way that must have the package of measures to stabilise the market, "commented the Democrat Nancy Pelosiá the agency Bloomberg. 
According to her, the final vote could still be conducted Sunday. 
Representatives of lawmakers gathered Sunday night with the finance minister, Henry Paulson, to give a final form at the bottom of the government. 
This should buy of financial companies mortgage assets that are not sold to financial firms to tough losses and threaten the stability of the entire system. 
"We are on the verge of shutting down the convention on the plan, which will work and also to be effective in the market. 
It is still necessary to continue with the plan of sanitation, but I believe that we are already in it, "said Paulson. 
A signal to the Asian business 
The global financial crisis has expressly in the market for actions that fall quickly. 
According to the Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, legislators are doing everything possible to ensure that Congress approved an agreement this Sunday. 
Want to reassure business investors before the market for Asian finance because these are those who are in the first huso timetable and where Congress could influence in trade on Monday. 
For now, however, there is nothing clear with security vote on when the two chambers of Congress, and even, if not stagnate at the last moment with some problem. 
Lawmakers believe that it will be approved in the next few days. 
The law, however, suffer from a series of changes. 
The total amount intended to help the system should be divided into two parts. 
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush. 
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining quantity if I had the impression that the programme does not fulfil its function, which is another $100 billion and, later, the last 350 billion dollars. 
Bush put the progress of meetings 
Moreover, the president can veto this decision but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes. 
Despite these changes are retained the basic idea of the programme that was to win financial resources for the buyout of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish paying their mortgages. 
"We have worked all. 
The House of Representatives would be prepared to vote the law Sunday, and the Senate on Monday, "commented the Republican senator, Judd Gregg. 
The American President Bush is satisfied with the progress of the meetings. 
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the progress of the Saturday and to assess "the commitment of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy." 
Limiting the contract bullet-proof 
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiators, said that lawmakers decided on the responsibility of the money in the programme for the protection of the tax payers of their losses, a aliviadora closure of finance plan scheduled. 
The new law must also limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of societies participants in the programme, and creates a committee that will take control of the fund. 
This would lead to the Ministry of Finance. 
"We have worked very hard on this, and have made a breakthrough in the direction of the convention that will work and that it will be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson. 
The plan also has to help homeowners who have problems with their payments. 
The government would have to agree with the new payments which buys mortgages to lower the monthly charges of payments to deadlines for borrowers and enable them to stay in their homes. 
Marek: psychological help 
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of home finance, David Marek, a good idea that take place but quite difficult. 
"And this is why we do not know with what mechanism and at what price it will buy distressed assets. 
This will be critical to the distribution of losses across the financial sector and the government, "said Marek this week, for the server. IHNed Cz. 
Now that the plan be approved or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant. 
"Much more important is that, since this week the congressmen will agree on their support and give your imprimatur everything before they can. 
This important and psychological agreement is reached this approval is, at this moment, what is most important, "insisted Marek. 
Armed struggle to hand: the MP3 players against reproductive mobile. 
Advise him as choose 
While almost all mobile reproduces MP3 files, reproductive any MP3 players can make calls. 
What seems clear is that it is better to buy only the phone. 
Yet there are plenty of reasons for the man only acquires bear children. 
The choice is virtually the way of their use and the demand for the future owner. 
That will probably be difficult tocadiscos acquiring more modern to listen to him the last album of Turbulenc Maxim. 
Furthermore, this kind of products such as music discs LP of no longer go, and with regard to its quality there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them. 
If amassed on their shelves chloride discs with music art of rock, jazz or blues, is probably dreaming, at least, this kind of tocadiscos. 
This is the same with music that is of course, i.e., the comprimida, simplified music - music in the MP3. 
And here there are categories of price and quality. 
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand kroner in reproductive a, the same as for a lover of Pink Floyd that will hardly helmets of bazaar of twenty kroner. 
Two extremes, among whom there is enough space for each. 
The choice is wide. 
Also decides the duration of the battery 
One of the best players get much more than just reproduce music and even what even the majority of mobile phones. 
No current apparatus is as universal as the phone. 
Against the most basic functions like call, send messages, can reproduce music and video recording the two, has a better or worse apparatus to photograph and can achieve surf. 
And when we take into account the smartphone and PDA going to have in your pocket is also a small computer. 
This is a small miracle that no longer fridge knows make a parrillada and no television can photograph. 
The universality of the mobile brings us also disadvantages. 
Few more functions used in mobile will fall before the indicator of the screen asking to be stretched. 
And reproduction of music is one of the biggest tragones of energy. 
Few are mobile phones which they reproduce music more than ten or twelve hours, most much less. 
In this sense, the breeders of music (especially the simpler) have clearly better performance. 
Therefore, bear in mind that the cheap mobile not start quarrelling again more than two hours. 
If, in addition to this, above, will still be constantly call for more security, a barrel for the job - this is also valid for the appliances more expensive. 
Reproductive with MP3 players this problem is not going to have, because even the worst as minimum requirement 9 hours of continuous operation after a burden. 
Another problem is the recording music in the mobile. 
Unfortunately, only a part of the equipment available the universal conector USB and, moreover, not all of them can connect directly to the computer without a special software. 
It is, of course, possible recording music directly into the memory card, but only in some units without reducing readers can connect small memory cards used in mobile phones. 
In the breeders, with some exception (iPod), it is not necessary any special software. 
Enough to fill the apparatus with music through the computer USB. 
The majority of mobile and players create their own order at the music library under the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, gender or also according to the valuation of user. 
Some gadgets only show a board with a structure similar to a tree Buscador of Windows and some recognize both (iRiver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system). 
The reproductive tries to serve, the mobile knows more 
For the election of a specific team interest by the resistance of the accumulator, by the ability of memory, for the quality and the type of exit of sound and, of course, for the comfort of its handling. 
If you listen, above all, music as fund and will hear every day just a while, as in the trams, then Le enough with any mobile reflecting. 
What truly succeed in virtually any mobile. 
Should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or reproductive reproducing music. 
MP3 reproducing it all, and practically, nearly all the music that he will be in this format. 
It is among the most widespread and apart from him the absolute majority of devices reproducing music in WMA format. 
The less include the PCA format (format used by the company Apple and its iPod). 
The best mobile facilitates also, for example, the purchase of online music. 
Enough by means of the mobile Internet pages visit competent operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album. 
This service may be alone a weighty argument to acquire a mobile phone for music. 
Unfortunately, the supply of operators is miserable and most is limited only to the issues of fleeting success of the radios. 
Prices nor are the lowest. 
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of sale of music (whether by GSM, Internet and wireless Internet) in the future dominate the music industry. 
The majority of people always takes over a mobile phone. 
Whenever cares to hear something, they will find the mobile device in your pocket, whereas the reproductive MP3 players will be forgotten at home. 
However, even if it is always with a headset or, at least, the handsfree. 
If this is not so, can use an integrated reproductive that has virtually every mobile albeit as minimum reproductive an MP3 players. 
Probably the biggest advantage for many mobile phones with music will be its price. 
The normally cheaper cost less than three thousand. 
Between three and four thousand kroner can already buy a good Walkmans. 
Most of you will limit the absence of an entry for headphones classics. 
The best, even when it comes to the technical side, as phones equipped with an entry of 3.5 mm. For a headset classics, cost up to fifteen thousand. 
Again, the advantage of the players is not anything other than its easy service. 
Breeders simpler - no way necessarily the cheaper (see our selection) - The drives really any person. 
The minimum functions, its handling like the previous cassettes currents or also tocadiscos is obvious. 
Does not represent a threat in the sense that by mistake we conectemos Internet with mobile and, consequently, giant account for lowering of data. 
By what apparatus decide 
Even the cheapest mobile (for example, the Vodafone 527) generally have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, Micro SD, etc.). 
Even with the purchase of a proper card will reach the two thousand kroner. 
However, beware. 
The basic models, are usually equipped only with a card 2 GB of maximum capacity. 
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB. 
If you already has a mobile and wants to buy a cheap reproductive MP3 players, take a look at the Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, iRiver Emgeton or. 
According to the maximum capacity (as 2 GB) does not lack spend more than 1.1 kroner. 
If it is considered among the most demanding music lovers volunteer hand of the móviles-walkman more specialized (Sony Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have independent keys to MP3 what makes a service as comfortable as a reproductive himself. 
The most qualified of all is Sony Ericsson Mobile, whose line Walkmans are almost identical use as a reproductive independent MP3 players. 
The same service and the same category in terms of price, about four thousand kroner, but with a greater capacity of memory (until 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum output of up to 35 hours), Mark cited more Arria brings them MP3 players. 
The first virtual operator already going to arrive, this year, to the Czech Republic. 
Is probably 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is well developed and virtually all our operators offer services as its partners of Western Europe. 
However, here we still missing something - the virtual operator, that would force those to be cheaper. 
Probably not going to long in coming. 
Operators Czechs are part of the most expensive in Europe, we have already written in Mobil. Cz. 
The rest is also confirmed the office of the Czech telecommunications (ČTÚ) warned that the price of the SMS messages in our country is the most expensive of the entire Union. 
After recent steps by the European Commission in the field of the regulation of roaming rates are likely to come to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the mobile operators Czechs SMS that sent from abroad will be cheaper than if the sent from home. 
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, lack of competition that really want to fight. 
This probably we seem paradoxical, since we have three mobile networks and its high coverage is more than 100%. 
On the contrary, the mobile operators like complaining that the Czech market there is an extreme competition. 
It is also the President of the Council of the office of Czech telecommunications (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, already expressed that there is no longer any place in the Czech Republic for any other operator. 
It is probably true that for a classic operator with its own network no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, will be very difficult to find any frequency). 
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator. 
Precisely the entry of virtual operator in the mobile phone market brought a prominent drop in prices at which they should react too classic operators. 
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks as Tesco mobile or Virgin Mobile in the market in Britain is heard voices both beyond fashion as here. 
It showed that there is room for this type of operators and can succeed. 
Otherwise, there is no need to seek examples too far. 
In February this year, briefed them about the release of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland. 
Only after half a year, this operator managed to obtain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country. 
On the other hand, after Mobilking finds the group Penta which, apart from this, the Czech Republic is the owner of or: Fon. 
The advantage of virtual operators is in the possibility of concentrating on many more specific target groups. 
Furthermore, so that they can function effectively, enough with many fewer customers than a classic operator. 
Do not involve relatively large spending on construction, operation and maintenance of the network. 
In the world this kind of virtual operators normally emerge with low expenses - and offer so-called cheap SMS messages, however, are often contrasts with the supply of services more tailored. 
Thus, for example, Tesco offers SMS mobile in Britain at least half of cheap with regard to competition. 
However, as demonstrated by the example of Mobilking in Poland can be a good blow also bid for a nothing trivial target group. 
This operator is directed specifically to the man. 
"The right man chooses Mobilking - is the operator who likes and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, the CEO of mobile entertainment company, which works this virtual operator. 
It is difficult to say whether similar concept as Poland could thus in our country. 
This doubt Vodafone spokesman, Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small for access by segments in which they are the majority of virtual operators. 
Apart from the point of view of the supply of services is relatively saturated " 
In the Czech Republic, there is no possibilities, say the mobile operators 
However, it seems almost certain that if in the Czech Republic will be some virtual operator that will not be Mobilking. 
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech R. does not seem too hopeful. 
Rather, it is the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region, "said in a telephone conversation for Mobil. CZ, Jana Studničková, spokesman Penta financial group. 
Indirectly ensured that the existing mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic definitely is not inclined to this idea. 
Rather the opposite, try to do everything possible to avoid any potential competition. 
Interest on the launch of a mobile virtual operator already shows the GTS Novera group that wanted to take a further step forward to become a real competition in the field of Telefonica O2 customers of businesses. 
"We have a great interest in this, to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also of mobile telephones. 
And how much earlier, the better. 
With this possibility we have repeatedly found with all the Czechs mobile phone operators. 
Some of them have made progress in the meetings, "said the spokesman of the group, Pavel Kaidl. 
Then, perhaps destellan better times. 
It seems that, by official information, the first official operator would arrive possibly because at the end of the year. 
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence. 
"At this time we believe that the situation is suitable for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market. 
The Czech market compared with other market is a very specific. 
Until the present nobody has approached us with some serious and complex project in this field, "expressed for Mobil. CZ, Vlastimil Sršeň, Telefonica O2 spokesman. 
The specificity of the Czech market refer other operators. 
The spokesman, Martina from Kemrová exceptional, in accordance with the opinion of O2, adds: "Until now we have not registered any viable commercial project, bilaterally helpful, can continue to develop." 
And he adds: "in the network from it will be difficult to find any virtual operator until the end of the year. 
At this point it should be on the table some specific contract that possible study in so short horizon " 
Vodafone directing their attention instead to compliance with the requirements of a 3G licence. 
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in regard to the distribution of costs and infrastructure. 
Precisely what we see as the greatest contribution from the point of view of customers. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this field lies in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a rapid growth in the mobile Internet. " 
Offices responsible - with operators breakneck speed and meat 
The progress of the mobile operators can easily understand, but the entry of another operator would increase competition leading to a drop in prices and a drop in profits. 
Then why facilitate the entry to the competition? 
When operators want to achieve something, are capable of throwing a concert, proof of this is the agarrón when it emerged or: Fon. 
Perhaps the greatest pressure on the ČTÚ was at the time of the entry of or: Fon by T-Mobile society. 
Witness the public information accessible on the Web pages of the ČTÚ. 
But it is precisely now or: Fon serves as argument why not accept a virtual operator. 
Martina Kemrová adds to this: "Moreover, not so long ago that the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened to a fourth operator. 
With regard to the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player in the market would mean for him and, above all, large requirements for their services. " 
This is why this access to mobile operators is hugely disappointing due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body. 
Not only is the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence in intervening in the commercial contracts, unlike Britain and other developed countries. 
This is purely to the Office for the protection of commercial contracts (ÚOHS). 
However, she expressed his typical stance on this issue. 
"The entry of a virtual operator in the mobile phone market would be possible after ending a Convention on the lease of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile phone operator and a virtual operator. 
Until today no convention has been closed since the supply of potential interested rather was not sufficiently interesting for operators classics, "added to our question Kristián Chalupa, external relations department of the ÚOHS. 
These worded statements not surprised to representatives of the operators. 
For the offices must represent the interests of consumers is something more than a consideration, apart from this must observe that nobody to take advantage of its position in the market. 
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "abroad where they operate with virtual operators normality can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to falling prices of mobile telephony services." 
Obviously, the pressure on the proper functioning of the means of the market and falling prices do not fall within the interest of the ÚOHS. 
It really dramatically shocking throughout this case lies in dissonant reactions resulting from the three mobile operators. 
The question of whether it is really a coincidence, it offers alone. 
It is the same as with the price of gasoline at the pump because it is clear that it is the work of the accident and a hard fight for competition. 
"The office in this sense has found no signs of unfair competition, and therefore has no reason to somehow intervene. 
None of the operators has a dominant position therefore does not have a corresponding rise of responsibility for their actions in the market. 
The tools necessary to open the market of mobile telephony to virtual operators, rather, lacking, as well as telecoms regulators, "added to his answer Chalupa. 
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many sticking points. 
Obviously there is an analysis of relevant markets produced by the ČTÚ according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of the commercial tender a single market. 
In this kind of market operators of course none of the Czechs has a dominant position. 
But some legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator is always necessary agreement with the administrator of the network. 
And the operator of mobile telephony - with all its logic - has the monopoly on its network. 
Therefore, in a particular segment must necessarily be dominant. 
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for ÚOHS should represent a warning to the fact that three mobile operators are strikingly similar. 
The current complaints from those interested (inluida cited the GTS Novera society) show that in all negotiations with the operators will collide with many similar hindrance. 
Bear the responsibility in the ČTÚ trick is a fairly common in the field of telecommunications which the ÚOHS washes its hands in this whole affair. 
We found with him because in some cases alike. 
Unfortunately, recently was tabled a new amendment to the law of telecommunications for enlargement of the competence of the ČTÚ in the field of commercial contracts which took effect, even if a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve. 
This should know perfectly representatives of ÚOHS, but it is obvious that their interests are elsewhere. 
Everything is going well, when nobody looks 
At the same time, desapercibidamente continues to work something like a pseudovirtual operator in Czech mobile phone networks are already a few. 
Are companies that put their own prices for mobile telephony services, however, are only a part. 
Normally it is companies that engage in the multi-level marketing. 
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services. 
Usually only a few elected get the list prices of these companies. 
The magic is in the company, with regard to the operator, acts as a classic business customer just putting a lot of SIM cards. 
As special client will receive after special prices and other offerings. 
The problem is that trading conditions in all the Czechs mobile phone operators prohibit such re-sale. 
"If you discovered cases such as those quotes could speak of breach of contract in conditions that could translate into the end of collaboration with society given," replied to the question about this problem Kemrová Martina. 
But it is unlikely that an activity of this kind conducted by mobile phone operators not to reach people responsible. 
Precisely in the case of the three companies involved can come to be thousands of customers. 
None of the operators is against this procedure. 
With the activities of these companies make gains nothing contemptible, and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - no way threaten its own marketing official. 
Miroslav Čepický warns us about the potential problems: "The law allows this kind of speculation, however, services of this company are used only by a small percent of customers. 
These, moreover, must accept that the SIM card in your phone is not his name so that they cannot have absolutely him as a client of the "normal operator. 
This is exactly what it should look to the ČTÚ slightly strange. 
Moreover, there is a new question for the ÚOHS. 
If the mobile phone operators entornan eyes in this type of procedure, why is blocking the entrance to the virtual operator? 
It is necessary to add that the ÚOHS has sufficient competition to discover this type of activities and if it is not going to want must not be content with the explanations of the operators that have no idea of this story and its trading conditions do not allow it. 
When will be the most expensive 
As it became clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator in the mobile phone market brought a significant drop in prices of services. 
At the same time, in virtually all countries where emerged the virtual operator, the traditional operators tried to more or less protect themselves from this outbreak. 
The arguments used by these were virtually identical - all too small a market, eventually, too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc. 
In the most advanced countries, however, in these moments have intervened regulators and none of the cases defended the operators but to their customers. 
With measures already outside formal or informal pressure ensured that the first virtual operator and he began to emerge with others. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory body of all this case what passes as if it were a nail ablaze. 
For our experience we cannot fail to impress ourselves that the confusion of powers in these cases is best for them. 
But we do not desesperemos. 
If this information is correct and the scenes virtual operator reaches these lands, then the Czech market mobile telephony probably begin to move again. 
If any of the leaves operators to enter any mobile virtual operator will be difficult for the ÚOHS can remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested. 
And perhaps we will draw more expensive than in the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech anthem has four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the official anthem Czech. 
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of celebrations Czech official presented the new recording where official anthem, my home. 
The new anthem recorded what the Orchestra of the National Theater under the direction of Bělohlávek Jiří. 
There are four versions available - two versions that are alone, one male voice and other female voice, another with chorus and another instrumental. 
The song is responsible Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka. 
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček. 
The iHNed server. Cz can listen to the four versions. 
Bělohlávek considers this song national Czech as one of the most beautiful tunes. 
The Czech radio already said earlier that intentionally chose for the singers themselves with young representativamente voices that are heartfelt and popular. 
"From the beginning I have tried with the two and then, too, with the chorus that is set in the dicción so that the text was understood to have line," commented. 
The official anthem Czech celebrates its 175 anniversary next year. 
The song, rang where my home for the first time in the year 1834 at the tables of the theatre of states in the original Czech labour Fidlovačka of Josef Kajetán Tyl and managed with the music of Škroup František. 
He won popularity and the people did. 
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in the year 1918 became, naturally, in a part of the official anthem. 
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic. 
How "Fresh" anthem sounds 
The Prague MHD leads us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip 
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, writes in the history of the transport company of Prague, the date by which the first passengers enter the subway, tram and bus with an electronic Bono in their pockets instead of a paper ticket. 
This can be acquired in these moments for almost a hundred thousand people who possess the Opencard chip card. 
Passengers can buy the Bono 30 days, 90 days and the annual (it will be applied from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously carry it in its chip card in the infocentros and posts the transport company in the subway stations, muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka. 
You can buy bonds since yesterday on the Internet in the pages of the transport company, the worldwide web. DPP. Cz. 
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people. 
Those who begin to use the Internet as a form of trade, can begin definitively to forget the posts of ticket sales in the subway stations, where until now regularly had to queue to get a normal ticket. 
The Bono is bought on the Internet, and the Opencard card you simply add in some of the thirteen subsidiaries of the municipal library. 
"In these places are available for passengers with a one-stop shop staff prepared that helps those interested in buying over the Internet and also with the aquifer the Bono bought in your card," said the spokesman, Martin Opatrný project. 
Apart from the library, will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus in the Opencard in automatic vending machines that are in some vestibules Metro. 
How are these machines? 
They are red, remind us to a machine of bite notes and passengers will probably already fixed on them in Metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská. 
"There is now in the town five but at the end of the year would be 80," completed Opatrný. 
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver 
The use of the machine, which will begin to work tomorrow, is simple. 
Enough to introduce into the Opencard chip card and Bono previously paid will be charged only in it. 
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid, not only in the capital, but also in their vicinity. 
That is to say, on trains and buses to bypass lines from the numbers 300 to 499 who use mainly the inhabitants of the villages of Central Bohemia. 
"In trains affiliated to the integrated transport of Prague revisores is equipped with a card reading that help confirm the validity of the time and the area of Bono," it explained the control of banknotes, Filip Drápal Ropid organization that establishes the hours of public transport in Prague. 
Buses to bypass their cards have mounted in the box-office readers of the driver. 
To enter is necessary not only show the card to the driver, but it is also necessary to accompany it with the Opencard in the place allocated to it at the side of the box. 
With this, the driver controls the validity of the Bono. 
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of bonds nothing easier than to ask the driver this information," Drápal completed. 
Passengers not to travel on buses to bypass them and not remember when it ends the validity of the Bono can address the vending machines which are simply add cards. 
Here, the screen of the machine, they will show the information on the validity of his document. 
The Southeast wanted to form part of the USA in a referendum. 
Asked Sudeten Germans in 1945 that smoked form part of the United States. 
This is what is extracted from the charter that is stored in the collection of the scientific library of southern Bohemia. 
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least live under the patronage of the United States of America. 
With this desire is directed, presumably, some groups of Sudeten Germans to the President of the USA in 1945. 
It is in the cards, which are stored in a particular file and which are now sitting in the collection of the library science Southern Bohemia. 
The Germans of Český Krumlov request in a letter to the American president will not allow the return of the "Earth Šumava" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of Munich Pact - again to Czechoslovakia. 
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want his word that American units are coming to German land not as oppressors nor enemies but as liberators" writes in the charter, signed with a "people who leads the fate of Šumava in his heart." 
In view of the Union of Czechoslovakia with the South East Germans presumably supposed - according to the Czech national character -- a hope alone in the brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors are begging in the letter to the American president who takes on today and forever to Šumava under a protectorate. 
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants give us a foreign state which oppresses and rejects minorities and that works with the victory of the allies," they wrote in the letter. 
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals "oppressors Czechs." 
If the president of USA presumably was doubtful about on this idea of Germans šumavos, enough in the land šumavas organizing a referendum on whether their residents want to be part of the USA or live under his patronage. 
Despite the fact that the text of the letter, with the knowledge we have today's post-war history, we may sound a little child, according to some specialists rightly portrays expectations of Germans from the south-east of then. 
Although the Germans Czechs were minimally intuition is going to discuss his expulsion from the Republic only a few admit this possibility. 
Some waited for the United States and Britain negotiated for Sudeten clear some form of autonomy. 
Others believed that will be in Czechoslovakia. 
What confirms even the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice. 
This was in the war, as German Budějovice, enrolado in the Navy in the Baltic Sea. 
When, at the end of the war as apresaron Britons and emplazaron in the field of prisoners steer tens of Germans were he to Czech boy. 
"They believed that to return home, the Czech suit them," said Chalupa. 
None of the prisoners Germans who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, was that on the basis of the Benes decrees would be removed from the Republic. 
Not together - fee-paying! 
Drivers emotional campaign attacks 
The most expensive action in the Czech history aimed at the safety on the roads. 
That way we could characterise the emotional campaign that decided to launch on Wednesday the Ministry of Transportation in the media. 
The office of Prime Minister, Aleš Řebíček promises that will deter drivers dangerous behaviour behind the wheel. 
The campaign of 150 million will be felt on television, radio, the Internet and in movies, brochures. 
Would deter the driver of the high speed and alcohol at the wheel. 
And also to remind you that before they get underway strap belts. 
Wants to reach the conscience, especially of the young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and in last place also of professional drivers. 
And what is what we see in advertisements? 
Fundamentally human stories that embisten to emotions. 
And for this we witnessed by advertisements "bloodthirsty" throughout the campaign. 
Not together - fee-paying! 
The word "no" is written together with large letters in the plate. 
And in a pond of blood is the word "fee-paying." 
This must symbolize the man in a moment of error may come to pay with their own lives. 
The announcements are to "put fear" viewers until 2010. 
The ministry was inspired by the campaign made in Anglo-Saxon land where you can see strong images of accident victims. 
Promises that this way reduce accidents and the number of deaths on the roads Czech. 
Advertisements have been produced by the agency Euro RSCG. 
Sugar and whip for drivers 
"for drivers is the system of sugar and whip. 
Sugar is for him when, for example, is a red light and thus saves time. 
The whip is threat of fine or accident. 
Drivers they should remember the risks, "says the psychologist transport of the hospital Na Homolce, Martin Kořán. 
And this is why we need an information campaign in the press and mainly negative publicity concrete, the psychologist. 
Less effective, for him, are the panels to warn the driver of the dangers. 
"If there is some panel installed warning of any danger probably soon will be merged with the environment and the driver would not pay more attention," he warned Kořán. 
Olmert revive almost all the occupied areas in exchange for peace. 
The president of the interim government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, decided on the restitution of virtually all the land occupied in 1967, the year, i.e., the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Golan Heights in return for peace with the Palestinians and Syria. 
Proposed in the interview that the Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. 
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we must necessarily restore almost all the land occupied (), if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper. 
"I am sure we will be left with a percent of these lands, but the Palestinians must give them a percent similar (of the land of Israel) because without that there will be no peace," he added. 
He admitted that in case of restitution would also include East Jerusalem. 
"Anyone who wants to security in Jerusalem and therefore do not want that tractors or bulldozers pass above his legs as he became one of my best friends, then it will have to surrender part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in reference to the two attacks of July in the city in which there were several dead and dozens of people were injured. 
According to the president will need to find "a special solution to the Hill, the temple sacred place and historic" that lies in the interior of the old city. 
"Anyone who wants to maintain the Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs. 
This will not work, "insisted later. 
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights 
Olmert was also by Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights which from their point of view is inherently a condition for closing a peace agreement with Syria. 
But this would also a concrete efforts by Damascus. 
"I am not suggesting closing peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan Heights," he warned. 
"The Syrians know well what will have to be shorn to win the Golan Heights. 
Should abandon its current relations with Iran, to abandon its relations with the Hezbollah movement (secretly), must be shorn of permanent support that causes terror movement Hamas (secretly), the al Qaeda terrorist network (the) and jihad (holy war) in Iraq, "quite the prime minister. 
Questions after the accident: are illegal the stewardesses in buses? 
The law is unknown, cannot walk in a long-distance bus 
In connection with the tragic accident of the bus company student agency near the Italian city of Padova we the question arises of whether the hostesses and passengers can move by the bus for the trip. 
"If we were strict and formally comply with the law, the activity of the hostess opposes the Road Traffic Act," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident in which died last week, the hostess of twenty-two years, obviously was caused by the driver of the truck only that the bus sat in the road. 
The girl, unfortunately, was granted to the side of the driver in the place less sure the vehicle despite having reserved two other sites. 
However, the bus may have an accident or stop suddenly, and at the very moment that the azafato distributes coffee or newspapers. 
Here he plays the role is if the bus is endowed, according to the technical permit, with places. 
If the bus is not harmonized, the passenger must be granted. 
Long-distance buses of student agency sites do not have to go on foot, which confirmed the director of the company, Radim Jančura, Aktuálně. Cz. 
"We have settled with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed. 
Finally this withdrew and reach the agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus in place if they possess seat, "commented us his position. 
The hostess knows no law 
"There is a clear legal interpretation of the role of the hostess - no legal provision clarifies this function. 
Even any legal provision prohibits agents make some transport service. 
The law of road transport only knows the end of Department of vehicles, whose rights and obligations are not defined, "adds, less strongly, the spokesman Hanzelka. 
The director of the Department of traffic by road from the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks that the law sufficiently responds this problematic. 
"depends on whether the bus has the type-approval permitted to have sites. 
That is all, "he says. 
Buses are divided between the urban, where there are places to be standing and limited top speed, mainline with sites to be standing with greater speed permit and long distances without places to go up, with the greatest permission of speed and with seats equipped with safety belts. 
As the plane, expert says. 
The BESIP expert on safety in transport, Jaroslav Hořín, not seen major problems with regard to the movement of the azafato in the bus. 
"During the development of the journey there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared with the service in aircraft. 
Even here is the safety of the turbulence and the hostess can be hit in the head ". 
"However, if the bus stops suddenly obviously that are valid physical laws. 
The same as on an urban bus or the tram. 
The safety of the hostess must solve the internal rules of the carrier, "says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problematic is unresolved. 
Jančura is prepared to overrule this service. 
Student agency is the only carrier that offers the service of stewardesses. 
It employs in hundred. 
The director, or after the accident, considers that risky work. 
"However, when we have the impression that the post of hostess is risky, then add it. 
The coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, to enter. 
Save even expenses, "he says. 
In the interests of security is why Asiana lacks stewardesses in their vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line in comparison with SA. 
"We have no stewardesses, we are against them from the beginning. 
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident, "said less than a year ago to Týden. Cz. 
An enormous tragedy happened 
In the accident on the line that unites Naples died a young hostess of Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years. 
A Slovenian truck that probably issued from the parking lane blocking the way to the bus. Without using the intermittent. 
His driver tried in a quick move to avoid it, however, collided with the right way. 
Jančura denies that were sold the two sites that are reserved for the rest of the hostess. 
"These sites is not possible connections reserving them for long distances, are blocked." 
The company intends to sue the driver of the lorry. 
The agency is not going to wait for the verdict of the judgment about compensation for the family of the girl but expected financial expenses also on the part of the blame. 
How reform of the law? 
Not now, 
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the movement of the hostess at the bus in which since a year ago that experts are working 30 members of a group of the Ministry of Transport. 
"However, have not reached any conclusion. 
Do not spend too much on buses, but rather at the system of points, maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile during the march, "said the expert Hořín. 
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewardesses something so important that threaten the safety of passengers," the spokesman Hanzelka ending, that control of security in buses is competition from the police and the office of safety in the workplace. 
The hope of Dusseldorf rests in Frankfurt 
In the letter of the board of the Bank West LB for their collaborators there is no shortage of big words. 
By merging units of the Bank of Dusseldorf with the bank Deka 'can be formed a central market capital of the financial group Sparkassen ", as it says the paper, published Monday 
The Bank West LB, breaking the Bloco 'competition' with sustainable capacity of benefits would enter into such business. 
Moreover, such a merger could be a start for following mergers in the field of regional banks. 
This comes to understand the text, when a board wants to show the ability to act in tough times. 
As before, because the West LB is under enormous pressure. 
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also the Federal Institute for surveillance of financial services that recently has made it clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia left little time to find a solution. 
Since some time ago, also on the part of Frankfurt, there is much talk about the Union of this kind between the Bank Deka, which customers Sparkasse known for their investment funds, and West LB. 
To tell the truth, Franz WAAS, the head of the bank Deka, presenting the data after a half a year at the end of August left knowing that sees no sense in the merger of the bank, located in the street Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank Helaba, such as, for example, or the West LB. 
But the board of Deka, which now is composed of the regional banks and associations of Sparkassen, commissioned to board to begin negotiations with the West LB on the common commercial activities. 
In this could treat a business in the capital market, or some parts of it. 
Of course, the negotiations have only just begun, as stated in the financial site. 
This is not the first time when it comes to the consolidation in the field of Sparkassen is the name of the bank Deka that with its 3,000 collaborators figure among the most important financial site entrepreneurs in Frankfurt. 
In 2003 at a time the situation seemed so that the bank Deka could merge with the regional bank Rhineland-Palatinate and with Helaba. 
This initiative to create a Union of three parties was without results. 
Only the plans were made public, the government of Hesse was expressed against the participation of Helaba in this project. 
The other two banks also not found the same language. 
Instead, the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate began dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg. 
But it always played again with the idea of merging the bank Deka with other regional banks. 
But finally Günter Merl, the president of the board of the Helaba, expressed that he was against the plans of coexistence with their bank. 
Independent of that seems to be more clear that the Union of the various banks of the field of public law is necessary. 
Therefore, when going to pass the parliament elections in Bavaria, the Union with the regional bank BayernLB Baden-Württemberg could make progress. 
For the Helaba this is not necessarily good news. 
If the pressure will continue merging Helaba, you will be missing the partners to do that. 
In the south, the bank could be only a junior partner, although until now sobresalió much better than the financial crisis that did buildings of Stuttgart and Munich. 
On the other hand the Sparkassen - and Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85% of the Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided plans of coexistence with the West LB. 
In any case it is only the Nord lb. 
But such thoughts geostrategic form are only a part. 
On the other hand is the compatibility of the different banking models. 
In June Merl made a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, the Deutsche Sparkassen - and turn - Verband until now not gave no response. 
In end you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, is not the desire of the bank. 
Thus, also in the Charter of the board of the bank said that it would try to find a comprehensive solution for the entire bank 
As you can combine the coexistence between unique parts of the bank with Deka, this goes to show the time. 
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of Italians" 
Elena is for the first time, to Luca the third or fourth. 
But this time, he attends Elena as his girlfriend, and that is why everything looks different, he says. 
Behind them, on the side of a barrel of 5 litres of beer brand of Kaiser is built a huge Tiger bear that shows nearly 200 participants of Oktoberfest that sounds low knows produce in his throat. 
First Elena gives Luca a pat, after a kiss. 
Bologna arrived in Verona. 
From there, the parking lot at the side of the train station told Nuova, tonight at the 23: 45 out three buses, 'direction in Munich, the festival of beer ", predictable arrival at 6: 30 in the morning. 
Three buses are intended mainly for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians. 
In one corner of the garage at the side of its flag are singing the South American, they had already begun to celebrations of night. 
With a great deal of noise, says Mark observed, which is nothing for the Italians. 
In that context, wearing a long coat with a fur forro artificial and glasses with color Patillas silver belong, these buses. 
Since five years ago they come at the Oktoberfest, bearing in mind that this year alone there are three trips. 
One night in the road there during the day in the meadow, at 10.30 the round. 
Spend the night there means only unnecessary expenditure, says framework. 
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome reception with a beer Kaiser was made, according to the law of the purity of Bavaria, health insurance and guide in German - framework attended a course of language in Frankfurt. 
For night buses are already on the road in the direction "with the Brenner motorway" 
There is no beer, still not. 
Quickly Tranquillity reigns in the bus, passengers are sleeping. 
OK, they will still need the forces. 
It for Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian fees make a another pause in the motorway shortly before 8 in Munich. 
Finally, when the group of framework has scheduled arrival to the late-night low-capacity in the parking lot at the side of the meadow of Theresa, where there are already other circa 50 buses throughout Europe. 
Elena, Luca and the other meet, framework has his last speech on how to proceed. 
First: Put yourselves a yellow hats. 
There, the left is written "Oktoberfest," to the side in gothic print is page of the Office of Travel framework in the Internet: "conoscersiviaggiando. It." 
Second: "When you opened the door of the shop of the campaign, that means we go!," shouts framework in the morning. 
"Go!" March and fill the back sites in the shop of the campaign. 
"Don't take sites in front, because we shall block, and all with yellow baseball sentéis shall not in the same dock, spread throughout space!" 
A pint of beer, roars framework, costing 8.25 euros. 
Not forget the tip 
You show the people of security that we have good tone! 
It barely gets out of his seat, he will be occupied! " 
Third: "This afternoon at exactly the ten and a half that coming here!" Do you understand? 
And now all go to the Oktoberfest. 
One, to mark the way, ties the yellow baseball in trees, traffic signs and even in an election poster of a great popular party of Bavaria. 
You want to recognize the way back. 
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, which is known as "the weekend Italians" 
There are no precise data on the number of people; it is about 50,000 people who make the journey over the Alps and tormentosamente enter the tents, 10% of all came especially this weekend of Italy. 
The police of Munich receives help from seven policemen of the autonomous province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers to help the Red Cross of Bavaria that makes a statistic of nations here, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical attendance, in front of the English (nearly 60 attendance) and the Austrians in the first place. 
The preferred shop of the campaign of Italians is so-called Hofbräuzelt. 
The nights without sleep for creditors of the Hypo Real is yourself 
The banking system of Germany is relatively stable, acentuó only last week the Federal Minister of Finance Peter Steinbrück. 
Well, that political using the word "relatively" and added that the German banking sector will also be affected trends criticism. 
And this has happened after weekend. 
Hypo Real is yourself (HRE) Financial, the estate of Munich, which is priced in the index DAX, receives a consortium of German banks a $1 billion credit to do resistance to the turbulence in the market. 
On Monday, a person who is very familiar with the situation told Reuters: credit aid amounted to 35 billion euro. 
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real is you will use must shed interest. 
The money comes as private banks also of public law. 
The cause of this are the losses of the subsidiary Depfa. 
According to a report, the state financing with the money that was paid for the long-term projects financed the only a brief period - what now, because of distrust in the markets, there is more possible. 
In the first half of the year, the Reserve Bank capital in cash has fall into a 95 percent, 2.37 million euro, also the share of equity held back a little bit of a 1.6 percent to a 1.45 percent. 
In comparison with the same period last year the continuing financial investment income and net profit of financial operations fell to zero, the incomes of charging for debtors and some titles of values also supplies the dissolution of the business of credit have tended to decline more than 70%, 5 million euro. 
Only thanks to high income and many of the reimbursement of expenses of compensation for the restructuring of the ex-grupo Depfa as well as to the reimbursement of interests under the federal tax code and business organized for businesses of the consortium, the negative balance could charge a deficit with approximately 16 percent more. 
After their privatisation in the year 1990 former state financial initially was lost in speculation with loans to the industrial estate, which served reason for foundation Aareal Bank. 
As could not earn a lot of money with the financing of the state projects, Defa began to engage intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of Community projects by private investors and state as well as Private-Public-Partnership (PPP) and diversificó. 
Now the Hypo Real is you have to make repayments on the value of the subsidiary which will have a material effect "essential" consolidated on account of losses and gains of the group, says very these thinkers -- often imprecisely. 
It is a fact that have cancelled dividends. 
As for the year 2007 they were cancelled two thirds. 
After the acquisition of the Hypo real Depfa is you became an important financial financial state and in the field of infrastructure. 
As the bank owns no customer deposits, he, in comparison with other banks, turns out to be more dependent on the refinancing in the interbank market. 
With the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers, what has happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans fell essentially because banks were saving their liquidity. 
Each year the Hypo Real is yourself needs nearly 50 billion to finance a portion of credit portfolios of DEFA their short-term measures for refinancing. 
According to the report of the Hypo Real is you, the bank covers with a loan the need to finance the group for a brief time and the company is assured of "The influence of the international money markets that are now essentially are not suitable for work" 
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009. 
Georg Funke, the president of the board of the Hypo Real is yourself, explained that the Hypo real group is you would not need currency markets for the foreseeable future. 
The German central bank and the Federal Institute for surveillance of financial services (BaFin) from the basis that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real is yourself group from now on is assured. 
This must wait shareholders and creditors of the bank. 
But because of the dynamics and imponderables the crisis there is no record. 
Even it is conceivable that does not need funding in its full volume. 
But we cannot exclude the case. 
Running the voice of that in the last hour of Sunday the bank still was almost in insolvency, hence the temporary salvation nor can at least reassure people worried. 
The price of action fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros. 
The courses of loan, by contrast, are really well. 
While the priority debts almost unchanged, courses of borrowing according to the position in the registration of property clearly tend downwards. 
Particularly affected are borrowing from the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and with reason borrowing whose maturity beyond 2009. 
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and DEPFA acquisition of that affected the Hypo Real is you, the current value of its borrowings that were previously an investment for speculation is regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system. 
While the central banks, governments and banks are little affected are still ready to support the system, meanwhile can be from the amortization of pensions within the deadline. 
Or something is going to happen, what risks not imagine anyone - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months. 
But watching the news crusades on the estatización biased, now the security that is already in your limit became a hope justified. 
This is going to be a reason, because creditors will pass the nights without sleep, breaking the head on the decision on its isolation of enthusiasm. 
Still short-term investors can put the final point and use the new transport to account for losses to close tax payment of compensation benefits on the change in the future. 
Sylvana and the secrets of the bent - box? 
When the first day Hiltrop Sylvana, 16 year-old girl, had to stand in highschool of Tachibana girls began to laugh: the German is totally "kawaii"! 
What does that mean? 
Sylvana knows the word of sleeves - in a report on exchanges her account Japan. 
"The first day at a college in Japan. 
I felt nervous. 
Even before going to the college was afraid. 
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the Kawasaki direction and I am 40 minutes by train to highschool Tachibana. 
One had to find the path, fortunately I lost. 
It seems that the start of classes is not set as rigorously as in my home, in Lower Saxony. 
Of the eight in the morning come students, at least twenty nine starts a small meeting with teachers, the 'home room ". 
Before the class began, I had come to present Me. 
Furthermore I am not a person who speaks with happy in the public, especially in a class of 40 pupils. 
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirts of the mother of my family host and a blouse blue socks and shoes, black leather. 
Therefore, so clothed I started the pulpit and I tried to make everything in the right way: "Sayonara wo she Sylvana..." -- I call Sylvana, I am of Germany and in a week is my birthday. 
At this point I was very happy because from two years ago had begun to study this language. 
All 31 girls in the class cuchicheado, have fun and signalling and all the time I have heard the word "kawaii" 
The knew of my sleeves. 
That belongs to the vocabulary of survival of Japanese girls and means "Mona, Linda" 
Then I deslicé rapidly in my room. 
The girl in the side had a big smile, for it was an honor that the girl of Exchange had to sit on the side of it. 
The rest of the class was fairly calm, but when the gong rang, I felt really pounced. 
All spoke at the same time, reían and made many questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand English of Japanese. 
After all, in the recreational out their Bentos. 
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for my - is something other than boring pieces of bread Germans. 
Have rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad, fruit and algae and something like meat in droves of tofu. 
In the majority of cases have no idea what as here in Japan. 
Things are rare and have a new flavor. 
What is certain is that everything is very rich. 
Therefore, perhaps with the exception of plum marinadas in the salt, bufff! 
In the Bentos Japanese schools are not simply a lunch. 
It sometimes happens that a girl prepares a Bento done very artistic way for a boy and given away in hope of being able to know him better during a recreation. 
On this I read in my Manga-Comics. 
I am very curious to see if I can see it here. 
"Why precisely Japan?", I have asked my friends when I said that I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend a year school. 
Then always responded: 
"Well, because it fascinates me." 
Finally from years ago I prefer to read sleeves. 
To understand better the comics and culture, one day began to look a bit of Japanese. 
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I will travel there. 
Also because I am a disservice by tradition and customs. 
Here they have a great value. 
A part of the Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, another part is a country tough, disciplined and traditional. 
As everything is well organised, yet I felt lost here, although Tokyo is the largest city that I have ever seen in my life. " 
Also the rats have feelings 
It says that a rat or a Cucaracha sensing danger flee, why has also fear? 
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of Neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings. 
How can you check whether they, behaving in a way similar to us, feel the same? 
In an Internet magazine called "Edge" since many years are published contributions of scientists famous. 
Spiegel Online presents a series responses elected to the question, what do you think what is truth without being able to prove it? 
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without which I or anybody else could prove until now, although we cannot even prove that other people have a conscience. 
But in this case, at least we can hope it, because all human brains have the same fundamental shape. 
But as soon as we spend on other species and include questions about the sense and in general on the conscience, entering the field unknown because the hardware is not. 
When a rat is in danger, the same as the other animals: becomes the dead, flee or attacks. 
People behave in a similar way, what some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience. 
Of course I do not think so. 
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transmit our subjective experience to the animals. 
First, they almost always include Associated circuits for human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the brain cortex (because of its participation in the short memory and executive functions that directs conduct). 
This part wide is much more developed in the case of people than the other primates and seems to lack absolutely in other creatures. 
Bearing in mind at least aspects concerning our awareness that depends on the prefrontal lobe of the brain cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability of plotting and decide, there is a reason to assume that even the man differs from the other primates. 
One another peculiarity lies in the linguistic nature of man: like most of his experience is united with the language, that often means that awareness depends on it. 
In this case, can exclude the animals. 
But even when the conscience does not depend on language, the impact so that the conscience of animals, created whatever, in many cases would differ from most of our states of consciousness. 
Why it is difficult to explain how it works the awareness of other animals. 
If that, as something interesting and subjective, nor does it measure because it leaves the special hardware, nor leaves look through our experience, so their research presents us with big problems. 
The majority of my speeches refers to the content of the consent experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of an awareness that ought to be easier for scientific research. 
We could investigate the processes of conscience of animals without taking account of their content, and that is what happens during the short memory primate studies, especially in the example of the implementation. 
But with this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick basics passes rather the correlatos neutral awareness that the causal mechanisms: the two can be such or not. 
Interestingly this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the brain cortex to the formation of the display. 
And what is that for the feelings? 
I like the fact that the emotional system is activated a part of the brain that is responsible for this, what is happening with fear. 
What they describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defence system (or its consequences such as for example the reactions of the body). 
Seen from this point of view the feelings are very determined to part of the brain cortex what distinguishes primates and above all the man. 
From the point of view of a linguistic nature still rankings of the fine feeling because we can differentiate and classifying the states with the help of words and grammar to describe the states of others to couple of ourselves. 
For example, Antonio Damascus, by contrast, thinks that the feelings stem from simple activities of the parts of the brain cortex responsible for feelings of bodily and the brain, the same syllabus thinks Jaak Pankseep, but focuses more on the stump brain. 
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely different types and their feelings. 
For reasons teoréticas cannot go against this, but what I think is not likely. 
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that sits in two cases also: But how can be controlled if rats and men behaving similarly feel the same? 
Seeing the danger a Cucaracha flee, because he is afraid? 
I am of the opinion that the similarity of the behavior still does not test the similarity of experience. 
It is true that the neural comparison aid: rats and men have similar brain floating timber from cucarachas, on the other hand does not have at least one brain. 
Is the core of the brain that is responsible for feelings? 
Even when possible to prove it for men: how can you prove it in case of rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, possibly also the cucarachas (who knows?), have feelings. 
But I do not know how it can prove it. 
I prefer to investigate emotional behaviour of rats that emotional feelings because their feelings supposedly distinguished fundamentally of us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language). 
In any case, we expect progress in the field of Neurology in both that measured the same of rats and men. 
As not investigo language and awareness of rats, as well as sensation, I do not know if they exist. 
You can say that I cannot see beyond my nose, but I prefer to move that permanent work without results. 
Well, I am emocionalista practical. 
The UEFA president Platini: grace period for Poland and the Ucraina

"We cannot lose more time. 
We now have to work with great speed, "said the president of an association Ukraine Grigorij Surkis. 
"UEFA will not take the eyes of us." 
In Poland was agreed a more radical step.

In an interview last week with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was long infidel to me, and that was very painful." 
She knew the size of his have been unfaithful only after divorce. 
The reason for the revelation of private things was the work of Ryan with the press for his new film "The Women" -- tells a story of the breakdown of a marriage. 
Dennis Quaid's reaction to the appointment of him as a husband infidel was clear: this is a preposterous "that Meg few times account the history of our relationship in a another version," said the man of 54 years "New York Daily News". 
Among other things it is very "regrettable" that Jack, his son of 16 years, again "is going to remember in public the pain and changes, which means a divorce for a child." 
While Ryan after divorce lives alone, Quaid is again recently married and time is Pope of twins. 
And so ends with his statement highlighting: "whatever is my life continues. 
I am happy because I have a wonderful family that is well. "

Not step nothing special in the catacombs, rest time ended and the majority of the present was again on their websites. 
Rieger was almost during three decades of HSV physiotherapist, enjoys the very big reputation as one of those who were part of the group. 
That is why his request was observed a person responsible. 
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach asintió with the head and lifted the fingers in a sign of approval. 
Cornelius is brother of Martin Jol, the main coach in Hamburg. 
His order was the same: Oh, the second goal! 
But this was not done. 
"Today, not everything was nice to see," he added later Marcell Jansen. 
Bastian also Reinhard had wanted to have it "more relaxed". 
The result 1: 0 (1: 0) the Hamburg must thank Mladen Petric (11) with its impact of head; and also to the situation that the team of Gladbach very weak could not show their full strength to the weak team of Hamburg.

Projected partial descriptions of the table correspond to the attempt of the league that the dominance of its HSV. 
The quipo with their players forced late as Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goleador Petric as Jansen was removed from FC Bayern need time to come together, but still the quipo cannot shine with its successes. 
"We need more of the feeling and dribbling," requires Jol.

Dark matter influences the trajectory of the space probes 
Since many years ago a phenomenon mysteries cause confusion researchers: the dark matter impacts the speed of the space probes during so-called gravity assistance to manoeuvre. 
Experts fear that the theory of relativity of Albert Einstein cannot be so right. 
The space probe "Ulysses" spent nearly 18 years flying in the universe. 
Because of the fuel pipes are now be helando him a death threat in the cold. 
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the assistance of gravity to manoeuvre, causing confusion among researchers. 
The assistance of gravity is a manoeuvre the trajectory of the space probes during which they get an acceleration using the energy of the field of gravity of a planet, for example on Earth. 
This allows the space probes to save fuel. 
The Cassini-Huygens probe EU-USA space this trick used physical as well as did the probe of the sun Ulysses. 
But what the surprise to researchers for many years: the missiles not behave by 100 percent as it expects according to the venerable law of gravitación. 
More frequent violations of the speed. 
Suddenly the probes has more or less speed. 
Physicists could not explain this effect until now. 
He called the anomaly during the assistance of gravity to manoeuvre. 
Some experts fear that possibly even the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein who describes the force of attraction of the matter by the curvature of the space may not be so right. 
Stephen Adler, an American physicist of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton believes solemnly now as before Einstein not confused and try to explain the anomaly assistance during the gravity with the help of so-called dark matter, in what were the astrónomos in the universe. 
"The reason for the anomaly can be dark matter that can also be very close to the Earth," he writes. 
Researchers in the universe is aware of the existence of dark matter only for ten years. 
Presumably it possesses the force of attraction and their influence can be observed in other planets. 
The dark matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that sends and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light. 
According to the calculations of scientists dark matter makes at least a fifth of the total mass of the universe. 
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free

Five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as his eight Egyptian guides are well and are in security, the Egyptian state television reports. 
The 19 participants of the expedition in the desert are on the way to Cairo. 
What is incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages: according to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard the hijackers were ready to terminate the abduction, but the army of Sudan suddenly had killed six hijackers. 
"The problem was solved. 
They agreed with the rescue, "said the guard. 
It was only "to receive the hostages" when suddenly came "this surprise". 
Sunday Sudanese soldiers have killed six hijackers and two of them have been detained in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt. 
The captors have demanded in Germany the rescue in the amount of six million euros; the money had to deliver the German wife of one of the hostages. 
The newspaper El Masri "the Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release is holding back because the hijackers had fear of his safety. 
According to the report the hijackers have the intention to liberate the hostages femeniles after having received the rescue. 
The men had to remain in custody until the hijackers had a safe route to flee. 
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected take the position with regard to this report.

The Royal Court of Truro, through a study indagatorio, known that he regularly had tied to his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years. 
Trerise wrote in a role of confession: "I am responsible for his death." 
The court met that Mrs Randle committed suicide at his home in Plymouth Mutley, 1 April 2007, at the age of 34 years. 
In a season in which the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used tie it and vendar her eyes before conducting their sexual acts, while their mother was working in a pub.

His hijastra moved to Plymouth. 
However, the court known that Mrs Randle, who used much of his time working as a voluntary for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse he had inflicted twice per week. 
In 2006, the prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Mrs Rande had said it, having been a great a surfer and cyclist, now seemed "emotionally dead", as if he had "renounced life." 
In April 2007, his real father, Randle terrace, the woman found dead in his apartment in Plymouth.

Mr Randle faced the padrastro of his daughter, who wrote a letter of confession that concludes by saying: "I used to tie it and ventarle eyes. 
It was never a sexual assault. 
I am responsible for his death. " 
Judge Christopher Elwen at Trerise replied: "You are a very strange abnormally attached, and his victim must have been a frightening experience, especially when we only had seven years. 
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim be taking his own life. 
Even more clear, is that if she would not have done so, probably the issue would not have ended up in court. " 
And he added: "I have noticed the effect that according to the description given by the father and the mother of Stephanie abuse was on his daughter over the years. 
Clearly she would have been able to have a promising future, successful and happy. "

The director general of the Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers "humiliating" that societies and its members have to pay 
Eventually, the de14 trillion loan should be reimbursed after the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redimidas. 
However, the interests that they become in the interim, pose loaded each year to the 700 financial firms that have deposits. 
The compensation scheme of financial services confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building societies are included in that number. 
It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently... are called upon to pay the price of the institutions that have been far less prudent. 
BSA Adrian Coles, 
That is to say that each of the firms had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and that societies of mediation had to pay approximately 18% of the cost. 
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will 450 thousand pounds in 2009. 
This means that societies have to recover 81 thousand pounds to address the first year of interest. 
Adrian Coles, director general of the Association of Commercial building societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair. 
"It's humiliating to institutions that behaved with caution in the growth of the property market are called upon to pay the price produced by those who were much less prudent." 
According to the BSA, there is no data indicate that the failure of any society since 1945. 
"You will need to examine all aspects of this subject in the coming weeks to see what options exist to protect the building societies and its members in front of what could be a significant price," added Mr Cole. 
The interest accrued in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until the March. 
In 2010, there will be a full year of interests required, which can be almost twice more.

New research in the assumption of American lawyers 
The attorney general of the United States has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine American lawyers in 2006. 
The reason was a report by the inspector general of the Department of Justice criticised the performance by administration officials. 
The report criticised the officials from the White House, lawmakers and former Produrador General Alberto Gonzales. 
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removidos for political reasons. 
The special prosecutor is investigating whether Nora Dannehy officials interrogated during the investigation have lied to investigators in the attempt to obstruct justice. 
"serious allegations of possible criminal behaviour have not been fully investigated and resolved," the attorney general Glenn Fine says in the report. 
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to leave their statements. 
The discussion began when nine American lawyers were removidos their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006. 
At the moment, the department motivated the decision suggesting that lawyers had been fired by underperformers. 
But later they learned that the lawyers had not been assessed worse than other colleagues, and many observers led to the conclusion that the despidas would be motivated by political reasons. 
Some lawyers in question had worked in the pursuit of some high-profile Republicans, members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against the Democrats. 
These lawyers investigating judge and court cases to the government. 
And can be fired at any time, but not removidos for political reasons. 
Now the head of the Department of Justice, the attorney general Alberto Gonzales, under pressure by the layoffs, resigned his position. 
A number of other officials of the Department of Justice did the same. 
The attorney general's report is highly critical of the role played by Mr Gonzales in the matter, and underlines as he had a "primary responsibility" for redundancies, "her abdication of leadership" of his position and was not "significantly" in the collaborative process. 
Other officials, including Karl Rove, the former Bush aide, were criticized for not having cooperated with the investigation. 
The epic of meat loaf of many honors 
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honoured at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out of Hell. 
The singer, who include the special prize next week at the ceremony that will take place in London, said that getting this recognition will be "an honour". 
The song, which lasts nine minutes and 50 seconds, was the title of the album with that Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977. 
The group of Coldplay are leading the nominations for this year's awards and doing the classification of the four categories. 
Paul Rees, redactor-jefe of Q magazine, said: "There are certain songs that transcend time and gender, and bats out of hell is certainly one of them." 
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent voice capacity as that was used for meat loaf. 
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem. 
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and became number 15 in the rankings. 
However, Bat Out of Hell of Meat Loaf stayed around nine years in the rankings and went on to sell more than 40 million copies around the world. 
Meat Loaf - real name is Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical operation for cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert. 
In 2007, a laringitis acute forced him to cancel some concerts.

Dark streets of the city, often forgotten and perhaps prompt the sale 
The City of New York account with thousands of boulevards, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply service. 
However, many people, inclusas taxi drivers veterans and local residents of longstanding, find it difficult to indicate the location of the extra place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street. 
The small Street lies in the East Village and extends to the north of the Primiera Street – before I found the seconda Street, between the Bowery and Second Avenue. 
This little street, more or less than 30 feet wide and 120 long, resembles a polvoriento blind more of an active way. 
There are no signs. 
It is virtually impossible to find in an atlas. 
The Street, however, has admirers. 
For example, there are Avalon Bay, the company which has recently built luxury buildings in the Primiera Street 
It wants extra repavimentar withhold and create a clean corridor to shops and boutiques that is expected to open in the new buildings. 
Other admirers include neighbouring of old data that indicated to be delighted by the truncated Lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the past of the bloc before the appropriation of buildings. 
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it. 
At the meeting of the committee of community of Vencidad for land use that took place this month, representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street. 
However, the committee, preferring the Street remained in the city, called for a new plan, which will be presented next month, said Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the Community N. 3. 
"The city owns today of very few spaces and we would like to follow extra owns withhold," said Mrs 
"We consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street." 
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair small streets and install a few seats, including some to be used as coffee, in the hopes of renting spaces. 
The idea that Avalon could buy the Street emerged for the first time during the meeting this month 
But Michele of Milly, a spokesman of Avalon Bay, said that despite the fact that the company wanted to use the street, not necessarily wanted to possess it. 
"The primary concern of Avalon Bay is the renewal of this blind abandoned and the possibility of converting it into a public area," he said, adding that the proposed sale came from the city itself. 
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Committee for the preservation, confirmed that it was a desire for the city to sell the street and noted that the agency ’ s mission is the development of the property rather than the management of this. 
In comparison with its surroundings of colour, the Bowery, withhold extra has left a mark on history. 
Some believe that got its name in 1802, when the great producer owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between their children and this narrow strip of land was not requested by anyone. 
The back door of the monument of CBGB, the punk rock which closed in 2006, abriba extra in place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that goes on the deck of the album of the Ramones "rocket Russia". 
"The environment was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the managers - the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976. 
"was full of rubbish, pieces of clothing and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, Cords." 
Some residents, including the bloggers to write about the aburguesamiento of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling extra place, arguing that public goods, even modest, must remain open to the public. 
Others have praised withhold extra as rare piece, virtually unchanged Raja, a city that should be recognised. 
Jeremiahs Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's vanishing New York (subtitulo, the Book of Lamentations: bitterly nostalgic look at City in the process of going extinct "), has put at the disposal of a chat in the history of the city on extra withhold newspaper, published by The New Yorker magazine in 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "withhold extra is a blind a little narrow alley, dark and also by the day and scarred by Gates of iron store corroded and contra-ventanas, with old newspapers weeks soplados throughout the canalones." 
With few exceptions, the Street seemed more or less the same on a recent afternoon. 
A rat is curía through the back of the street and near standstill because the door that was used to enter the CBGB and which now hosts a clothing shop luxury. 
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle of nearly 22 - Oz were close to a new batch of discarded newspapers. 
Some interns said that rarely put extra attention in place, but suggested that could give him a cleansed. 
Mr fields, for its part, noticed that some people underestimates the attractiveness of the street in its current state. 
"I spent the best years of my life," said, "in dark places, humid and nasty." 
The debate over bilingualism: immersion in the English language 
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates on bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, an old associated in studies on the California and director of studies of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is Co-Autor of the book "not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs school choice." 
Call effectively to Hispanic voters is a difficult business. 
The proposals in education made by Barack Obama are the example of this. 
The campaign of Mr. Obama notes that "the afro-americanos and students Latins are significantly less likely to be graded white students," and this is a very true. 
To combat such differences in the events of learning, education plan Obama specifically calls, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for the alumnos-Inglés. 
However, the question open for Mr Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers in classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in overrule the gap in the final results. 
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a primary school officially recognized in the eastern region of the County of Los Angeles. 
At this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and family with low incomes. 
More than a third of the students, many of them newcomers, are learning the English language. 
However, an incredible 100 percent of students in the fourth year, has been assessed positively in the examination of mathematics 2008 
And an almost equally astonishing 93 percent has dominated the test of English language and arts. 
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredients that favorido for Mr. Obama. 
School sixth Street emphasizes the review and practice, the constant evaluation of competences and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses. 
Furthermore, and here is where Mr Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal of the Sixth Street, the approach of the school for English instruction to students is in "total immersion." 
Immersion in English means almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the investigation. 
Mrs Mikels, which opposes bilingual education, I said, "we had extraordinary successes with students as the latter has come from Mexico and that, if in the classroom between 12 months later serías not capable of picking up what was". 
"It works," said, "We believe that work." 
Will take Mr Obama as a prep school Sixth Street as a model of replicated by other schools with large populations of pupils hispanos-inglés? 
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of the politicians of his party on the subject of education (associations for national education have been for a long time defenders of bilingual education) and his constant support for bilingual education dark prediction of the response from Mr Obama. 
While it is that immigrants should learn English, recently, Mr Obama has dismissed the question of letting people should stop worrying about the legislation that is written in English 
And instead, he said, "you must make sure your child can speak Spanish." 
If Mr. Obama wants to improve the system and close loopholes, should consider carefully the models of education to work well, more than despise them or trivializarlos. 
The price of oil falls sharply after the renewed fears economic 
The price of oil dropped sharply this Monday because of concern that the American bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to revive the economy. 
Stocks of crude oil fell 7 percent coming to 99.80 dollars a barrel in morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
The price has fallen by more than 20 dollars per barrel since last Monday. 
In the past two weeks, the commodity markets have been buffeted by the financial crisis on Wall Street and by a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. 
After reaching a maximum of 145.29 dollars a barrel in July, oil prices had fallen nearly 90 dollars a barrel at the start of this month, before retreating, once again, because of the huge uncertainty in financial markets. 
The anxiety gripped investors, once again, on Monday, despite the leaders of Congress, who said they had reached an agreement over the weekend about the rescue plan, the largest in history. 
The news was overshadowed by renewed concerns that the financial crisis would be far from complete. 
The development, which came on the last episode of the process of merging, confirms that Citigroup will buy banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, depending on what the government said Monday. 
Meanwhile, the Dutch and Belgian governments, and Luxembourg have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis. 
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, in the frenetic weekend, negotiations that led to the agreement of rescue "do not seem to have been able to revive the feeling of the market." 
As the economic situation deteriorates, is expected in a lower demand for commodities, including oil. 
"The outlook for the global equity, the rate of interest and change will be increasingly uncertain," wrote analysts at Deutsche Bank in a note to investors. 
"We believe that the commodities will not be able to escape from this infection. 
From the perspective of the products, our most pressing concern is evaluating whether the American virus has infected worldwide and specifically China. " 
The bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, as oil consumption low because of the crisis in economic growth forecast and the reduction in the price of oil and gas is a 20 per cent for 2009. 
Second quarter of madness: team record set 
After having gone, during the past eight seasons, longer than anyone in the uniform of jets, playing in defence, Shaun Ellis thought that he had seen everything. 
Then he saw as things develop in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a party without note in a game of deflate. 
"I have never seen anything like this," commented Ellis. 
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played with laziness under the grim the clouds. 
In this moment happened that the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles conducting a target of 12 yardas and suggesting the Harbinger perfect for an afternoon in which the evolution of the relationship between the players took a great leap forward. 
Favre found Coles goals for two more in the fourth, one of these when a cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds left in the half. 
"I ran out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that were to Coles. 
"He is a devil of a player. 
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think. " 
While Favre and Coles were performed at the dam, the defence of the Cardinals maltrataba the quarterback Kurt Warner. 
The cornerback Darrelle Revis interceptó a stone Andante and 32 yardas returned for a touchdown. 
Safety Eric Smith puntó to another pass and interceptó. 
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to lack for Warner. 
In the latest turnover, the failures forced by Bowens, could have been better. 
The Cardenals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kick gave him a 20 yardas final to win a 34-0. 
Are the points higher than the Jets never made in a quarter. 
The team coach, Eric Mangini, preguntad you describe the madness of this moment, said: "the second quarter or the third quarter?" 
When he replied both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter, Mangini said: "I can say that I liked much more the second quarter that the terzero. 
They have won a lot of ground in a very short period of time. " 
Gebrselassie tops his world record rested 
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has shown because many consider him the largest corridor of history, surpassing his own world record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and deviniendo the first person capable of running the race of 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes. 
After the victory in the acomodadiza in plain race in 2: 03: 59, Gebrselassie has shattered by 27 seconds its previous record of 2: 04: 26, obtained last year in Berlin. 
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the world record number 26 in a career of an impressive length so he has set a world championship or a world record for any distance, since the race against time until the marathon. 
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarming, in hindsight, that air pollution agravaran their problems with asthma. 
Instead, he pointed to run in Berlin. 
In almost perfect sunny conditions - and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, employing on average a cortantes 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile. 
Since when runners of Clue as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long distances, the record of the marathon has shrunk by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 2: 06: 05 in 1998. 
After the victory last Sunday, Gebrselassie told reporters who had suffered cramps in the pantorrilla two weeks before and that he had lost a week of training. 
It is obvious that the suspension left him fresh, not corroded. 
"I am very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters. 
"Everything was perfect. 
I began again a week ago, and today teñí some doubts, but in the end all was well. " 
The athlete has been the object of some criticism - especially in Kenya, the rival afro-oriental Ethiopia - for the style of music too their careers, in general, avoiding the meeting with many stars of the world marathon, based on the Pacemaker as if it were a trail of career, and putting the record ahead of the sense of competition. 
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of the skills of Gebrselassie as corridor. 
This Sunday, the March of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie achieved half of the race in 1: 02: 04. 
Two elite runners in Kenya, and James Kwambai Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselassie after his pacemaker decreased. 
But shortly before three miles from the goal, Gebrselassie took a final push to secede from Kwambai, who ended second in 2: 05: 36, improving their best personal record for almost five minutes. 
Kamathi came to third in 2: 07: 48. 
In the women ’ s race, Irina Mikitenko, native Kazakhstan but now German citizen, completed a remarkable year, winning in 2: 19: 19, the seventh fastest time in history. 
Paula Radcliffe of Britain holds the world record of 2: 15: 25. 
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years, was a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2: 24: 14. 
She also took part in the Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set his personal best record in almost five minutes into the third marathon that flowed. 
Made a career of intelligent calculation, leaving a quartet of runners Kenyans and Ethiopians making head, and then regaining them after 18 ½ miles. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won the second place in 2: 21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya was third in 2: 25: 01. 
In a city apart, the pride and the evidence of life of colour 
Outweighed by the expansion of the big theme park in Orlando, a few miles from the brilliant, vocal and colossal city, sits in a quiet village, where the pride and the complications of the African-American experience are very obvious. 
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by blacks embedded in the country and the childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer so simple as she described in 1935: "The city of five lakes, three fields of croquet, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and even a jail." 
Now it is a place of pilgrimage. 
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! fair in Eatonville to pay homage to Mrs Hurston writer, the most famous of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And yet, in many ways, the city that she described – making it also a tourist stage through its inclusion in the travel guide of Florida produced by the Federal Writers of the season of depression -- remains a place apart. 
The city is proud, independent and private as it was in those years, when Mrs ‘30 Hurston wrote that rural blacks in the Florida often resistiva to share their real ideas with the white man, "knows little about us and that he does not know what is going to lose." 
Even now, in the year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to start a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in front of the stranger. 
"We are very cautious about the way in which our history," said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and a member of the oldest church in the city. 
"has to be correct." 
Eatonville since has always been defined a paradox of triumph and fight. 
At the same time there is a historical model of the assertion of blacks and a community of nearly 400 people who live under a level of poverty, double the national average. 
It is a literary center, but also an example repaired of rural culture of black South - sometimes overlooked, other praised - which was born of slavery in America. 
This is not surprising, if those who reside here are at once proud and reserved. 
And the concern about the image of Eatonville really began by Zora, as nobody here called Mrs Hurston. 
She introduced his hometown in the world through their profound books in dialect as "mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes were Watching God" (1937). 
Five paragraphs in the direction of the Florida transformed the city, just outside the Route 17, a road that runs through the centre of the Florida often forgotten inward history of blacks and the human drama. 
Bearing the face of cement in both life terms in literature, Mrs Hurston led to their readers to the shop of ownership of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then in more deprived areas. 
"outside of the road at the left hand," wrote, "there is the modern public school marón finished with its white, their well kept jardinos and backyards of game, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write". 
She also mentions the new husband of the widow dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anyone else goes with transitional rooms." 
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs Hurston puts in Eatonville relationship with the autonomous government, but also with illiteracy, the second marriage and sex. 
Obviously, this Fodor was not. 
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait. 
"Zora described it as it stands out," said she Dinkins, 90 years, one of the girls Johnson that Mrs Hurston inmortalizó quoting men who were singing songs without colour about their beauty. 
He added: "Some people not liked that." 
Mrs Hurston is still remembered here as a excéntrica lively that often returned after his family moved into in Jacksonville, Florida. 
Franklin Augusto, 77 years, recalls that when Mrs Hurston arrived in town, was unannounced in a big Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still prides itself on clothing with dignity. 
The majority of residents remained fascinated, said Mr. Franklin, while many reían sarcásticamente. 
"People are always quite a lot to see Zora," continues Mr. Franklin. 
But, he adds, balanceando in his chair in a backyard with a view of the lake Sabelia, where Mrs Hurston was probably known, "she never stayed too long." 
When Mrs Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and their books were no longer in estampación. 
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten it. 
Although it was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of colour at Barnard College in the years ‘20, was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he had been living. 
In Eatonville, there was no big commemorative ceremonies, or large public readings. 
"I do not believe that their contribution to the world or his legacy were understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "In Rainbows" wrapped, a biography of Mrs Hurston published in 2003. 
A turning point came in the ‘80. 
Officials of the Orange County wanted to put a road five lanes through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the main street of two lanes of the community. 
The expansion of the area of Orlando had already pushed the Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city. 
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history. 
The forced integration, among other things, had put to him relatively idyllic isolation of the community. 
In the ‘50, the struggle for racial mixing led hate about the community. 
"During this season, a group of white boys, were for the city throwing oranges and every thing against people who were sitting on the side," said Mr Franklin. 
"also killed a girl, once. 
He launched against a sandía of the car. " 
In a letter from 1955 to Mrs Hurston wrote to the newspaper the Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court, in Brown v. Board of Education "insultaba instead of honoring my race." 
R residents say today that the desegregation of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the confidence of their young. 
"black children were used to be abrazados - I agree this – is used to embrace professor in the morning and at night," he said. Nathiri N. And, the daughter of her Dinkins and executive director preserves the Eatonville community, a non-profit organization. 
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students not came from the same place. 
"was not embracing your teacher because éra paper - there is a cultural divide there," said Mrs Nathiri. 
Civil rights, however, helped to create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who spent above prejudices, as did she, with buoyant, confidence and lines like: 'How can one deny himself the pleasure of my company! 
I do not understand. " 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker was until the unmarked grave of Mrs Hurston and began to fight to resurrect his reputation. 
Five years later, hailed a biography of Mrs Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroduciéndola in the American royalty. 
The project of the road came just at the point where the most famous daughter of Eatonville was once again under the spotlight. 
And this time, the old neighbours of Mrs Hurston the saw as a savior. 
In 1988, the community began to plan a fairground to Mrs Hurston to show what the county could ruin with this road. 
Thousands of admirers arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and each January, many returning to the celebration. 
After several years, the county has abandoned its proposal of road. 
"The idea resurrected the road to five ways, have been putting in what you might call speed of curvature, a genuine civic pride," said Mrs Nathiri. 
Mrs Boyd said more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville." 
The victory on the road project has helped change the image of the city itself. 
People from outside city as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to the church of here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to revisit the past. 
Eatonville entered into the national historic register in 1998. 
A new library (carrying the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a repavimentado and may Kennedy Boulevard. 
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: only six miles from the center of Orlando, can sometimes feel yourself as a street in the past under a barrage of summer, in a city as small as that was founded by only 27 years black families in 1880. 
(90 percent of the black people is the day.) 
Outsiders who come in search of the history of Eatonville, its meaning, are still often treated with caution. 
A permission beforehand is necessary in order to make the most of the interviews, and some things - as the murals in the church's oldest Eatonville, Pintados by a white man and showing black men who work in the field - cannot be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, as Mrs Jones, a courageous and convinced professor who has a weakness for red brilliant, still feared that their community island da can be misinterpreted. 
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, has also arisen a higher level of hometown pride. 
The young, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs Hurston saw his entire race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also the other racial and ethnic groups in Latin, proud, creative, hardworking, stupid and mixed. 
This is a sincere civic sense what can be heard in the voice of the nephew of Mr Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18 years, which is planned to return to Eatonville after the university to work in the local government or by the Police Department, which said it might need some help. 
And even those who are younger, as a lark and Alexia Kenon, two towers of 11 years of Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly. 
"The majority of people in the case who dare to go this far, they think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared with any other'," says Lark Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday. 
"But if you really stop and Tomas a moment to look at their history, is a very nice city." 
For here, in New York, all talk corrientemente finance 
On the surface, nothing has changed. 
If tourists in Manhattan remained far from kiosks and the giant television screens in Times Square, would not mind finding itself in the eye of the hurricane. 
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the offices to nest of bees that are above their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York faced daily with the worst "bad day at the office" since the slump in 1929. 
Kids for door-to-door delivery undoubtedly continue their trolleys of metal for tea through sidewalks and leading on-board muffins for breakfast meetings. 
Men still dragging between Latins apartment buildings cargodos, like human mules, with 50 shirts of excéntrica estampación colgandas a yoke through their shoulders. The office workers still waiting in line for their food to wear in the morning, and remains impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 by the late in the working days. 
Employees expect Todavia queuing for their bagel the trolleys the sellers Todavia, and it is impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon in Los Dias of the week. 
It seemed as if it were a crisis at all, until this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts that there are, I have decided to open a new account of savings. 
Although he had calculated the time needed for the operation coincided with the calm of the end of the evening in my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, a queue of more or less 20 people was already waiting. 
And not ahead of the window of the employee, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the Bank of customer service where customers of all life talonarios command their cheques, tourists seeking instructions to go to the big stores of Macy and new customers want to open their accounts. 
The majority of these people preceded me, I was told later by Starr, my personal banker "confidence", and were in the queue for the same reason that I. 
Unlike me, still, had already withdrawn their savings of the smaller banks in places from where they had conmutados, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and on Staten Island. 
Had taken their money out of the so-called savings associations (a little like a building society), credit unions and the savings banks from his hometown Brancas whose only function within the state of belonging, and say to treat customers as to his family. 
During the past year, 15 of these banks quietly have failed. 
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion asset, entered bankruptcy, and as New Yorkers travelled towards their homes Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with some savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer of rescue. 
Workers from the offices and shops that fell in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money into a bank to what is considered a safe haven, what he is doing most of the rescue on Wall Street. 
Ordinary people in New York have become in recent weeks in experts in finance. 
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking by telephone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank failed, and its executive director of aspect, Dick Fuld struck, commented on the issue with familiarity as if it quejaran the inactivity of a colleague. 
And Lyn, 50th and something conserje uniform on my block of flats, has changed the course of our discussions on Brad and Angelina, or my purchases at the shopkeeper. 
He said to me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in money market funds. 
The reprieve is made, I am not taking some risk. " 
Muslim graves, at the moment in which Austria is close to the right 
Heinz-Christian Strache, the left wing of the right-wing Party for Freedom of Austria and Belgian Filip Dewinter, affiliated to the party of far-right Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present to the organization "cities against the Islamisation" in Antwerp, on Thursday, 17 January 2008. 
Carry traffic signals that represent the mosques with a red line that crosses. 
The police is blaming a far-right extremists by have desecrated a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that political parties of the extreme right made huge profits in the general election in the country. 
More than 90 were severely damaged graves in the cemetery of Traun, near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action. 
Criminals doused Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David on some of the graves, but researchers think that this may have happened by the attempt to conceal the real reasons for extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants. 
It is not clear whether the incident was in some way connected with the elections. 
A spokesman for the local Muslim community said they were "deeply chocados" by the news of the desecration, who came to the religious Muslims when the Ramadan month was ending. 
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing a round of introspection after the shift to the right in the parliamentary elections yesterday. 
The two far-right parties that are acapararon almost 30% of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign encentrada in anti-inmigración vehemence and some of its slogan xenophobic were considered by critics. 
Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the Freedom Party, which won more than 18% of the vote, made his campaign against those of head scarves and burkas, and moreover, expressed its opposition to food considered associated with Islam. 
At its last meeting in Vienna, spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam. 
Both parties ententan to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the policy of ongoing Islamicisation in Austria and Europe. 
Polls and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far-right bloc as the most powerful politician in the country, indicate that the change was mainly by those young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.

A source in the Ministry of Home Affairs once that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary was calmed and was glad to know that Glitter had forbidden to travel to France and Spain. 
"I understand the master outside the scene to extract its nature" Günter Bauer < - > photographer 
Neither heels or transporting or suits debut. 
The essence of the great masters of the Flemish, stripped of the concentration in the interpretation to obtain the relaxed aspect of the man or woman. 
One side the artist. 
On the other, the person. 
Inseparable except in privacy, in these times, when strangers to the public find privacy in a gesture, the depth of a stolen or expresividad gaze of a few hands, despreocupadas because they are not going to get to the scene. 
The German Günter Bauer alternate in "Flamenco-people" teatralidad some eyes on stage with singers, dancers and guitarristas with this side less known of these teachers. 
With this proposal, the photographer collects the iconography of the particular Fleming from different areas. 
Included in the programming of the month of the Flemish photograph, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of the Flemish, more every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" may be people anyone, but to see the photos, the Observer realizes that it is not the typical images of artists in the scene. 
This people portrayed "on the street" artists are able to convey in scene passion, sadness, joy... cautivando to the public. 
To capture the personality of these artists must not take photos of the scene. 
Take his personality and character inside. 
What I wanted was to create an intimate atmosphere that enables me to get to the House the personality of the great of the Flemish ". 
With the taste of the Eurovision song "of mines," Bauer 1.997 began in a long journey to portray the cantaores, guitarristas or bailaores house with a plaque. 
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the House and the material recall the classic photograph. 
The implementation of different media estilísticos breaking with the traditional base of the image, giving him modernity, idea that reflects how understands the Flemish Bauer himself: "a very traditional music with roots that evolves and surprising every day." 
It is not the action of the dance, sing or touch in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that cautiva with their art to the public. 
The search for a meeting with the essential Duende, which becomes visible in a way of being, and be are and have been the constant this work that is presented these days in the Fotómata gallery. 
Known figures of the Flemish as Diego the lobster, Chano Lobato, Cristina holes, Enrique Moren yourself, Lebrijano, Antonio channels, Vicente friend, among others, are this selection of almost seventy photographed artists. 
The project has become an anthology of the Flemish, soon to be published in a book on the portraits exposed in the sample. 
The passion for the portraits of Bauer took him to repeat the idea two years ago with "portraits of sportsmen veterans" ("SportARTproject"). 
Although the concepts are different in Flamenco-people "," the photographer admits that "I love portray people, know them and to enter a moment in his life, is an instant long or short. 
I believe that within the photograph the portrait is gender more difficult. 
You are or enfrentas with people, characters, sometimes not know, or that you leave only a few minutes to take the photo. 
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make reality my ideas. " 
This collection of portraits of the current Flemish entitled "Flamenco-people" in the gallery showcases the Fotómata, located in the number 20 of the streets of the Kills, parallel to the promenade of Hercules, where can visit themselves until the next 16 October.

The Latin American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way of measuring whether" and books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that this "has effects" and "makes people more inconforme", so we asked the writers "not abandon the frivolity" and "take responsibility" in their vocation.

Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of EU to assume their responsibilities in the case Silva 
The general coordinator of EU and Member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, secured today will be the regional federation of training which will take a decision on the case of the former councillor of youth and sports in the city of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of making deals in favour of relatives.

Nevertheless, the leader of EU defended the need for "transparency" is present in the investigations into possible irregularities that Silva could have committed: "EU has always argued that such matters have the maximum degree of transparency".

"Blood" may, the gamble of Garci epic 
Drawing on the national episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci lifts the celebrated Spanish uprising against the French in blood may, which is the film more ambitious in its filmografía with nearly 15 million budget. 
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" which has always admired in the work of the renowned novelist, has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the forefront of a broad list of performers. 
Blood may, with a metraje superior to the two and a half hours, this Friday resolute presence in the cinema halls, to become the future in a miniserie Telemadrid for more than four hours' duration. 
A great fan of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci ensures have met this represented "a dream of childhood", which must thank hope Aguirre, who since the Community of Madrid charged three years ago a tape rolled memorial for the 200th anniversary of the May 2 Madrid, something that always accepted and when the story was based on national episodes. 
The 15 million budget that has brought in its entirety the Community of Madrid to Garci constitute a "unique opportunity" ambientar decorated with the appropriate costumes and the portrait of a "atolondrada Spain which was wrong head to fight for, because the fight for independence led people to enormous delay with the reign of Ferdinand VII," pointed out. 
But the filmmaker regrets not having had a financing as Alatriste or the ghosts of Goya - more than double the blood may - which has not been able to break some scenes plastered on a script signed alongside Horace Valcárcel, with whom he has cooperated in almost his entire career. 
Therefore, the director of bouncing back, has emphasised that is his usual way of working, in setting the scene with the players, with those who usually test before starting to adjust and which does not seem, by casting him "humiliating" and consider that "part of the job of the director lies in going to the theatre and cinema to know what is happening in the industry in which works." 
Many of the performers with which coincides in blood may repeat before his house, as is the case of Michael Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Crow. 
The Oscar nominee on four occasions - of which won a - Garci believes that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year in Hollywood, the Academy of one's own blood may, seven French ping pong tables and finally selected, Los Girasoles blind, does not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "that is to be known," he assured. 
With this film Garci not expected prizes. 
"In the beginning you believe that trabajas for posterity, then you realise that only trabajas for prosperity, and now you conformas with making a film more," explains Garci after more than 30 years of career. 
Elizabeth Bayón recovered the essence of the dancer Sevillana Tórtola Valencia 
A bailaora Sevillana going to pay homage to a dancer also Sevillana. 
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and mother Andalusia (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the District of Triana, and when she was three years moved into London with his family. 
It was a dancer of free dance and specialist in oriental dances. 
Had an exciting life, a pioneer of the liberation of the woman, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
It was a Buddhist and vegetarian and called for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women. 
The life of this woman who marked a revolution dancística and aesthetics in Europe between the wars, fascinó to Elizabeth Bayón. 
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character and it seemed unbelievable". 
According to the bailaora, "We do not intend to tell his life but collect their spirit. 
The titles of his dances I have suggested sticks of the Flemish. 
Well, "the dance of Butterfly," I suggested a Guajira, or "The Dance" a snake tangos. 
Their dance was sensuous and I have told me that my dance is also within this aesthetic, "says. 
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: Miguel Poveda that cantará again to Elizabeth in one in their spectacles, as it did in the case of "the open door"; and with the teacher Matilde coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with anyone outside his student. 
"Matilde makes Tórtola greater, the character of maturity. 
I am happy because it has accepted act in my work and I am very honoured by this. " 
The Assembly also account with music composition and guitarras of Jesus towers and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi of Morón; the Pistons the bird, as well as Rafa violates the viola and collaboration of a player, Juanfra Juárez, "which makes the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were divas throughout its length, and who always love them." 
The labor board also somehow the life of this woman who developed in places as far-flung, especially for the era, such as India, the United States or Russia, apart from across Europe, which usually already living in London. 
"I wanted to remember it because I think that it is these women who have a huge influence in a particular time and nobody knows and much less puts the value in his work," says Bayón. 
The spectacle will start today at the 20.30 hours in the theatre Lope de Vega. 
The publication of the "day of a poet newly married" closes the three 
The presentation of the first edition of the journal illustrated "of a poet Reciencasado" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez incurred marriage with Zenobia in March 1916, falls within the planned activities by the Department of Culture of the regional government of Andalusia to celebrate the "three Zenobia and Juan Ramón 2006-2008" (), organised with the subject to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for literature and the death of both. 
In this way, "three Zenobia and Juan Ramón" reaches its end with the republication of this work, with the International Congress, which was held in New York, with the restoration of the House of the Nobel Museum and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: the Chopo of light", which was inaugurated last May and, after travelling by the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected will be travelling to New York during the course of the international conference.

America is like less without Paul Newman 
"Sometimes God creates people perfect. 
Paul Newman was one of them. " 
The phrase is the actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absence of Malice," and gives the idea of the distress of American cinema, and across America, before the striking idea that Newman has been. 
Mira that cost them give him an Oscar. 
And that was withdrawn from 2007. 
And who knew that he was very ill. 
Yet it has been a blow to everyone. 
"Sometimes what you feel is beyond any expression, and I now have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to its existence". 
Nobody was afraid of doing the ridiculous or exaggerate. 
A father had died of cinema and homeland in a particularly dark moment, with fear of terrorists and markets, with the American self-esteem by soils, desperately seeking grounds for dignity. 
So hard when is the time and without virtue men and very few beings who admire you are, need not be Luis Cernuda love for Paul Newman. 
For almost all embodied a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth. 
Richard Nixon was formal enemy and defender of lost causes and won, from the Foundation to combat drugs created in honor of his primogénito died from overdoses until their brand of organic and homemade food. 
All a gift to a country that has cost him much overcome a suicidal food culture. 
The expansive wavelength of admiration barría Hollywood regardless of nationalities or passports. 
The latest James Bond, Daniel Craig, English concluded that has not died a man but an era. 
Another English, the oscarizado director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was neither more nor less than the summit of his career. 
The bad boy come from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration. 
"We have left the bar very high at all," concluded George Clooney, perhaps one of the few that nowadays dares to try to live as experienced Paul Newman: maintaining high demands of probity and private life have a serious and remote cameras. 
This is not always easy or even possible in the media jungle today. 
But there are those who tries, and Paul Newman is his example. 
It divorció once but then was married fifty years with Joanne Woodward, who was certainly true when too many opportunities for him not to be so. 
"But what I am going to eat hamburger outside of home, whether inside my steak?", used to play himself. 
In the sky has the pride that the land their daughters coincide with their called anoraks, something not so common in America. 
"Of all the major papers that he interpreted, none was as proud as the devout husband, father, grandfather caring lover and philanthropist dedicated," they say. 
The career of an Olympic Madrid imperfect 
Yes, the dream of many of us, is being held in Madrid a few souvenirs and, after the failed 2012, that may be the 2016. 
But I wonder, are we ready? 
If we follow the example of the race yesterday, I say no! 
The perfect race called the, and in my view has been the worst career with much that I state. 
A height of absurdities that, since then, if you take into account as evaluation and I look into abeyance, would be a very clear. 
But go for parties and from the outset. 
The outrages begins with the collection of the ganglion, you just have to go before. 
This does not seem to me to be wrong, but if you do go to give everything (including the chip to avoid queues in the race). 
Because not. 
Here you were only going to collect the ganglion (first inanity, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, only had stature "s" for the Jersey (second inanity, because I need a size XL) 
In what world we live? 
Or is that by the crisis have decided to buy only small T-shirts with less cobwebs and cheaper? 
Well, things like these are minor compared with the day of the race. 
Apart from that have to go very soon to collect the chip, the queue to get is 15 minutes and, furthermore, we must make the rucksack. 
More than 35 minutes lasted waiting, incomprehensible for a race where it is expected to more than 11,000 people. 
Then, as expected, began the race and we still had not left the rucksack, although once achieved, the collection was worse. 
Moreover, the rain amenizó waiting for more than 40 minutes, coupled with that of popular rebellion and assault on the booth. 
I believe that some 500 people have pulmonía probably tomorrow, and some like myself, even appearing with the right time in the rankings, owing to the chip that gave me that, I imagine, I am not marked out correctly. 
Since then, if I ask for the perfect race, this wouldn't join my thoughts. 
So I believe that we will continue to dream with an Olympic city well prepared. 
Microsoft seeks virtual (Receptionist) 
In the conference of emerging technologies mit Microsoft has shown an advance of a new system of recognition of image and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence without a lot of intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move on the campus of the company) looking at what they heard in the conversation. 
Thanks to a house and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people in the room, who they are - even remember what have since - and listen and understand the key words of their talks. 
Also grouped according to the present groups of conversation. 
The video shows the receptionist detects a third person but understands that does not belong to the group which is talking with her, and that is not an employee of the company. 
I question whether it is there to visit someone and he says that he will heed shortly. 
All without pantallazo blue. 
Impressive. 
But that, of course, is the future. 
Now the company has better things to concentrate, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows. 
This week has spoken very above a change of strategy in Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many related programmes. 
Steve Ballmer, has discovered that if computers bundled with the imperative instead of decomposing basurilla would trade, five times faster - man, Steve, because it will be for less. 
An entire discovery bearing in mind that Microsoft, version following version, has added functions and "extras" windows. 
The change of course is appreciated. 
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing weight, and also the software. 
When Google Chrome went to the network, was one of those who joined the theory that this was the first step in Google to compete with Windows. 
Many rightly pointed out that a Navigator is not an operating system. 
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the imperative for the hardware and software they understand. 
Serves the same function that his wife or her husband when you have to say something to his mother-in-law. 
Is true. 
Never will disappear but think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative. 
What Ballmer has said this week is the confirmation of this idea. 
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system, and more to the Web browser. 
The computer was cranked up only to execute the Firefox or Explorer - or chrome - and every day we spend more time sailing in the environment of Windows. 
Why serve half of the applications that come in the system? 
Less is more. 
Windows 7 and has to be less, much less, that view. 
Less cumbersome, less stretched, less complex. 
Microsoft cares more integrating its services online, and finally to be an alternative to Google. 
We desperately need, in fact, and I have a small example. 
The photograph of this post the took in one of the rooms of rest for employees of Microsoft in Redmond, at the beginning of the month. 
In the machine of soft drinks a poster asked to use its search tool, "your search. Our future". 
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees of Microsoft used Google to search the Web. 
Last week, incidentally, also confirmed a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
Will not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, rather in 2010. 
In Microsoft will probably set the launch of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7. 
The phone is, after all, is more computer every day. 
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already in the street, going to pass bills. 
Le Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso was on the Cote d'Azur, Leonardo Di Caprio Lucia A in "Blood Diamond" of Edward Zwick, the same as Al Pacino in "The Godfather" of Francis Ford Coppola and form part of the uniform of the gay musculada parish. 
And if we put to enumerate appearances points, we can go back to the image of the forzudo of Bigote puntiagudo that lifted weights in a travelling circus. 
In essence, it is more than the typical male Jersey home in cotton caste-bound, and without sleeves. 
'Tank', which call the Anglos speakers, but Le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles express above all others. 
First, by his bombast name - although it is them familiarly known as "Marcel" -- which has to do with the sport because it gets its name, according to the legend, Marcel Cerdan does, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf. 
"The Marcel" highlights on the other for his excellent cotton, for his court unisex, for their distinctive shield and the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that models of most emblematic Jersey lead as detail in the neck. 
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focuses on their tank tops. 
Also includes sudaderas College, means of cashmere cardigans, boxers, cotton trousers, shirts emphasize, babies, Mini shorts... 
Clothing designed for comfort underwear. 
Although it is a pity to them as underwear. 
Have too charm.

Actress and dancer, diseñadora, you are a woman very multi-faceted, why not? 
I believe that, yes, but in the end, it all together and have many ties in common. 
To me from small I loved the clothes; he wanted to go home to my grandmother to dip into the cupboards of my aunt and see their clothes. 
Was the bomb, almost better than going to the theme park. 
Then, dancer, always was caring how I vestía. 
You know that the dancers we like a lot to ask our estilismos classes and trials, to look in the mirror and feel well. 
And in the role of actress when you give the costumes when it are really the character.

Then, together in being mother or not? 
Since then, I know that I am going to be mother because I asked the body and, moreover, to be young mother; that I do not want to lose him. 
With regard to the candidate, not worry. 
What I will do is give them a lot of happiness to my son and educate them with much love. 
With regard to the cinema, you are pending several opening nights that rodaste last year.

Good, good, not saying that. 
It is not that I subiese a footbridge to make model.

Drivers will have to install the hardened by alcohol " 
Alcolock'Interior wants the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcohol, have to install in your vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle clawing drunk, or if not windy. 
The initiative was already announced last June and now appears to be included in the annual memory of the prosecutor general of the state, according to which it is a pilot project that will last a year. 
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver, so that this will also receive a course of re-education Road. 
Experience, in addition to the general Fiscalia Segurida Road will include the Directorate-General of traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute Foundation for the safety of the car (FITSA). 
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists who more than once by lead ebrios returns to pick up the car. 
The alcolock avoid it because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measured the rate of alcohol in air and prevents espirado rip the car driver if the wind does not blow abtes; or when it detects a concentration of alcohol is superior to the permitted. 
The cost is superior to the 1,000 euros and ran on account of the sanctioned. 
In this sense, a study carried out in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles fitted with these devices to reduce infringements in 65% during the first year of implementation. 
And in Spain it is estimated that could save the lives of 115 people each year. 
The measure sticks to administrative penalties for two reasons: to address these behaviour before they escalate into criminal offences. 
And facilitate its implementation, as the legal reform can be done by ordinary way, however, the necessary reform by the criminal law requires a reform in an organic law. 
The device is not yet available in the Spanish market in any form of trade, although has already been introduced on an experimental vehicles in some industrial and public service. 
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies vote tomorrow, an initiative of the PSOE in which intends to install on school buses this system, as has been done in France.

O là là, c'est la vie. 
The number antiestrés 1001, 
There are 1,000 but 1,000 more a case of forgetting the chaotic and frenzied daily life. 
And if that were not enough, all are assembled in a book bringing leisure at bookstores on 30 September. 
The alarm sounds almost punished when every morning at 7 o'clock in the morning, but even worse imagine trapped in the hectic pace that imposes life today. 
The office is called tension and the computer back pain. 
Stress is the evil of the 21st century. 
But there is one or two methods to combat the exhaustion day and the problems of disconnect with the workplace. 
No, the number is, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001. 
On the sidelines of the positions of the classic or yoga, massage treatments, "spa" Susannah Marriott meeting in the pages of a book around a "menu" of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each. 
The work antiestrés called "1001 ways to relax" and his calm will bookshops of Pearson and DK Publishing the Alhambra. 
If someone believes that it is not possible to achieve calm in areas like work or through personal relations, this "manual" belies this belief. 
Moreover, offers other procedures as being in touch with nature or recipes 100% natural that contribute to the relaxation. 
If the adrenalin no longer runs through your veins to restore the balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the sofa, shut down the mind and focus on reading. 
Their sleep talk 
Some children speak for the night. 
I am not talking about those who wakes up very espabilados telling us something that has happened the previous day, but children who speak still asleep. 
The first time it happens to the best you take a fright, but in reality it is not important. 
It is a benign altering the dream that is called somniloquios. 
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents. 
Sure that most of you have had that spoke at night. 
This phenomenon can appear quite sporadic (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more regularly (every day, once a week, once in months...), the next day the boy does not remember anything. 
There is no one single cause that determine its appearance. 
They are often linked to other disturbances of the dream as usually the nightmares, the night terrors, the night enuresis (be sleeping PiS) or the sonambulismo, but does not necessarily be the case. 
As we mentioned earlier may also be associated with paintings of very high fever, to situations of stress or sobreexcitación. 
Nevertheless, it is a phenomenon little studied. 
The intensity with which appears is also very variable. 
It may be that speaks in a tone of voice and calm words loose, a murmur or the opposite (cries, llantos, long speeches …). 
In cases where the demonstration is very intense be observing the child and consult with a specialist, to see if there is any question that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives out this way. 
We have said that it is a benign altering, therefore has no treatment, except that is linked to another alteration of the dream that we can treat (if, for example, is associated with sleep apnea or a picture of stress). 
What we can do is take into account a range of very simple preventive measures, such as: 
Try not to excite much the child before they go to sleep. 
Therefore seek games reassured and avoid programmes or television series that they fear or a little violent. 
With children very nervous and that they find it hard to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them to acquire a certain domestic calm. 
This will be that the child can have a dream more quiet. 
Once the somniloquias try to keep calm. 
'remember that are harmless to the child, and that the next day not remember nothing of what has happened. 
Councils useful, 
Not despertéis. 
It is useless, because he is not aware, and I romperéis the dream. 
Although he is talking, he is sleeping and therefore is descansando. 
'remember that if it shows very prey for several episodes should consult or find out what generates much anxiety in the child. 
If you understand what he says (which is not the more usual), not caigáis in the temptation to make him an interrogation to coax information. 
Not conseguiréis nothing, because to be sleeping is not aware as to organize their thinking. 
In addition you oiréis what he says, but they do not know what is dreaming to say that, with this very careful in how interpretáis information and with the conclusions that sacáis. 
He never them to the child that you can interrogate night to know their secrets. 
Even joke. 
This generates a lot of anxiety. 
In short, don't worry, there is nothing wrong, is an episode that lasts only a few minutes. 
Don Illhaeusern Finally! 
Football Club, Illhaeusern, finally found the road to victory in his field after a long period of scarcity. 
Without having done a good party, the team created many occasions of goal and was able to make a goal to win the game. 
The pace was not very steady during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty to express themselves. 
After a first attempt to captain Kauffmann that rozaba the squadron with a shot from afar, near Illhaeusern would take the "power" and turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn Romain above, with the tip of the foot or prevent Diebold also came to the defense of Dannemarie. 
In front, not leave the centrocampista pass and just leave Riahi in a position to attack. 
The principle of the second time was crucial, first with two occasions of goal of Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the scoreboard for the Illhousiens with the goal of Marais, well placed to collect the ball rejected in a first attempt to Diebold (53 "). 
But the goleador Illhousiens cannot savour long their happiness and will be forced to return in the guardarropas a dozen minutes later and leave their fellow team in numerical inferiority. 
But Dannemarie did not seize the opportunity and will not be a problem for the eleven Illhousiens that fell slightly to "shrinking" their defence, except in the last seconds of game during which, after a major farfulla, the ball went very near the field transverse.

The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Sábato gives five points of advantage for Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), judging that is the Democrat who went well. 
Among the undecided voters, which are those that count, Obama went winner with 39% of respondents, while 25% of them concede victory to McCain, according to a new CBS poll. 
Obama could confirm his advantage Thursday with good provision expected of its member of his own candidacy, Joseph Biden, for the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin. 
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it. 
It has good instincts, "warned however Bill Clinton this weekend. 
The septuagenario McCain evidenced by their undisputed experience in foreign policy, highlighting the "naïve" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first confrontation.

"In Minsk," Do you have noted elections in Minsk? " 
Young and opponents demonstrated last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarussian capital in advance to reject the results of the legislation. 
Some hundreds of Belarussians met Sunday afternoon from the closure of the polling stations in the central square in Minsk to protest against the flawed nature of the legislation. 
While no results had been announced yet, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of the President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, must resign." 
Some recognize not having voted: "Why, because that will do what they want with my vote," said a young. 
Do not believe that the regime that put a good face on foreign observers with the aim of renewing contact with the European Union is ready to make a democratic change. 
Sanctions, among whom l'interdiction of 40 visas for Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be filed if these elections are considered fair for the observers. 
They were not according to the opposition. 
"We have been placed at the side of electoral commissions and our observers could not participate in the counting of the votes," mourned Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman of the Union of democratic forces, a regrouping heterogeneous twelve parties. 
"It is a cosmetic change, highlights Alexander Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate for the presidential election in 2006 and leader of the pro-European movement, because what matters is who counts the votes, and in our house, is the executive power. 
If some members of the opposition enter parliament, it is because they have been nominated, but not chosen. 
"But its entry to Parliament may mean appearances on television, meetings in regions and proposals of law." 
The opposition must therefore to enter the political game because "there are to begin a dialogue with the European Union. 
Because if our economy, which has many debts front of Russia, is in crisis, and if we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia. 
But we want to be independent. " 
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process does not recognise the validity of the vote. 
It stresses that turnout figures seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) favored manipulation. 
"Do you have noted the elections? Asked about the Social Democrat leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of two recent political prisoners released in August of this year. 
There was no one in the polling stations. 
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, the better suit to power. " 
The silence of the night back again in October Square. 
On television, the President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission are happy for his success. 
The interview - blood returns to be sure 
Héma-Québec yesterday 10° celebrated its anniversary of its founding, and its president, Francine Décary, had reason to be pleased, because Héma-Québec has returned to being one of the suppliers more safe and effective of blood in the world. 
And, above all, reconquered it public confidence that had been vacilada seriously by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s. 
As you know, reserves administered by the National Blood Transfusion Service of the Canadian Red Cross have been contaminated by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the virus for hepatitis C during the 1980s. 
In the face of this tragedy, and the anger of the public, the government of Canada made in February 1994 a public inquiry, chaired by the judge Horace Krever, who sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to this tragedy and formulate recommendations for such a disaster is not reproduce more. 
While the judge Krever well in presenting their relationship, certain provinces then created a committee that had intended to plan a new management system of blood in Canada. 
In Quebec, the Committee Gélineau performed this mission. 
As a result of the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: to provide Héma-Québec Quebec and Canadian society of blood to supply all the other provinces and both territories. 
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began their activities, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the system of blood in Quebec, recalls Décary. 
The situation was grim. 
After having done many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and much work during the years that followed, have regained the confidence of the public, "says before proudly claim that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the population quebequesa had confidence in Héma-Québec henceforth. 
Dr Décary recalls however that "the confidence is something extremely fragile." 
Since its inception, the 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec applied the precautionary principle. 
At that time, asistíamos in Europe at the birth of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Décary account. 
And did not know whether the disease could be transmitted by blood. 
Then we are on one of the main recommendations of the reports and Gélineau Krever, whereby when we do not know and when a serious illness can emanate from that, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, implementing measures of exclusion. 
In April 1999, then refuse the blood of people who had remained more than a month in the UK since 1980. 
But, a few years ago, it has been proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood. 
This episode showed us so that the precautionary principle be applied had the sense. " 
In 1999, appeared on the market a technique much more sensitive in detecting HIV: tests to detect directly nucleído acid in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not antibodies against the virus, which governed the evidence used until now. 
The acid test nucleído allowed to shorten the period between the moment in which the person has been infected and the time when the first virus can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist. 
We were able to reduce this period in a period of less than a week. 
So substantially diminish the risk that certain donors are infected unknowingly and not be able to detect them. 
These improvements enabled considerably reduce the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion. 
Today, one person every 12 million runs the risk of receiving blood contaminated with HIV. 
"This means that there will be to distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected by HIV. 
As well as Héma-Québec distributed each year between 400 and 500 000 000 blood products, it will take more than 24 years before to be followed by a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product. 
I believe that we can today receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to regain health without concerns, "says the head of the direction of Héma-Québec. 
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products. 
You never know which pathogen could emerge in the system. 
Last year appeared in the island of Réunion the chikungunya virus that, following the example of the West Nile virus, which is transmitted by an insect in the blood. 
We must be constantly vigilant, "pursues the doctor Décary before emphasize that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also forecast a sufficient supply. 
"The needs increase because the population is aging. 
Since the anti cancer treatments more aggressive, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or plaquetas. 
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors that embraces on average only 3% of eligible Quebequeses the donation of blood. " 
All people with good health, 18 years and that correspond to the admissibility criteria can however donate blood every 56 days, or is six times a year. 
On average, 14% of people who proposes his blood are not accepted, because suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if travelled in a country where Queen malaria, be excluded for a period of one year. 
"With this 3%, we managed to keep a scorecard that cover the needs of hospitals. 
The hardships are very rare. 
But we must renew Members of this network of donors as they get older and cannot more donate their blood. 
But it is difficult to convince people donate blood, but above all, detain them and encourage them to be regular donor. 
Since the current life is very rarely rampant, find time to spend an hour to donate their blood ", Francine Décary burden. 
With a budget of $297 million annually, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including óseos grafting, heart valvas balloons, eye and skin that is almost exclusively used for the great burnt. 
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public bank umbilical cord blood in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord that formerly was seen as biomedical waste is full of a rich blood stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia. 
"We have held a few weeks ago, the Bank of our thousandth shows umbilical cord blood and is expected to draw more than one thousand of these per year. 
We should begin to propose it for grafting at the beginning of next year, "precise Décary doctor who describes this program of decision-making cord blood as a very popular. 
"; many are disappointed not to be able to enjoy this," since Héma-Québec has no resources to propose this program complex and costly in every hospital in Quebec.

Northern Charest deals 
The prime minister does not preclude in March elections before the end of the year. 
As soon as the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, in Quebec, where the new minister of health, Yves Bolduc (left), trying to make themselves choose during the by-election today. 
Rejecting the limits of our last great northern border ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force flailing in the headings, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday. 
Behind him, during his speech, were projected images. 
Desfilaban, in three huge screens, dramatic images of hydroelectric dams, Quebec mining, seen by previous MGPs "," Google maps, etc. 
Big media as during the election period. 
The Prime Minister thinks that the elections will be held this autumn, although did see that his schedule was very full. 
The "flat North" is the fourth side of a "vision" that the Prime Minister intends to have to Quebec, a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on the workforce with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario. 
Often mentioned in the speeches of prime minister recently, the opening up of the North - the northern territory at the 49° parallel - never had been the subject of a presentation. 
The prime minister was nevertheless explain why the North was "a jewel in the huge potential," but did not an end, amounts of investment, or precise priority in future projects. 
What could be more developed are above all: particularly the hydro-electricity, the forest, but above all the mining sector, dopado by the growth of emerging countries and rebuilding public infrastructure. 
"The North contains nickel, zinc, copper, gold, silver, platinum, iron, titanium and Diamond," according to the list of Mr. Charest. 
This "territory twice as big as France," "is our home, is in Quebec. 
Not only is our home, but that is on us, "he insisted, as to show requesting a myth national founder. 
Quebec is built much thanks to its relationship with the North, stressed: the flood into gold in Abitibi, engineering quebequesa, James Bay. 
"We Belong, is our future," he added, having made a theatrical pause to contemplate the map vast behind him. 
The North, 70% of the territory quebequés, comprises a part of the Labrador that Quebec always proclaimed specified, Prime Minister during the press conference. 
"It is a traditional position that all governments reiterated. 
There is a line of border in which they agree not long ago, and when the opportunity presents itself, to reiterate the position of part of the government, "indicated. 
Moreover, "with the climate changes, we must rethink our vision of the North," said talking about the passage of the Northwest, which will be open every year due to ice smelters. 
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupy the territory is a duty. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, the first nations and the Inuites? 
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit, particularly young people. 
Two former ministers who come from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former member of the party quebequés of Ungava), already begun consultations about a 30 communities. 
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (transport and natural resources) has an important role began some jobs. 
The prime minister does not preclude an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a meeting in which "will be a common vision." 
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. 
The North "will be struck, orderly and respectful of the environment," he promised. 
Jean Charest described this as a "vision" that is in continuity with the prime ministers liberals who preceded him. 
"As liberals who preceded us, we thought of another way to transform the challenges in new opportunities for growth and development." 
This was one of the recurring themes of weekend, which began Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50° anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage to the power of the party. 
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout dam. 
"Godbout, which created HydroQuebec Lesage, who made the quiet revolution and the nationalisation of hydro-electricity, which made the Bay Bourassa James our party knew shaping the future," said John Charest. 
At the press conference, vowing another reference, this conservative, the programme "roads to the North" John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963. 
Coming to the subject of the hydroelectric dam project of Eastmain1a - Ruper, Mr. Charest stressed that his start-up is scheduled for 2012. 
"This is among us, but expect to be there," entrusted to its militants, provoking applause. 
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that would have no place in 2008 elections and certainly not in 2009, not ruled out the possibility of launching a vote this autumn, what the law allows. 
It stresses that his schedule is nevertheless full, particularly because of a mission of the Federation Council in China and a summit Quebec-Nueva York York. 
The General Council of weekend abasteció liberal leader a platform that contained resolutions nationalists, particularly "constitutional aspirations" had no problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of the Quebec calls in particular for the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution. 
Quebec also wants to appoint members of the Council of the Canadian broadcasting and telecommunications and that they have a right of veto over decisions made in Quebec. 
On the side of the opposition, greeted the broad outlines of the plan North with skepticism. 
The head of the party quebequés, Pauline Marois, did underline the development policy of northern Quebec government Landry had launched in 2001. 
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, resigned to implement it. 
If we had done that, "would progress today," said Mrs Marois alongside their candidate on Jean-Talon (vote), Françoise Mercure made today. 
The Democratic Action of the Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a plan north of part of the government. 
"But what you want, is that this is not just a spectacle," commented the leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from holiday today. 
Letters - a country defiled 
It is Mr. Vic Toews, the former minister of "justice" (oh, irony!) in the cabinet Harper, who allowed last summer say that Luisa Arbour was a "disgrace" to Canada. 
Dishonouring this woman who led a relentless fight for justice and that deserves all our admiration what it says everything about relationships and Prime Minister Stephen Harper. 
We are in front of a government that is unique among all Western countries involved, which has not returned to their national who is locked in a concentration camp in Guantánamo. 
It is a government that takes no account of any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager very young when the facts that are recriminados occurred. 
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and leaves living in inhuman conditions a child soldier. 
The only chonta with a false justice to assess the guilt of the accused. 
Remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers, particularly, argue the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order that enjoys the benefit of a fair process in Canada. 
Is this government that closes its eyes on torture: little care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, doubtless forever after so many years of violence. 
Yet we do not realise this, but we are witnessing at the moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continued to repeat and that makes no sense. 
Now the time has come for which there is no moral more: we maltreatment, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen and wants the head of government until now a minority (what will happen after 14 octubre ?). 
Many voters believe that find salvation in a party that is advocating virtue, law and order: do not see that this government resigned to what was the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
Mr. Toews shame is caused by this resignation and nothing more. 
Free opinion - the Orwellian speech of Barrick Gold 
In its edition of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of the Canadian Barrick Gold mining. 
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold asserts that the company in the world's largest aurífera tried a process for defamation of six million euros against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a public discussion "transparent". 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that judge, especially in the case of persecution for defamation, but the law. 
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver. 
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate could damage whoever dares to sustain a position contrary to yours? 
The outcome of the lawsuit has little importance, the authors and the editor of the book noir Canada must spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers sustained by the pockets almost without substance of the mining. 
The tactic, in these fights unequal, is often consists in ruin to defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that amordazará opposition in addition to scare whoever dare to look again at the issue. 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, is in front of the public that would have had to submit their vision of the facts. 
Contrary to what is being done in several countries where works Barrick Gold, debates in Canada are normally for the exchange of ideas and not beaten with a stick. 
Because that was the mining opened its books, their files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the funding of independent teams search that would have been able to clarify the issue. 
But Barrick Gold seems not to rely on public opinion and rejects the petitions and letters of support for the authors of noir Canada. 
Does Mr. Garver possibly could explain how you can ask for a "public" debate scorning the views of this? 
According to the Vice-President, it seems that this word lists only lawyers highly paid and not for all Canadians; this represents a very limited view of the concept. 
In a democracy, detractors also have the right to speak. 
What does not understand - or what is not to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public that maintains the authors and publishers of noir Canada especially because it rejects the brutal way of mining. 
The public is willing to listen to Barrick and judging him, but taking as civilized basis changes of arguments, and not in the framework of what many people perceive as a persecución-mordaza (pursuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold just depositing a requirement with regard to the authors of noir Canada intimando them not to use this word). 
Besides the surreal speech Mr. Garver, the process of Barrick Gold is a direct attack against freedom of search and University of truth, essential couple all democratic societies. 
Denied the right to quote credible sources and make a debate on the facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work. 
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that dislike to rich companies of this world in a country such as Canada, under penalty of many persecutions, who will do it? 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, could do so following scientific standards used by the authors of noir Canada. 
Has a right of reply. 
The university world, to which we belong, knows long debates and manage disagreements and resolve conflicts. 
The persecution of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what is intended, has no appetite to do a debate transparent. 
That is a loss for the university world, but also to the public debate in Canada, and it is time that governments affix devices to limit this type of proceedings. 
Rescue operation of Wall Street -- Democrats and Republicans agree 
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the most important economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
The new version of the plan $700 billion Americans that seeks to stop the financial crisis that is affecting Wall Street for months, must still be confirmed by both houses of Congress. 
Projected particularly: better control on the part of those elected its implementation, new mechanisms that seek to ensure the repayment of public money invested, the new provisions to contain the number of homes seized the lack of payment, as well as a right of scrutiny on salaries paid to the leaders of the often-quoted companies. 
The American Treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, the chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a marathon of negotiations Che lasted two days. 
"made great progress towards an agreement which will be effective in the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
"Everything has been done to covered the economy and ordinary Americans before the current crisis on Wall Street," explained the Democrat. 
"is the fundamental point: if we do this, the trauma, chaos and disturbances on the everyday lives of Americans will be immense," declared the Republican Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations had ended very rapidly in the last hours because they feared the effect that would lead to a new failure in the mood of investors. 
The last time that had set was the opening up of markets this morning. 
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, which have rallied late in the negotiations, were more favourable to the agreement, without forgetting however squeezing their discontent being forced to reach this nearly. 
The Democrat Senator Barack Obama he bestowed certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly that allow owners to maintain their home and on the salary of leaders of companies survivors by the state. 
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because the irresponsibility of some, there is to be commended. 
But these measures are necessary, "commented on American television. 
His Republican opponent, John McCain, interrogated in another string to know if would vote on the proposed plan, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote it." 
"The important points which I read [show] that is something that we have to digest and with which we can anticipate. 
He said that the option of doing nothing is not acceptable. " 
The $700 billion plan to buy with taxpayers' money debts, dubious assets at risk and unsaleable of American financial institutions. 
Comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of the mortgage credit risk before spreading to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and provoke a freezing of liquidity and an exodus of banks and financial institutions. 
It is a group of elected Republicans who had to change the first draft agreement, last week. 
We believe that we have come out of the stagnation since Democrats accepted that certain "toxic assets" of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased. 
With the objective of smoothing the rough edges to everyone in Congress, also added a provision which stated that if the government had to shoulder losses for five years with this program, could impose new fees that would help him to recover money. 
The new plan foresees the payment of a first part of 250 billion which will add 100 other billion if the president seems necessary. 
The payment of other 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote on the part of Congress. 
In exchange for their help, Washington achieved stakes in companies that earn him often-quoted dividends in case of profit and that he can return to sell when the storm will last. 
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the procedures of embargoes which related houses obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on remuneration and compensation in cash paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis. 
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote in the House of Representatives from today and to the Senate next Wednesday. 
Despite all their efforts, it is still not certain that his plan will be approved. 
Some people continued yesterday to protest against this project, both on the part of Republicans and Democrats. 
The Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Committee on Finance House, declared their constituents that "with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand". 
"We have a very serious financial problem. 
There are solutions. 
But not that consists in taking advantage of taxpayers. " 
The Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat who is a promoter of a small group in Congress, presents problems in another way, but reaches the same conclusion. 
"400 teachers of economy, including three Nobel laureates, we wrote to tell us: ask Congress not rush and carefully examine the route to be taken," said yesterday. 
In this same time, in Europe, had again the test of the global nature of the crisis. 
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16,3 billion dollars). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas gave to know that renunciaba buy its competitor in bankruptcy since lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) during the crisis in risky home loans in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85 000 people and form part of the 20 largest European banks and the ten largest insurers. 
"This is not money lost, said yesterday the Dutch finance minister, Wouter Bos. 
Instead, make a right to vote in the bank and influence. 
It is just something that savers and the families apreciaran now that times are uncertain. " 
During this time, on the other side of the channel, the British government nationalized seemed to another bank that suffers the financial crisis. 
According to the British press, the government would charge of all loans outstanding in the bank Bradford and Bringley and more than 41 billion euros (75,5 billion dollars) of home loans. 
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank. 
The bank Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, which the British government would nationalise since the beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon committed 
His blue eyes represented by both time its triumph. 
The American actor with a lovely smile had been released from their side narcissistic? 
Yes and no. 
His modesty, their sensitivity and a talent that was evident also will be removed from the register of power that have real sacred monsters. 
But what a great corridor of substance! 
Paul Newman, died Friday, at 83 years, because of a lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the years fanfare. 
It is less phenomenal that Brando, who seemed much and was seen for a long time as a rival in the cinema, more prudent in their game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the outbreak of the dramatic conventions. 
The blood mixed often children are magnificent. 
Was born in Ohio in 1925, German Jewish father and mother in Hungarian origin. 
These fledgling European roots, a glorious faces of the American dream. 
Without ego inhibition, last quality mark. 
Because he cast an entire country lover of the self made man, fighting of the war of the Pacific, wounded in combat, the principle of the 1950s studied art dramatic at Yale, then frecuentó the Actor's studio in New York, before triumph in theatre, television and soon in the cinema. 
This man who militó by civil rights was also the pilot car sweeping in second position in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a couple shapes formed from the 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward. 
He also disappear with the sides secrets of this secret star, unobtrusive and committed, allergic to the scandals of the world of the spectacle that we do not know very well. 
Is an honest man, in the widest sense of the word. 
The death of Paul Newman caused chaos to the cinema goers this weekend, while entrechoquen their large roles in the black screen memories. 
More than a half-century of American Art, the seventh in perpetual change marching through him. 
Many memories become to memory as the cow-boy with charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in Gata on the roof of zinc adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958. 
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr Bridge, fractured by a marriage that did not meet all its promises. 
Others like Paul Newman has gone in the history of cinema. 
Does this rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in somebody up there likes me (marked by hatred), Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, said after his death, that really launched at Newman in 1956. 
This mangante engaging in the suntuosa film the sting (the strike), Oscar to the best film in 1973. 
Bitter and Avenger ping pong player in the magnificent film The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), repeated the character in the colour of money from Martin Scorsese, which gave him in 1987, his only Oscar between nine nominations. 
This view that changes over the years, it was him. 
He still. 
The times change during his career. 
The young people I know thanks mainly to slap shot from George Roy Hill (1977), Reggie Dunlop, coach of a team of ice hockey Orthodox little. 
Its called anoraks returned to see it in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of COas brothers. 
With a final role of godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003, the picture was complete. 
Contrary to several legends of cinema that pretty soon abandoned the race, Newman stayed much in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its Oros, its fanfare and their concessions. 
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier we saw, with humour, "as a challenge that live in" The underplaying "and that Judge their benefits too supported. 
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman that roles came during a long time without doing anything. 
But less often interpreted the role of young Galán marginal neurotic:, alcoholics, cabrones or desperate, whose reflected traits revolts. 
As a film-maker, Newman revealed sides its true sensitivity púdica not very well known. 
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife, Joanne Woodward in the main role, described a female portrait of melancholy. 
He lost his son Scott because of overdoses devoted his film Harry and are in 1984, the work of shame and sadness. 
"Among the numerous tributes which unfolded yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (had worked together in the sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) claimed, very saddened:" My life and my country were better thanks to its existence " 
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the actor died. 
On the other side of his career of legend, is also a great campaigner for civil rights, ecology, the independent film, a glamour against the excesses of Hollywood. 
We have seen much of their expensive reign on the boats of juice vinagreta, sauces, cookies and other foods, prosecuting this method as a method of bad taste, although it started as a joke. 
The advantages of these sales were given to his foundation for childhood in difficulty. 
Newman, rather than be content of his myth, will be compromised until the end. 
They left their five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star. 
It was a privilege to be there. " 
And a privilege for us to have followed the careers of an American artist lucid and so generous. 
In short, a model citizen. 
What is produced at the factory of bills Zuschlag & amp; Co.? 
Very soon, on 8 October, will begin the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and their accomplices. 
It accuses the politician and his accomplices of committing fraud of significant damage, so business, continuously and in an organised manner in addition to other crimes, including falsification of documents. 
According to the prosecutor used for their own ends the funds obtained in public tenders justifying on many occasions the fulfilment of tasks with false receipts. 
Public funds and municipalities - in its entirety around 65 million Huf - stop in part on the Treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and partly in the pocket of individuals. 
The method, which was published by researchers also was to justify the take-up of funds obtained in public contracts with false bills behind which had not actual implementation, various associations never fulfilled its obligations. 
According to the indictment, the majority of bills were false. 
This got the talonarios in the market in the District of Józsefváros circulars and stamps were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas. 
And the question of who in the name of what company should make the bill falsified decided among others at the Tour by the higher the Balaton region where János Zuschlag sent István sides. 
The latter confessed that for this purpose should choose hostales and restaurants. 
Asked bill for their consumption and these served model for drawing up bills that were among other contests in the Ministry of sports and youth affairs at the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, as well as in the city of the capital. 
These bills were signed in his majority by István sides and his accomplice András Őri, who according to our information rather wrote reports needed to obtain public subsidies. 
During one of their "study tours" sides chose a brewery. 
According to two bills issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and their accomplices, such culinary center provided food for a group of 90 people from the Association Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
However, according to the manager of the centre - many people have no place at the time in this place. 
Similarly, the bill issued in the summer of 2002 to the foundation Jobb Jövőért - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal errors and contextual. 
Because a Hostal the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not be kept there in one night, however in the bill taken cent and 30 people. 
But the manufacturers of bill of great fantasy when were also pointed to the culinary center Pigal KFT. As the teneduría books of the same, according to the information given to the prosecutor - had not documents on behalf of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá. 
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, he reported to hvg. Hu that when he was quoted by the prosecutor and showed invoices, already knew that it was false documents. 
"In the seal the name of our company and the NIF appeared instead incorrect." 
Added: in addition to the formal problems nor was that according to the bill housed a hundred people, since they have only eleven rooms in which there is no room for so many people. 
In addition, the bill was also included meals, while the restaurant long ago that does not work. 
The enthusiastic manufacturers of bills are not reported nor that the travel agency elected in Budapest organizes exclusively trips abroad, as in the bill of payment service indicated foolishly as a trip in Hungary, which also coincided with the practice of issuing bills of the agency. 
In addition - as they learned during the investigation - included in the document VAT, too, despite the fact that travel outside the territory of the European Union were exempt from taxes. 
Among other things the extent of VAT also was incorrect in the four documents issued by the hotel Révfülöp KFT. For the foundation Jobb Jövőért, since the services of this company are not loaded with a 25 but with only 15 percent of VAT, furthermore employees only extendían hotel bills made at machine but the bill was Handbook. 
In addition to the "shippers" committed other mistakes too, as in the case of a company in which set in the bill as activity conducted road transport to which - they learned during investigations of the prosecutor - not the company founded as a consultant investments. 
Equally by formal differences - format inadequacy of the bill, seal false - they knew that are false invoices issued to Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány for 21st. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont. 
As in the case of Ravenna BT. Or sports camp Kunfehértó, whose representatives refused to have issued these bills. 
Counterfeiters nor gave attention to that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there (2001) the Hib KFT. In Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, hence the head of the process of liquidation, according to our information - negated have issued such a document. 
The Bills issued 
Another group of manufacturers of false bills are composed of those which were aware that should be issued bills fiction. 
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued bill for value of some four million Huf on behalf of the foundation Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért. 
The manager of the Collab KFT. -- According to the indictment convinced - as one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, for issuing bills fiction. 
Similarly with Zuschlag works and their accomplices the Biogate KFT., currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 supplied bills by an approximate value of five million to the foundation Jobb Huf Jövőért Alapítvány, Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, without real economic activity. 
There was no movement of capital, either, because cancelled after bills ready but forgot to put on their documents to this entity. 
In the next group of manufacturers of false bills include those who have some link with the defendants. 
So, for example, Ivan Kubatov was demandadero the Ukrainian manager of the Delta trio SL with fictitious headquarters in Budapest, which dealt with the trade of fuels and vehicles. 
This company issued numerous bills for a value of approximately 18 million Huf in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media. 
According to data from research these bills were bought for cash investment KFT. Of Kiskunhalas, since 14 September 2005 is under liquidation process. 
The manager of this company was a Romanian who Ivan Kubatov should have dispatched also documents related to the firm between 2002 and 2005. 
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that issued on behalf of the company bills for the Atlasz, for the Hoppá and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány charging the amount himself. 
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari KFT. And Jos-Investment founded by BT. Albañiles Romanians to express request of Ivan Kubatov. 
However, none of the companies worked effectively due - according to the defendant - that didn't work. 
But took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his lawyer Szente Zsolt accomplice, who prepared the registration documents from the company, issued bills on behalf of societies for organisations linked with Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generáció. 
Kubatov on behalf of the cash investment, the Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos investment and Linaxtrade gave overall 15 bills to different entities for a value of 14,2 million Huf. 
The prosecutor found that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the bills. 
This man even took the society in comandita Szi-Beri issued bills for fiction used in the Pont Biztos contest. 
The Y-Generáció and Szövetség to modern Magyarországért presented a contest in the month of January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (MRI), public utility entity of the Socialist Party. 
The contest got 500 thousand Huf respectively, but not used the money to the objectives of the contest. 
For this is not discovers, presented the MRI five fictitious invoices received the works team KFT. 
These bills were discovered during the registration of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education. 
Part of the defendants in the trial will probably relatarán - as they did in the prosecutor - the course of falsified invoices. 
The most interesting may be the confession of the main accused János Zuschlag, if it decides to dismantle everything. 
Since their confessions until now have not been very detailed and although repeatedly promised to talk about everything that it has not done until the present. 
The question is: What interest is doing this?, perhaps in exchange for the return of the bulk of the money - fifty million Huf - the Socialists came to an agreement with him to Zusi assume all the responsibilities. 
Who, moreover, for these days until it could offend, since to alleviate their prison conditions applied for house arrest, but he was denied repeatedly. 
While the numerous authors of crimes economic value far superior, which never returned the money, walk freely or at least can expect in your own home the judgment, he has no possibility for that. 
The sobrepuestas psychology: why we spend more money? 
The participants of auctions are prone to spend more money and overvaluing the product. 
The neurólogos and economists from the University of New York discovered the neurological basis - economic this conduct known and seemingly irrational. 
According to the study appeared in the journal Science, people do not want to lose in competences as eBay auctions, so prefers to pay even a overpriced. 
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental auction. 
One of the groups of volunteers played lottery, another participated in an auction, and meanwhile was examined by the system of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) areas of the brain are active participants in the experiment. 
In both games could earn money participants, but during auctions, where it is essential element to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the functioning of the complex called placed stratum below the cerebral cortex. 
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "car prize" of the nervous system. 
So according to the scientists, the rise of betting explains as a prevention in order not to provoke a reaction intense the layer. 
For basing his theory, economists of the scientific group conducted a study of financial monitoring. 
In this experiment three groups who bet against a person in different circumstances. 
In the control group simply told him the real value of the product in question, and its members bet. 
Another group besides that he promised that if he wins, would receive $15 more prize. 
In exchange, the third group received exactly 15 dollars before the auction, but in the event of losing the auction the members of the group perdían even this money. 
The only difference between the two groups was that for you highlighted the triumph and for another failure. 
However, tested the hypothesis of the neurólogos, members of the group that playing "against the failure" were willing to bet even more members of the control group and the group "winner." 
"These results cannot be deducted from any economic theory previously existing. 
Since those until now saying the phenomena of auctions solely with the joy of winning and the prevention of risks. 
Only the visual neurological methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so that now come to a third explanation "- established Andrew Schotter, professor of economics faculty of the University of New York. 
Hepatitis: when it should go to the doctor? 
Worldwide about 1.5 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary the chronic liver disease is considered one of the main causes of death. 
It is estimated at $100 the number of infected in this country, but just seven thousand receive treatment for many sufferers do not know they are infected. 
The designation of hepatitis is the common name of different liver disease caused by a virus. 
The symptoms are much; they are characteristic infection of the liver and ictericia, but its pathogens and diseases caused are very different. 
The hepatitis viruses in dependence of the pathogen spread through two main forms: hepatitis A and E for food way (for example with water or food contagiado), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and with bodily whims (semen, mood of the vagina, froth). 
It is advisable to travellers to protect themselves by vaccine against the virus and B, C vaccines do not exist. 
Symptoms of hepatitis appear to two or three weeks after eating infected food, manifested by means of a bad state General, weakness, nausea and abdominal pain. 
After that appear on the skin and in the paper in the eyes of the ictericia, excremento is clear, dark urine color and cure may last even two, three weeks. 
A million people die annually in the world in cancer and cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease. 
The main reason for this is that, according to the calculations, only one in ten infected receives pharmacological treatment. 
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment can produce cirrhosis of the liver and even cancer. 
Most of those infected do not know who is ailing because this pathological gradually destroys agent in liver cells and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later. 
It is therefore very important recognition premature, the systematic medical control. 
It is much more frequent this disease into three groups: those who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug users, and those who have tattoos. 
Today there are about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C. 
As this disease can be found with a routine check laboratory, deserves the death penalty also consult with the doctor of the family to experience some symptom unknown. 
The disease has cured if discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus in the body, so we can suppress the spread and prevent the cancer. 
On 30 September is the World Hepatitis Day, which was organised for the first time in 2004 by organisations representing patients. 
Its aim is to call attention to the causes of chronic infection of the liver caused by viruses and the importance of their recognition premature. 
Why it hurts less to who believe in God? 
Depending on the outcome of a recent research, religious faith has calmante effect that aliviaba also the death of the martyrs of Catholicism. 
Scientists from the University of Oxford study conducted an interesting experiment: that religious belief in what way influences the human pain -- reported the British newspaper The Telegraph. 
In the context of this unique experiment applied electrical shock to 12 faithful Catholics and the same number of atheists, meanwhile, were all looking a painting of the Virgin Mary. 
According to the results, the faithful Catholics were able to exclude the bulk of their pain. 
Thanks to the technique of escaneo of the human brain, was able to verify that the faithful Catholics were able to activate the part of your brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain. 
This experiment is the first of a series of investigations in which the side of academics also involved scientists, philosophers and theologians of the different departments in the university. 
The analysis was as follows; set a sparkling instrument to the left hand of the patient, which applied the electrical shock. 
Researchers asked participants in the experiment who set their sights on two paintings; to the Virgin Mary, the work of Sassoferrato of the 17th century and the lady of the ermine of Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century. 
Researchers had hoped that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary provoke some religious mood among the faithful, in both that chose the oil because of Leonardo, because it was not too different from the other, and thought he had a calming effect. 
Patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving electrical shocks in that period 20 in four successive parts while saw the paint of religious issue or the other. 
Catholics claimed that look to the Virgin Mary was felt in "security" as "protected persons" reassured "and in their hearts hung peace." 
Observing the picture of religious theme felt a 12 percent less pain looked when the work of Leonardo. 
The psychologist Michael Farias also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so striking a similar effect can be achieved with atheists, too, there are only to find the right image. 
"We should find the portrait of a person for that feel very positively, as a mother or father" - said the psychologist. 
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation. 
"The exercise of faith should and, in many cases really change our personality," Wright added. 
After these formidable results is a single question: What effect would be for the regulation of the pain if you show the faithful the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of his stature? 
Does the vision of a Virgin Mary high quality would give even better results? 
You are what you say of you same 
In his 10th birthday the Google can say: you can find both in the pockets of the people, as in the sky above his head; he knows where spent his holidays, what doctors visit and what interests them. 
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the executives of the company, this is still not enough. 
On the other hand the sceptics who do a parallel with the vision orweliana not see the essence of the Web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt recently said to the newspaper Financial Times that Google ’ s main goal is to bring together the greatest possible number of personal data about their users, and this is necessary in order to meet the original objectives of the founders of Google: "meet in a system all the reports of the world!" 
According to the leader of Google, the company even after ten years of work that revolvió the world is still in the initial phase of the effort to treat all the information. 
The question that what is going to happen within five years Schmidt replied: I would like the Google could answer questions like "What do tomorrow?" or "what would work best be me?" - but the software will not be able to answer questions apparently as simple as there are not enough information to users. 
Not all Internet users are aware that during his navigation are stored on the network with precision the keywords clicked, directions of IP and pages where spent at the end of the search. 
Thanks for example to personalized search that began two years ago, users can store their own record of navigation, can return to consult it sought before, which opened, and thanks to this record generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic will be based on the recommendations, in which the system we offer products and services on the basis of preferences previously defined and stored. 
What will happen if my data advantage against my same, if collected information on my activities? -- ask those users who are seeing the informational monopoly of Google. 
In most cases, rather the potential represented by the company is what may be fearful, and not the remorse, the fear of punishment, the yearning for freedom or rebellion against power. 
However it is already a fact confirmed that not only retain, but in some cases also justifiable cede to third all expressions clicked, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of surfers. 
The example discussed in recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against paedophiles Brazilians, when Google handed the Brazilian government reports on its Web site, called Orkut, to identify paedophiles. 
By contrast, Internet users who are concerned about the rights of individuals in the month of May is aliviaron when the company along with the EFF, organization for the defence of the electronic rights, demonstrated successfully before the court which was right in its dispute with the FBI: according to the ruling, they would not be able to force through Google, none of those parts of the constitution to provide any kind of information requested in secret by the FBI. 
(At the same time, the federal government has managed to achieve a pretext to strengthen the law on the protection of children adopted years ago, nearly fifty thousand Web addresses and a few thousand clicked phrases, but without obtaining lists of search for individual users, nor full lists of websites and key words in the past two months). 
So it is quite contradictory opinion on the Google: we criticize those who fear provide their personal data because they think that harms their privacy, their private life to begin to use the services of Google, and they are rebelling against her as against multinational companies of conservative image. 
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic supporters, users and users of other countries, see them as the future generation, "Corporation of avant-garde", not just to his rival, Microsoft, classified by their windows as conquering the world, as much as both fighting for the same goal. 
This can happen because Google instead of Microsoft, not asks users no identification code, or money for their applications, the code is open and the package of free program currently constantly, and seems more youthful, more collaborator who practice of official of the software giant. 
But it may also be because the geek see precisely the very problematic relationship that exists between the rights of the people and the Internet that came just for one of the key words more mentioned in recent years: the Web 2.0. 
The Web 2.0 is collaboration, deliberate trace behind us and take the channels of communication available, and while the measures several of these individually, the essence remains the same: to show ourselves. 
A normal person can have in numerous collective profile pages, from Facebook until Xanga, and may even join them with other services, such as for example the Twitter or last. FM that offers list of their customs of music, then these can include in a monitoring system like FriendFeed or blip. FM, can have a blog, which automatically appear the most recent galleries of photos that were stored in the Flickr or Picasa. 
We know many cases follows that, for example, the girlfriend, see the flow of photographs of the next morning of the entire common friends, who spent the previous evening with her fiancé fraudulent or can fire an employee of a company because this writes his opinion sincere in her blog about the direction of the company: One thing is certain, the definition of private life is revalorizó completely. 
Life "on-line," a person is what it shows itself - this is the definition that hides behind the conduct of the youth of our days. 
And who wants to hide something, or at least to sidestep the monopoly of Google, can do (beginning for example with the Scroogle which uses the system of search to Google, but leaves no fingerprints). 
There are many people who do not want to register in the collective pages to avoid that can find, but you can replace applications on-line "Google", since the software of drafting of texts to the applications of image and reading of news with alternative versions which were not connect with huge server or prepare the profile more perfect possible on us. 
The public expects almost that openly on the day that the Google to show his true colors. 
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than the IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), the land of AdWords advertising revenue / adsense threaten advertising agencies, in both the services that are increasingly rapidly cause severe headaches not only for Microsoft, but also many other companies software developers. 
However, observers critics find alarming contradictions: for example the direction superior flatly rejected the protest of employees then doubling of the price of nursery school of the company, considered too expensive unlimited number of feeding employees, but all of this is nothing compared with the fact that in 2006 the Google caved in to pressure from the Chinese government and the company, according to the whole agreement leaking information that violating the good morals and the interests of the Chinese regime. 
One of the internal regulations of the company, says that there will be announcing a new service in advance, but only when it was ready to work, what is certain is that if the anticipated problems in the coming months and years will be looking to the world: while some believe that the draft escaneo and archiving books and magazines of Google acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the United States Supreme Court, others fear of its health system, because it can create our own full health profile, with previous analysis, with our doctors and our problems. 
And the fact that Google will create a genetic database, it can provide a good raw material for the writers of works of science fiction, Scroogled, novel of the popular Cory Doctorow, describes in the form orweliana this future, in which a man only data from Google can be described alarmingly well. 
Two minors helped to erase the traces to the author of the double murder of the city of Ózd. 
The police questioned two minors on the double murder of Ózd who, under suspicion, helped to erase the traces of the crime - said Tuesday the station spokesman of the general public order in the province of Borsod. 
The young acknowledged the crime that I was accused, and now they fautores accused of the crime. 
The two minors, according to the reports, the Hungarian news agency is two girls - can defend itself in freedom. 
The complicity can receive up to five years in prison. 
The accused of the double murder of Ózd - a man of 23 years - is in detention since Sunday. 
He accused the crime of killing several people with premeditation and by greed. 
During investigations revealed that the young 23 years owed him a large sum to a man of 53 years. 
The defendant not wanted to pay its debt, so the Wednesday last week cited its creditor to the headquarters of a company of Ózd, where it killed and then killed also the daughter of 9 years of the victim. 
According to information from the Tim, the young was prepared to perpetrate long before the crime, as committed the murder with a weapon previously concealed in the place of the crime. 
The police analyzes with an expert witness to the weapon and the circumstances of their use. 
The exchange of Warsaw tabled an offer to buy the stock exchange of Prague 
The stock exchange of Warsaw offered two hundred billion -- roughly five billion Czech crowns - by 100% of the shares of the stock exchange of Prague. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the stock exchange of Warsaw confirmed the offer made Poles, despite the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw bag of prospective new owners of the stock exchange of Prague. 
The reason is that the stock of Warsaw is in the hands of the state. 
99% of the shares is in the hands of the Polish state that within a few months, wants to sell 60% of them. 
The Czech E15 economic daily reported that the supply of Poles has been the highest among those offered by the interested by the exchange of Prague. 
According to the Czech press, until now gave supply the Vienna stock exchange, the transatlantic exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange, the Deutsche Börse. 
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week that among those interested the worst new owner would be the stock exchange of Warsaw and not ruled out the possibility that this, in a future collapses the stock exchange of Prague. 
Experts estimate the value of the stock exchange of Prague in about 5 to 10 billion kronor. 
According to the agreement of shareholders could sell roughly 90% of the shares. 
The majority owner of the stock exchange of Prague is the investment bank finance homeland with a stake of about 25 per cent, he remains the bank Ceská Sporitelna FF 14.7 with Tiger and holding four S. A. R A.L. with 13.5 percent. 
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press 
The major European newspapers in his remarks on Tuesday dedicated to the increasingly deep international financial crisis speak of a "second September 11". 
The global financial catastrophe is due to the US president - believes the republic of Rome - the President has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the bill made hurriedly, whose goal is to give solution to this desperate situation... 
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", who spoke the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk of a "second September 11". 
According to a part of the press madrileña, Washington is the scapegoat. 
In view of the world the error of the political leadership of the United States was the leading to the world economy on the brink of the abyss. 
A growing danger of the collapse of the American monetary system and this course, will affect the whole world. 
Although the Bush plan was not perfect, after the vote in Congress comes the danger that Washington does not offer political instrument to deal with the crisis. 
The world economy is suspended in the air - precisely when carried out one of the biggest changes in the history of capitalism. 
We cannot ignore this threat - points the Tages-Anzeiger in Geneva. 
Some states, even today, can throw him belt of lifeline to financial institutions, which could save them jittery as bankruptcy with taxpayers' money. 
But if, as the bank sway crumble further still, then it will not suffice, nor the new funds, nor the new improvisations. 
We need long term that Member States of the European Union set aside his nationalistic egoism and bring together control over financial markets fragmented. 
Financial institutions in crisis received only Monday more than 100 billion euros - recalls the Viennese der standard, adding that are increasingly real concerns that, as did the Americans, also the European taxpayers will have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis. 
The EU until now has not been taken seriously with the crisis that passes as a cradle me on the old continent. 
"saviours" will not present immediately hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if defined: in what cases justified using taxpayers' money to avoid a greater evil? 
The intelligent car imitates the flight of the abejorro 
What would be the best method for developing technologies to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of sensors existing obstacles in nature? 
For example, the abejorros. 
In a surprising project presented at the CEATEC Japan, the abejorros gave the starting point for the Nissan engineers to design the next generation of the system of prevention of the collisions. 
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, devised the system of robotics direction of cars kind BR23C copier of nature, which gave the characteristics of the abejorros, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can sidestep all the collisions. 
During the flight each abejorro creates its own particular space oval sign that actually resembles our housing protector of security - explained in the explanatory Kazuhhiro Doi RP, director of technology and research and development. 
Play an important role in the eyes of the abejorros compounds that are able to see in all directions in a higher angle at 300 degrees. 
To copy the function of the eyes compounds, engineers used the system for measuring the length by lasers. 
This identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, estimated its distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of vehicle that immediately becomes a manoeuvre to avoid the collision. 
In a fraction of seconds it identifies the obstacle, then the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the abejorros, alters the direction turning to the extent necessary the wheels. 
Unlike any existing system today, this move is totally instinctive. 
"If it were not so, the robot of the vehicle could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, chief of the laboratory of mobility and the project of the robot vehicles. 
Must react immediately and instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the inner layer more vulnerable to the housing in a protective layer of security, within which is currently considered inevitable all kinds of collisions. 
The entire process must reflect what makes a abejorro to sidestep other abejorros. 
This process must be done in an open and close their eyes. 
However, unlike the abejorros, the movement cannot address upwards or downwards, diagonal, but can only be bidimensional and exclusively in the direction of turn of the wheel 
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for the abejorros to sidestep other abejorros, here only used as a possibility for the robot of the car the rotating movement and the acceleration in addition the frenaje. 
The BR23C uses of lítio-polímero batteries are lighter and is increasing its energy density, meaning that they have a long life span more than lítio-ión. 
According to Andoh, what is important is the instinctive reaction and intelligent and not the capacity of processing of data, far less the storage. 
This device in every second only to prosecute some signs of entry and react according to the case. 
It is not necessary to store such data or react with an instinctive logic based on data from the previous games, so it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory. 
Do not need memoirs of gigabytes, or megabyte optical fibre cables. 
This is the first step in developing technology to sidestep immediately obstacles, which estimates of the Nissan, within ten years can be incorporated into the models manufactured in series. 
Another possibility for its implementation is to incorporate the unity of the satellite navigation system for GPs to take the driver to their fate, sidestepping the existing obstacles in their way. 
Name already has this costly child 
It has prepared the written version of the law of the financial rescue package of 700 billion dollars that apply in several stages with the intent to buy bad loans from banks. 
In the first phase will be spent half the money. 
According to schedule of the East Coast during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement on the financial rescue package of 700 billion dollars in total, after several days of discussions, the Reuters reported. 
We have achieved an important progress - said Democrat Nancy Pelosi, president of the American Congress, claiming that lack just formalize the agreement on a document. 
The commitment on the package was supported by both candidates for the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Henry Paulson, the finance minister, talking about the outcome of the compromise said: This program will work and be efficient but other measures are needed most. According to Pelosi, not to save the Wall Street, but to give back to the length of the economy. 
The written version of the package was published before the opening of markets in Asia, i.e. Sunday before 8 p.m. last night, according to Washington (i.e. hours before the two in the early hours of Monday, according to schedule of Central Europe), without causing a spectacular leap in the bags. 
On the draft law called the emergency law to economic stabilization of the year 2008, the Monday vote first Congress and then the Senate. 
President George W. Bush on the night of Saturday, consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the agreement. 
We are happy with the progress achieved during the night and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman. 
The program is different from the original proposal, the Bush administration to spend all the 700 billion dollars to buy securities of loan fund of poor quality. 
Only now can spend half of the 700 billion dollars, using 250 billion that Congress immediately after the vote, probably on Monday, this sum the Ministry of Finance of the fund will buy securities, bad credit rating and the fate of another $100 billion depend on the decision of the president. 
This programme will be controlled by a special body, in which also involved the President of the Federal Reserve. 
The other half of the 700 billion dollars will be spent after a new decision of Congress. 
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactics can simultaneously: buy bad loans, mortgages and securities of credit fund, in addition to other loans type "poisonous" also. 
The purchase will make in auctions or directly - reported people responsible for the ministry. 
The law allows affected companies participating in a program of certain where the finance portfolio ensures the worrying elements, for which companies will pay the amount corresponding to the damage predictable. 
Henry Paulson stated: the law ensures so the necessary financial resources, which until may get even 700 billion dollars to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, be it the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some large financial institutions. 
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as they sign - added. 
Instead, the heads of banks that are in distress and expect help from the state will be able to count on the official limiting their damages, which the American jargon simply called Golden parachutes. 
Only in some cases certain payments will be restricted, besides the limitations depend on the form of assistance from the Ministry of Finance. 
The limitation means that if the Ministry buys in the framework of an auction, it will impose an extra tax for the golden parachutes, unless you retire the head failed in the bank. 
To directly buy bad loans the government will act aggressively to ensure that compensation of heads are not exaggerated. 
In addition to this is not going to change the contracts of golden parachutes existing limitations refer only to new contracts to stimulate so participation in the program. 
This is the first case in American history that will be in force a legal limit for the incomes of the CEOs - commented that the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee of Congress, responsible for financial services. 
The state also will have the right to buy shares of banks involved in the programme, thus reducing the risk to taxpayers, because ultimately may even profit with the transaction as the economy recovers, and with it the bank. 
According to the draft law in the next five years, the president must submit to Congress in the form of a proposal on how to restore the taxpayer losses in the financial sector. 
Of course on both sides were those who expressed reservations with regard to the project. 
This is not what we were American citizens, i.e. are not protecting the taxpayer dollars -- declared the Republican congressman from California, Darrell Issa. 
His colleague, Democrat of Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: The measures urged him the same that are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for around 12 January the agreement enters into force norteamericano-húngaro concerning the granting of visas - the foreign minister spoke of this in Chicago, before Hungarians residing there. 
In his opinion, "virtually everything depends on being built in time on the other side of the Atlantic the electronic system of access and control". 
At the same time warned that the new system will disappear from the premiso entry, but tourists before his departure from the country of origin must register. 
From today, the leader of the Hungarian diplomacy holds talks in Washington. 
Is having talks with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice handing him the medium-size cross with the star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and sustained negotiations with the international political advisers to the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain. 
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of the financial rescue package for banks. 
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two big parties Americans Sunday ensured his support for the aid programme banking 700 million dollars of the administration, on the other hand there are politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister. 
Representatives of the Congress and the administration, after negotiations for several days of marathon, in the early hours of Sunday announced: it came to an agreement of principles on the financial rescue package for banks. 
The financial package to solve the crisis on Wall Street and unfreeze the credit market frozen, became the central issue of the campaign for the presidential election. 
Both Obama and McCain want to demonstrate that they are more capable than his rival to lift the country out of the economic crisis. 
According to the most recent polls, to be put at the forefront of the economic issues, Obama returned to gain advantage and disappeared the advantage of McCain that he had obtained after the Republican convention with the nomination of Sarah Palin to the vice-presidency.

Obama said on the CBS that McCain not played any role in the consultations, instead he consulted daily with the minister. 
The president of the Congress, Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that congressmen probably already vote on Monday on the bill. 
Magazine of the press area of speaks German 
The group of right is intact, only within the group became voters more aware - says the Der Spiegel on the weak electoral outcome of the CSU in Bavaria. 
Haider and his supporters are ready to govern in Austria to prevent a coalition rojinegro. 
Der Spiegel (Spiegel). 
In the electronic edition of the German magazine left Franz Walter, in its article entitled "The Revolution of Bavaria devours their parents" analyzes the motives of the dramatic defeat of the CSU. 
According to the famous political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had started long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had assumed office. 
The Christian Socialists for several decades were developing in Bavaria - and now precisely these modern citizens are those who give the back. 
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian Democracy, also of Angela Merkel. 
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but ended Sunday is a process that is already envisaged for almost ten years ago: disappeared undisputed hegemony of a party of state. 
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU got a 47,7 percent, for the first time below 50% since the 1950s. 
This is repeated three years ago, in the election of the Bundestag 2005, i.e. even during the oft-mentioned Stoiber era. 
The reason for this is the modernization of the CSU in the province devorador of their parents. 
Sociologists already 40 years ago have been forecasting this, but in the long wrong. However, secularization, the results of education and the settling of Germans from the north in the developed regions of Bavaria had its negative consequences on the loyalty of the voters of the CSU. 
With the modernization will also raise the chances and it also has political consequences. 
The group of right is intact, only within the group became voters more aware, more critical and more stubborn. 
It is amazing that in recent weeks fairly conventional groups of citizens were those who left more of the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrial, and those who have a high school diploma. 
Is recudió to less than 40 percent support for the CSU. 
Die Presse - diepresse (COM). 
The conservative newspaper in Vienna: "Who with whom? In his article entitled" The presidents of the parties are very reserved in matters of Coalition "- deals with the predicament of internal politics after the Austrian elections. 
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ interference in its internal affairs. 
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, the Greens instead still do not want to do consultations on the coalition. 
Elections were held now, everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public television, the leaders of the parties were barely see something of their horses. 
Werner Faymann, president of the SPÖ, confirmed that wants to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to prove that it is possible to collaboration between the two parties - this already exists in some provinces and social associations. 
Fayman left open the question that if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molter, the current president of the ÖVP, in the post of Vice-Chancellor. 
He said that in any case the age of Schüssel-Molterer were unhappy. 
It is not possible to follow this trend policy. 
Mr Molterer reacted cautiously to the red bids. 
He said that probably will not be successful cooperation if Faymann tries to meddle in the internal affairs of the ÖVP. 
Even if the party is open to elect the opposition or joining the coalition, these issues should be discussed without doubt, within the ÖVP. 
The president of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider was opened in all directions. 
"to prevent the coalition roja-negra, we are ready to assume responsibility of the government", said Haider. 
Járóka: we need to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation 
Today it has initiated in Paris the European summit to equality of opportunity, your host is France that this year is also president of the European Union. 
Lívia Járóka, a member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in his message to the full, as one of the main speakers of this meeting, called the attention of segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations afflicting children gypsies and furthermore is also the largest obstacle before the prevale foundation of their interests. 
This high-level conference was inaugurated - on behalf of the French presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Social Affairs and Employment and by Vladimir Spidla, the European Commissioner responsible for jobs, social affairs and equal opportunities. 
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations of protection of social rights. 
Járóka, according to the Bureau of the press of the group of members of the Fidesz in the European Parliament - warned that apart from discrimination in employment, Gypsies are outside the labour market in the first place by its low level of attendance. 
"The bulk of the young Gypsies have not finished teaching middle and due to the poor quality of primary education, only a negligible part can obtain University diploma". 
Besides Járóka highlighted that education, as a fundamental human right, has a crucial role in the prevale Foundation of other human rights, too. 
Investment in the education of children Gypsies at an early age can strengthen the economies of the Member States of the European Union. 
According to the stupidity, it is necessary concientizar widely these issues both among gypsies as among those not gypsies. 
For while more early starting school a Gypsy student, more likely to have to become an active member of the labour market; through taxes on income and consumption, they will also contribute to the national budget. 
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must assure them the right to a quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated education and low level" - highlighted Lívia Járóka. 
According to the stupidity, the objective is necessary unity and active European Union immediately to accelerate processes of school desegregation, for that is of fundamental importance to the proper enforcement of existing anti-discrimination directives and planned. 
"We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer children Gypsies the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens rights" -- demanded Járóka. 
The aim of the European summit to equal opportunities organised annually since the meeting Berliner last year which was held in a sign of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities, "is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European level and at the level of the national Member States. 
CSU grace for a transitional period. 
At the end of October will take a decision on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein duo 
Despite the serious electoral defeat, have not yet been severed heads in the way of the Bavarian CSU, for the moment it has postponed the debate about personal issues. 
Erwin Huber, the chairman of the party and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in their posts, but it is not known how long lasting the Grace. 
The fate of the duo, who suffered a catastrophic electoral defeat of 17 percent, will decide in the extraordinary Congress of the party, to be held the last weekend of October. 
The members of the widely criticized duo hinted: not cling to their jobs. 
With that sought to reassure the angry members of his group and its organisation, who a day after the Bavarian "tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of an absolute majority. 
Five years ago, although under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, who was at the pinnacle of his career -- CSU reached a 60.7%, instead now, a year after the coup against Stoiber crowded, managed only a 43.4 percent. 
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria that gives 18% of GDP. 
Although in the southern province of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives remain dominant in the future will undoubtedly make coalition with someone. 
As the first sign of the restructuring of the party, the vice president Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of the possible successors of Huber, also has a seat on the small group of intelligence that initiates negotiations with the liberal FDP and with voters free right about a possible coalition government in Munich. 
How strange the destination is on the list of voters free enters parliament he Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was taken to the coup of the duo Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly deleted from the stage to the ambitious local policy. 
The leaders of the CSU are investing all their energies to stabilise Beckstein. 
In the transition will receive an active role Stoiber also that until now was moving the rope in the fund, the ex-jefe provincial government and former chairman of the CSU described the 28 September day as the most bitter of his political career. 
The Monday Huber made some critical comments on the CDU, in his opinion, warranted much more support from the party brother. 
Other politicians of the CSU interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and the own Angela Merkel too. 
After the elections in September 2009 of the Bundestag, Merkel will not be chancellor if they are not capable of enhancing together at the CSU who played a key role in the success of national elections of 2005. 
Under Merkel, could barely hide his disappointment at the failure of the CSU losses not will impact negatively on the Berlin grand coalition. 
Which of course is relative: it will be easier to treat the CSU wounded and the crisis of the Social Democrats continued. 
The SPD with its 18.6 percent reached their worst result since 1946 in Bavaria. 
The opposition of Lukashenko 110-0: 
After Sunday ’ s elections, there will be no opposition MP in the Belarusian parliament. 
According to the Russian observers, this explains the welfare and stability which guarantees in the country, Aleksandr Lukashenko, instead, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this explains rather with violations of the law committed during the count of the votes. 
The OSCE sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the election result. 
While the legislature of the country of 10 million inhabitants, integrated percent and ten members, more than a decade ago has no opposition, before yesterday's elections the opposition United under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for a fourth time renewed his mandate after the elections of 2006 of dubious legitimacy, by consequence of amending the constitution would allow this time, "" the entry of some members of the opposition in Parliament. 
The ODSZ suppressed the boycott, which originally wanted to do. 
At the bottom of the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, which increasingly depends more economically from Russia - which took a credit to temper the importation of natural gas increasingly face of Russia and that contributed to the sale to Russia the Beltransgaz, owner of the pipeline that passes through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which gives permission for entry to Lukashenko and other politicians of high level by having a political regime considered undemocratic. 
It was a sign of detente when the OSCE, to assess the election campaign, placed more emphasis on positive phenomena and not about mistakes - such as, for example, the prohibition of participating imposed on one-third of opposition candidates. 
However the primary report on Monday of the OSCE criticised even own campaign - in which the opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the tally of votes. 
With all this in view of the opposition feels an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready to a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhasia in Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - a month ago that considers the two regions as independent. 
- have taken two steps forward and one back, but what is more important is that it has initiated dialogue between Belarus and the European Union -- declared our newspaper Alyaksandr Milinkevich. 
According to the opposition candidate in the presidential elections of 2006 is desirable to keep this situation, despite fears that "the regime to allow the entry of even an opponent in this Parliament without weight." 
The opposition is not planning to organise demonstrations in protest at the results, rather trying to reach voters his message on the need to make economic reforms. 
- this clear we cause many problems because we need to print the opposition press in Russia, local authorities put difficulties with their distribution, but even so I see that are increasingly those who support the contrast between the elderly - said Milinkevich, referring to the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main outcome is the creation of social security, did not consider appropriate or even retirees, which officially are the most subsidised by the regime. 
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the rise in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time the breakdown of social security that "resembles the silence of the cemeteries" - argued Milinkevich. 
Russian observers to the opposite of the opposition politician called for democratic elections. 
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States declared to the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds", so that the lack of the opposition is not anything that the testimony of the maturity of the Belarussian voters. 
Brunetta: "now in most desayuna before they start work." 
Never happened in the history of palace that houses Chigi automatic doors for controlling the entry and exit of the staff. 
But since today begins with this measure against those who file and then going to the pub to take a coffee in working hours. 
This novelty has been presented today by Minister of public administration, Renato Brunetta and by the secretary general of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi. 
"The automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services," the minister. 
"Now it opens a new season of responsibility and transparency. 
This is, "highlights again reformism Brunetta. 
With Palacio Chigi completes the installation in all the buildings of the presidency of the Council. 
For Masi "the choice of the automatic doors is also important from the point of view symbolic". 
It has not been found resistance on the part of employees, ensures the Secretary-General: "has been a change shared by workers and was collaboration on the part of the same". 
In short, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and medialunas. 
Word of Brunetta, which suggests, smiling, "a good capuchino at 7 o'clock in the morning is a hand Santa". 
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration. 
In Rome, the minister declares that "in three months the absences for diseases of public employees have been reduced by 50%, mean 60 thousand people more to work in a year." 
And he adds that it is necessary to pay more effective public administration 
Italian, "which wage dynamics – explains the Minister – in the past 10 years have been double with regard to the private sector and well above the Taso of inflation". 
By now, millions of public employees have joined together to oppose the provisions of the decree Brunetta sticking to the petition supported by CODACONS. 
"While the minister of public role shows the numbers, the absence of minor work for causes of disease – writes the Association of consumadores – the people of the" vague "workers is increasing. 
Indeed, in Italy are million employees of public administration correct and productive who have joined together to declare war on the rules ilegitimas of the decree ". 
In particular, in the tar you answer the exclusion of economic aggregates treatments for disease due to cause of service; the extension of the fajas timings in which they perform visits of medical supervision of the employee sick, and other aspects contained in the new provisions treasured by the minister. 
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "crucial" prevention 
Every day, in Italy, was tested in the workplace accidents, die 3 500 people and 27 are permanently maimed. 
For 2007, the data Inail confirm that White deaths have been roughly 1,200. 
Figures indicate the seriousness of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death, and almost double the causes of deaths in relation to the murder. 
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and means of information about this dramatic issue, today the Anmil held in all of the provinces of Italy, the 58° national day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized in the second Sunday in October. 
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news these days confirms the crucial is the issue of prevention in the workplace," says the president of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, the message sent to the President of the National Association Anmil, maimed and disabled by the work, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of the state exprime his "great appreciation for the constant voluntary efforts in favour of prevention in the workplace, the protection of workers injured, assistance to the families of the victims and public awareness". 
"They said, 'enough', a genuinely shared, pits tragedies that, by its dimensions, raise the clamour of the media and the involvement of the public, instead of the daily reality proposes tragic cases, even repeated in its dynamic." 
Napolitano not hiding that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information. 
Particular meaning take the numerous initiatives promoted in school level for a more direct awareness of part of the young people who enter the world of work. 
It is a duty to keep alive the attention to the phenomenon, not curb the alarm about the serious social, implement and enhance the legislative rules. 
For its part, the chairman of the house Gianfranco Fini has stressed "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitute an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all institutions a determined effort to put an end to" urgently. 
"The data on accidents at work seem to point to a slight andamiento positive, but this does not alter the fact that the number of deaths is equally impressive," White has pinpointed the President of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We do not want, indeed, that this" trend decline "translates into less attention, because it is precisely when the alertness that exploits the tragedy. 
"We believe that general level is still too little to compare the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy may be put into practice through multiple actions. 
They are necessary, our criterion - has highlighted Mercandelli – more checks and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school. " 
"serves a further effort - has added - as concerns the communication and public awareness. 
But, above all, is a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers regarding a phenomenon that represents a social emergency. " 
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary protection scheduled for victims of the work" and "drifting towards the benefits which the system is leading in recent years". 
"The aim is to restore the worker guarantee the safe - has added – because the fate of accidental who does not have to rely on the largess prepared by the legislator ever". 
Readers MP3 under accused, put at risk the hearing 
Listen to music at high volume for a long period of time using portable music devices like MP3 readers can cause permanent damage to the hearing. 
The European Commission is concerned that, in a statement issued in Bruxel cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today. 
"This scientific opinion – you read the note – arises that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least five years, hear music with portable music devices weekly for more than an hour a day taking the apparatus at high volume risk losing a permanent hearing ability". 
"I worry about the fact that a number of young people so high that often use portable music devices and mobile phones to acoustic level high can ruin unconsciously their ears in a hopeless," says Meglena Kuneva. 
"The scientific evidence – remains the responsibility EU emerges - a clear risk and must react quickly. 
What counts is to raise the consumadores and pay this information in the public domain. 
We must re examine, in addition to the existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, to be widely effective and have the pace with new technology. " 
Bruxel had asked the independent scientific committee to examine the problem, seeing the great use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise that creates. 
"Scientists - concludes the EU executive – confirm that is cause for concern and the European Commission now examine together with Member States and stakeholders that could eventually adopt measures to better protect children and teenagers from exposure to noise from portable music devices and related equipment". 
Currently, there is already a European security rule that limits to 100 DB the level of noise of portable music devices, but concern increases as the auditory damage that can lead to excessive exposure to such sources of noise. 
It is possible to limit damage resorting to a lot of these solutions such as reducing levels and the length of time of exposure to noise. 
In his view, the EU Scientific Committee does present that users of portable music devices listen to high volume of 89 decibeles (MAS) music by only 5 hours per week exceed the limit currently in force concerning the maximum noise acquiesced in the workplace. 
Those who hear music in such conditions for prolonged periods Mas, risk losing a permanent hearing ability after a period of five years. 
It means that affects the 5-10% of users of such devices and the number may be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU. 
Rome, Alemanno gives the path to the Commission on the future of the capital 
Opens today in March, closes in June will be the accounts. 
This is the timetable for the city and for workers "Commission for the future of the city of Rome," which has taken place this morning in his new seat behind the Termas of Caracalla. 
In six months, President Antonio Marzano, and the other 49 components of the Commission deliberaran the key points to Rome. 
Once closed doors in March, the board and council out-turn communal analysis and projects, at present in June the strategic piano to Rome with the "official" bollo municipality and its intendente Gianni Alemanno. 
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all the political, social and cultural ideas – tends to emphasize Alemanno – should provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the City Council, will then be endorsed. 
There is no spare position of roles, only the willingness of having a place where produce a great project for Rome. 
Finished in March jobs will disappear, because this experience must have a temporary ends. 
In June – heralds the intendente – presenting the strategic plan using the work of the Commission on the future of the capital of Rome. " 
Who accused the commission of futile, given that its opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that will be in the degree of the Commission and the quality of their proposals. 
If the quality will be present, as well as in France with the Commission Attali and as I am sure in Rome, his contribution will be essential. 
Politics is almost always seal in the day-to-day management and in emergencies that back in round are demonstrating. 
We, on the contrary, we want to look beyond and long-term vision, in a more profound, working with seriousness to the development of Rome and its future ". 
The intendente of Rome tends to also point out that "this Commission is neither a useless body or a truism: it is absolutely free coastal, not a euro Roman citizens and serve to participate and reasoning, the best minds that exprime Capital." 
For Alemanno, effectively, "it needs a strategic design as a reference, not closed or hovering, in order to enable our city to make a genuine leap of level, of which we have absolute necessity, thinking with unitary spirit to its future". 
A future that requires the intendente of Rome "is not limited only to the current communal corners but to look beyond" not only in the light of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and must function as capital of Europe and the Mediterranean." 
Does Obama? The first president anti American. 
He wrote a note American politician who cares undergo independent: "Barack Obama will be the second president anti-Americano. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, with its decisions reduced the economy uses and tube relations (as does today also gives private citizen) with the enemy of Islam ". 
Increasing attacks against Obama as the date of the elections. 
He has written a lady of Miami in a website: "This person is full of ambitions. 
Obama has a large stone face: believes that won the post more high of the nation that has had two black governors and five senators! " 
In reality are attacks that does not say much; they are clearly attacks of racial nature and not respond to the question of voters: It will be a good President? And are also the polls; all say that Obama won and with a good advantage. 
Also in this case there is who speaks with the heart but not the brain. 
A newspaper of the Mississippi, in the bowels of South America, has written an editorial: once in the cockpit to vote know well who give their vote the American patriot. 
Only one side of the American mentality taken covered until the last. 
"Whatever we want, we shall see then where to put the cross, whether about Obama or McCain." 
There are people who Jura: If Obama comes to win, we shall of America. 
These things never before now, which seems almost certain the success of a black candidate. 
However, despite all these considerations, the weapon for the Democratic winner is George Bush. 
1500 people have asked: What were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? The 89 percent replied: Iraq. 
Change America. 
In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and sent home to kicked in the backyard. 
In Iraq are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to make the bags. 
Similarly, Iraq for the majority has been the weak point of Bush. 
Who will assume the post of George W will have a huge responsibility that function. 
Uses, economic collapse is also feel for journalists: in newspapers is time of blackouts. Many Dan blame on the Internet, "Killer" of the printed paper. 
Five hundred American journalists have been concerned by Pew Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control for the future. 
Although today, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future. 
However, journalists have not declared openly feel less concerned about credibility. 
They do not feel isolated as once. 
The problem for American journalists is money, the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of economic model destroyed. 
In addition to the cuts made in the room where the writers work for the newspaper, is a major problem. 
It is a problem that must be resolved, according to Reporters interviewed, if not want traditional journalism as it understands the majority of the public is substantially reduced. 
A clear but complex pessimism dominates today on the American journalist. 
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at national level this following the wrong way. 
In the local area the group executive is 65%. 
Printed against. 
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the Web. 
The largest publishing houses are opened a gap on the Internet, for many view as the "murderer" letter printed. 
The "economic pressure" journalists warn has risen to a 79%. 
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that something good "for journalism. 
Breaking the mas grande today in American journalism is among those who directs newspapers – or whether the directors – and journalists who work for them. 
56% of executives at the national level is certain that its journalists share the same values, while at local level the low percentage to 23%. 
For some of this has to do with the "safety of work". 
Executives who think losing the job in 3 years are 47% nationally. 
For the journalistic staff is 30%. 
The work of the "safe" level staff (our editors, NDR) in America is always on the agenda. 
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract. 
In a vast nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet employers often offer what they want and becomes a matter of "Take it or leave it,". 
The directors are almost always good salaries, while the authors can earn up to 10 thousand dollars a month, Mas retirement and social insurance. 
For the holidays, the reasoning is complicated: a total of days after the first year, another of the third to reach 15 days complete after a certain number of years. 
But journalists Americans, by their own admission, "contract" followed during the year. 
It is all a matter of climate. 
Unipol: court of Rome, Danilo Coppola is in Grottaferrata 
The president of the second section of the criminal court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the resort property of Danilo Coppola who had asked to move their city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome. 
Coppola this investigated by bankruptcy in the field of research on the pact against concerning the escalation Unipol-Bnl. 
In the course of the process of arrest at his office last week, has gained the release home, transforming it into compulsory residence to Grottaferrata. 
His lawyer, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the property can go the route of the city of the province until a room of the capital. 
According to the court, these trips (for which the PMS has given vote contrary) would allow him to influence its society and access to the evidence that accuse him. 
The elites endangered 
The phenomenon was already said a few days ago with the vote of the camera representatives against the plan of salvation of 700 million dollars set in motion by the White House: a significant proportion of Americans age, and this, more interested to punish Wall Street to save the economy. 
Gives us a confirms the New York Times yesterday informing us that the ongoing crisis is unraveling the Republican Party, always more divided between his old soul of the East Coast, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions and the business community, and his new soul, in contrast, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington and the world of finance, particularly strong in the States of the centre and the South. 
The soul, in fact, that has become increasingly high-handed with the vote of those who spoke at the outset. 
This barely mentioned is just one example of mutations, the large mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake advertises: not only in the United States but across the West, and not only here only. 
It is in the United States and Europe have long since the crisis seems to function as accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidifican and go to light. 
The first of these phenomena is re update, the extraordinary revival, the double category estado-soberanía in relation to a kind of re nationalisation of the economy. 
The crisis, it is indeed a crisis of banking institutions - which are funded, if financiarías strong relations with the outside world, but especially are committed much more balance sheets of families who live in one country and in a single state. 
That creates immediately a political problem for whom the rules: i.e. how to respond to the difficulty and the protests of those people and of those families, on the other hand are voters. 
The crisis is global, but is politically and economically exclusively national. 
The political internationalism seems substantially outside game or do not have much to say: the crucial test is the European Union as divided as ever between the various interests and the different state strategies is not decide no common policy. 
Is the government of each state that all expect a intervention, plans to rescue and recovery of new rules and especially the subsidy of funds: from the moment that it reaches the court is only the state that holds the economic resources and the supply of resources to finance yourselves to remedy things. 
And also possess the necessary means and the legitimation to use them: two priceless resource, values in certain circumstances on which any market probably will never have any organization, and in the same measure. 
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the nation state is in perfect harmony with the utmost importance whenever the new development of the economy tends to give him a very coligado factor to this element: the territoriality. 
Paradoxically, while we were convinced have entered the network technology ever more sophisticated, immaterial, while we were convinced that the global finance was already designed to dominate the world, we noticed that our future will instead make ever more accounts with little intangible things like water, crops and oil. 
All things that look, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but United are equally at all in a confined space, a territory. 
So who is as sovereign, has certainly many more letters regarding who is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a post without crops, without oil and without water. 
That brings me to the second novelty but foreshadows a fracture. 
Who says territory, state government, inevitably says policy and leadership. 
In this sense, the economic crisis appears to produce two phenomena convergent. 
On the one hand the objective awareness of the need for a leadership, the request of one who knows take in hand the situation. 
On the other hand a wavelength discredit to the existing helm, sort of economic relevada inadequate with many grey areas. 
And together, something more profound and in a certain sense unsettling: a discredited, intolerance, an image inadequate, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the whole of the establishment of the countries of the West in increasing numbers. 
Always seems to move more in various parts of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites until now booming, felt the same way and be, its culture in the exception understanding of the end, have made their own time and be more strange to the views of the majority. 
The demand for leadership, in short, subterráneamente feeds a movement more ramified but powerful delegitimisation of the ruling classes and the traditional political structures, which are in a "riot" or sudden changes in the election of collective whims of recent times, since the conservative Austria-Baviera exit in the collapse of the social-democrático consensus in Britain, the rebellion of men of the American Congress against Bush (layers and also with the victory of the right in Italy, which has something to do). 
One has the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also its rites, its newspapers, their intellectual accredited, its format say any, always make it more difficult to understand and then to represent, what right now that is taking shape are profound strata of Western society and that the economic crisis, renewed and potentially stirs in overgrown. 
To cope with all this talk of a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exaggerated. 
But having the eyes open certainly is not. 
The super glue to walk on the walls 
Overcoming the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in a future walk on the walls as the man filing. 
It is the target of several American research centres and now a team of four institutes was close enough. 
With a badge of only 2.5 square centimetres scientists have been able to have brought a body of 100 kg on a vertical wall. 
The study – the American magazine has published science discoveries of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of the existing structure that use a particular carbon, so-called carbon nanotube. 
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a pile of spaghetti" explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
Scientists have been inspired to the leg of the gecos, overlaid please minuscule of hair that can ensure adherence to the animal a perfect. 
The test facts on different materials like glass, teflón and role of Lija, have shown that the new mailbox is ten times more potent than the legs of this reptil and at the same time, "easily diverges from the walls" explains Liming Dai, investigator empowers the engineering of the University of Dayton. 
Walk the walls? -- "this material could be useful as a mailbox transitional adds Liming Dai. 
Layers to walk the walls exactly as the man trap? Layers, yes, but researchers think a use much less fascinating as the connection between electronic equipment, because carbon nanotubes are drivers heat and electricity. 
Other applications might have to do with the aerospace engineering. 
For the moment, nothing superhéroes. 
Another research - also the University of Berkeley, California, is devoted to the pursuit of a new mailbox. 
In an article for the journal American chemicals – society, scholars Californians have presented a mailbox fact micro fibers like ECU 8m which car empty of dust during the movement on a surface to maintain provided a perfect adherence. 
Drugs: never with exuberance fruit 
Attention to the exuberance pomelo, in orange and apple juice. 
These drinks, implemented especially in summer because they are referred to and rich in vitamins, if you take contemporáneamente with some drugs it alters its absorption amplifying or declining, according to the case, efficiency with serious consequences for health. 
To repeat the risk of toys that fresh fruit are packaged associated with the assumption of medicinal some David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, since the 236esimo national meeting of the American chemicals – society underway at Philadelphia sends a new alarm: just a glass of exuberance pomelo, orange and apple to reduce the absorbimiento of some drugs, cancelling the beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients. 
The exuberance pomelo was already under indictment was withheld because state responsible for up to toxic levels some arrítmicos anti medicinal, antibiotics, ansiolíticos, antihistamínicos and neurologically. 
FARMACOS risks – the same Italian agency of the drug had given the news in a bulletin of reports two years ago alarmando doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger that flow from this mixture and attention to something you drink in the case is taking a drug like, for example, to Diasepam or Metadone. 
Not only the pomelo – according to experts also exuberance of orange and apple contain chemicals that inhibit the drugs. 
A long list of principles assets inhibited by the Pomelo and other Jugos. 
From here the so-called of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milano: "These findings in general has indicated to the various agencies of national and international drug that eventually provide information to change the notes of the same. 
We must therefore always read the leaflets illustrative of medicinal products that are taking and if there is something that we have no clear, not to impress us, clearly ask the doctor or pharmacist 'expert stressed the agency ANSA. 
The novel of economy to Paul Krugman 
The Nobel Prize in economics has been allocated to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, their trade patterns and on the location of economic activity. 
Krugman, 55, is a Keynesian Neo who teaches at Princeton University and feel is an editorial writer for The New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the decisions of the Bush administration on the economy and foreign policy. 
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, in those days Che quebraba Enron, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second serious event more decisive than the first, in termines of consequence to the United States. 
A forecast that desencadeno much controversy and that for several years reprochada wine to the economy, but that has now been revealed accurate. 
"I am surprised, and a little bit annoyed by the memory of the scandal of the collapse of Enron and WorldCom have disappeared quickly from the attention of the public", had declared Krugman to fine the 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the executive board of the European Central Bank economist, Krugman is a "great courage", but also a divulgador style with a "very aggressive, particularly critical against the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration ’. 
Open Office, ECHO the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft ’ 
It is the day of the launch of the OpenOffice. Said 3.0, open personal productivity suite that always looking to attract more softly-softly manner, from the House to the office to the professionals of public administration, as an alternative to the well-known free Microsoft Office. 
After a work of almost a year of part of developers volunteers, of whom their backs are overseen by Sun Microsystems, the new office is open to the public, with several developments: the welcome screen and interface magazine less rude, they add other more consistent, as the compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new format ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the last version ISO standard. 
Attention also to the implementation by Multi operation with the suite Office 2007, open office is in degree of open documents with the new extension of Microsoft (. Docx. Xlsx. Pptx). 
Interesting some specific functions of some modules as that which makes it possible to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation of useful, for example, to send it via electronic fun, or the possibility of importing the PDF file in the processing Modulo Grafica, while preserving the original aspect of the page. 
Always on this front can create PDF documents "hybrid" Grafica accumulate the typical of the format of Adobe with elements of a road or of a winemaker calculation of text. 
Cooperation is an element which has received various improvements in the interior of the aplicativos: on the road calculation may intervene in various users, avoiding conflicts of the modificas, in the preparation of texts, each collaborator has given a colour in the programming for a better recognition in the phase of revision. 
Some companies are also working to bring some functions of OpenOffice on the Web (on the cloud, above the clouds), and in the coming weeks should provide the ultimate outcome. 
The Italian version can be downloaded in the direction at http: / / it.openoffice.org/download/3,0.0/download300. HTML and I would add to the English that was in the mirror since Friday. 
Moreover, for Windows and Mac OS, as normally the suite is also available for the Linux operating system. 
Asked can be sent to the CD of installation at home or at work. 
And if the issue of the free may be a hook to spread in houses, is in the area of business that Open Office suite test, tries to the big bet, can now count on several projects undertaken in public administration and in schools. 
And there is no shortage of even the realities that offer a service of training, consultations and ideal assistance to small- and medium-sized enterprises, which could open prospectivas of business. 
Open office consists of five main modules: writer, for the video for writing the word; Calc, is the road calculation that replaces; impress Excel spreadsheet for the presentation of PowerPoint; dBASE, as in the case of the well-known access is the program that consent to work within the dates basis; and finally draw the grafico Modulo. 
The goal for 2008 is reaching 5 million download, and considering that until now we reached almost 3 million already 600 thousand, with the departure of the new version is likely to be overcome the target figure. 
Kohl is also positive is the fourth case of anti-doping 
New case positive in the Tour de France: the Austrian Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, third classified and winner of the best remera of the escalador. 
Give the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe. 
Kohl, 26 years is the fourth positive corridor to the third-generation EPO after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, the Gerolsteiner them. 
The analysis of the champions of blood of Kohl fall between those made in recent weeks in the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratory. 
If the against tests confirm that is positive, the Austrian lost the third seat on the tour and rage against the two years of canónica disqualification. 
To confirm the news of doping positive Kohl the third-generation EPO is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, which has declared the Associated Press have reported the news to the Austrian authorities. 
The Austrian 26 years has been placed on the podium at the expense of Spaniard Carlos tailor and the American Cadel Evans, selling the remera of the best escalador. 
Immigrants: New York Times wonders, Italy is racist? 
Italy is a country of immigrants has been transformed only recently in a privileged destination for immigrants "met with hostility. 
This is transforming the country beautiful in a nation of racists? Is the question that the New York Times in a long article that has devoted to the debate on the issue of racism in Italy on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed the previous month in Milan for having stolen a box of galletitas. 
This case highlights what the New York Times defines the North "paradox": Northern regions are at the same time those where you register "more integration and more work" but also the most high anti-inmigrantes sentiment in the country and the more senior who the Northern League ". 
As confirms the growing tension between Italians and immigrants in the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
Not only. 
The new legislation also loved by the Lega the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as the paradigm of the cambiamiento climate in Italy. 
Trend is marked by the pope that by President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, finding: "Benedetto XVI in Congress has asked that the state and the church to work together to combat racism". 
Students victims of the expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room 
The rental market for the college knows no crisis. 
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the Union of the individual tenants, renting a room can cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 to Napoles, 600 to Rome. 
"The phenomenon has taken already features very serious to the point of excluding the right to study a large proportion of young people by the soaring costs that the family would sustain – explains the responsibility of the office studies of the Sunia, Laura Mariani – in these cities the strong demand has completely distorted the market at this point to unleash a process of widespread increase until for residents". 
In part that in most cases the offerings of rents contain a series of violations: contracts type free, not registered, without limit of Canon, sub rents linked. 
Sunia are necessary for extraordinary interventions that, through the review of taxation, to regulate prices. 
Looking in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, on a bed in Brianza zone, serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (area Nere Bande) at an average value of 800 (area, and Lambiate Udine beast) to a maximum of 900 victory (in part). 
In Florence a bed costs on average of 350/400 euros, in a room approximately 700. 
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas near the University, serve 250/280 euros for a double bed in a room and 370 500 by an individual. 
In Rome in central areas near the University (Plaza San Lorenzo, Bologna) you call approximately 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a double bed in a room. 
Only slightly more low values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
It makes the economy only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina area, Centocelle and vicinity. 
In Naples on a bed you serve 300/450 euros, for a room spent from 400 to 600 euros, with prices more high in the areas Policlínico Vomero, and Aminei Colli. 
In Bari on a bed you serve 250/350 euro, at least 350 by an individual. 
In cities more girls are more low prices in termines absolute, but has a greater weight in the economy of the city. 
In cities like in Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to non-EU students and is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: an increase in the 25/30% of Canon to foreign students about Italians. 
Goodbye to the old Cinema Paradiso, cities cancelled historical halls 
Rooms historical film close favouring the multiplex. 
"a city without cinema halls in a city blind, is like a face without eyes." 
The picture offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore fotógrafa effectively with what is happening in the big urban centers Italians and also in the cities of province. 
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth of the great meticones in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the monkey rooms in central areas of the city, is an inevitable event and undisputed with all the characteristics of a real cultural crime. 
To disappear almost always are historic places, full of memory, "it is as if died a friend, a well-known with which it shared a slice of place and so much emotion", observes the director of the new Cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago back earn the cousin Oscar and the grand jury prize at Cannes, which had the poetry of a cinema of province and nostalgia for the way of living cinema that lost perhaps forever. 
The figures given by the ANEC, the main association of traders, speak clear: in the last five years have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay the bulk are sobretodos chambers of the major cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Napoles, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
Among the regions more suffered by the closures are as first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas less, following by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41). 
It is a demonstration that the responsible for its disappearance is the avenimiento the multiplex, are own these three Italian regions that have done registering the largest number of new cinemas meticones 195 screens: Mas in Lombardia in the past five years, 81 in Tuscany in Emilia-Romagna. 
"The Italian exercise has been developed irrationally" notes Paolo Protti, president of the ANEC, "it would be useful to assure New structures but would be required to ensure the permanence of those that already exist, because when a crowded city closes, not all their frecuentadores are willing to be transferred to the meticones. 
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the debt before the state is approximately 10 million euros. 
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect the laws that exist. 
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year. 
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that worried by the closures, decided to be repaired with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and ANEC, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the monkey cinema hall is in the historic centre in the periphery. 
Among the rules exist fiscal facilitation mediated in favour of managers and advantages for the public in termines mobility: viewers will be able to enter the area traffic will be limited and special tariffs for the deployment. 
"It is an initiative that I love notes Giuseppe Tornatore ’" and I hope that other cities to follow the example of Bologna putting up other measures. 
It is true that contrasts the extra power of the meticones traditional rooms, the need to improve the quality of the sound and image because the public is now more demanding. 
The defense of the traditional film is a topic which for me was always important: the closure of the cinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "new" Cinema Paradiso, already thought from 10 years ago. 
I live in Rome from 25 years ago, and when one step ahead of the Rialto or at the Quirinale of Alleanza route already closed, where I have lived many shared emotions, not to see the cartels ennegrecidos by the dust, I turn to the other side ”. 
Bond between politics and 'Ndrangheta, has been arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro 
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize County elections for those interested in the cosca Piromalli." 
The acusas that are heavy magistrates of the Antimafia Directorate of Calabria give the intendente and vice intendente of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione rosary and Schiavone, and intendente of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by Mafia association. 
Also arrested Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administration, and her grandson lawyer, opposite number of Boss shops, already condemned by Mafia criminal association and to compensate for 10 million euros. 
"Regardless of any moral and legal norms, and good sense," write prosecutors, the two local authorities had expressed willingness to pay consultations at the lawyer Piromalli. 
"It would have been allowed to write Mafia family – the judges - officially enter the internal municipality, providing a great possibility of command and control of public administration". 
The president of the regional board calabrés Agazio Loiero not hiding "agreements between the bad organised life is a lot" in its region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable. 
But there are many local politicians to resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta, heroes who stays clean. " 
The arrested this morning we add to those last July after the police had announced the court of heads of Piromalli Mafia family. 
Since the end of last April, the city council of Gioia Tauro had dissolved, as in 1991 and always for alleged conditions between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been solevados the task of managing the municipality. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, intendente, UDC at the time of the dissolution, after the balotaje in May 2006, had been elected as head of a centre-right coalition. 
Exploto a scandal when the prefecture ordeno the dissolution of the municipal council. 
Call in case the deputy minister of the Interior, which at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organised by a political issue, but the judges in order to arrest signed this morning to explain that Piromalli had come to ask the variation of the project of the Highway A3. 
The ambienta intercepting them made at Dal Torrione, write judges emerges, "the availability to favour the demands of an employer, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniformando elections of public administration on the interests of the Mafia families." 
When energy is born of waves, fall to the stage the great 
This is a field that has wiped out more than 70% of the surface of the planet and are now discovering, the big global energy companies. 
Waves and currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which look great as Chevron. 
The chance to collect energy of movements of the sea is studying for a hundred years ago, and in the 1970s along with the first oil crisis, investigations into high gear. 
When the price of oil under, in 1980, the idea of harnessing energy was separate from the Navy, but now that cases of environment and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) for the 2007 London has estimated that 15% of the world's electric need could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of waves of the sea. 
This amount would be double the currently produced by nuclear power stations. 
And would be tides and currents. 
The Giants attack. 
The first company to bet on the marine energy has been ENERSIS, 2005 has sealed a deal to build an implant in northern Portugal. 
When the intention was announced seemed a step revolutionary. 
Two years away to bet on the marine energy are always more and between these companies that have always voted for the traditional energy. 
"Chevron is studying technology on the ocean energy – has declared the spokesman of a company associated with the oil giant has the American economic newspaper Wall Street Journal – and is weighing the possibility of cooperating with us". 
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the Commission for American energy, to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska. 
It is a very important signal, if one considers that in Alaska the US continue to extract oil and recently the President Bush has activated a plan for new drilling. 
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and New Jersey ocean power to follow the path of the energy that comes from the sea, the total invested until now, although they are not detailed show an interest in the increase. 
Technology to develop. 
The experts speak of a technology still at the beginning, because the marine energy, there is no doubt that has a great environmental impact. 
By now the impacts such as those Portuguese or the Scots are small size and do not seem to create big problems for the ecosystem. 
To produce energy to large scale, you should use a technology with a greater environmental impact. 
And the choices are several: Ocean power, for example, uses a system of United boas between them. 
The force of the waves, which makes the boas move upwards or downwards becomes pressure with percussion and hydraulic cylinders at the home. 
The pressure is turning a turbina which in turn feeds a generator. 
Electricity is sent to the coast through undersea cables. 
For now they are four such implants developing waiting only for federal approval, part of the energy, could serve for a military installation. 
Verdant Power, by contrast, already produces energy for a commercial centre and for a parking, using underwater turbines in the East River in New York. 
The movement of water when there are tides, turning the paletas of the turbines, creating a movement giratorio that feeds the generator. 
Verdant has said that has a long list of customers waiting for authorisations necessary to use energy. 
After the waves, tides. 
A particular interest, say in the Institute for the development of electrical energy, Merita at this moment the potential of the tides. 
While there is an intermittent phenomenon, the tides are more preventable that the sun or wind, waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy. 
It is, above all, about the energy of the tides that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others who are closer to the coast, have invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and planned a reversal of 35 million for 2009.
