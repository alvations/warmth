The official estimates showed that 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
Unlike the American central banks, the British, Canadian and European Central Bank (ECB) has not dropped the interest rate cuts by saying that the director of intérets, with price growth of matieres premieres and the unemployment rate was the generation, would lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would keep inflation below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, is the catch 22: "for the ECB to deter" inflation so that we had on this subject was later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 percent is a record in the twelve years causing in Spain, and it went up 3.6 has 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has left because of the rapid increase in food prices and energy.
The ratings grain market has run up 88 percent and the soya has reached its highest value since 1973.

Gallup indicates a government crisis
Apres prolonged stagnation, the number of supporters of the Alliance of Fidesz (Democrats) has increased significantly since 2002. In early December, he now has the largest number of supporters, while polling institute Gallup () has never seen before a weak Socialist support, has also: 13%.
For fideles voters, the difference would represent the greatest determination of opposition voters, support for more than two thirds (71 percent) against the support of a cinquieme (20 percent) for the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP).
According to the survey, the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) and the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent in the whole population.
On the voters fideles certain to vote, the number of supporters of both parties rose by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate compared to the previous low point, the proportion of those who felt that the country's economic situation was serious particulierement all-time high, it has 41% is complementary to 46 percent and the situation is serious enough.
Apres more optimistic prospects last spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their situation was financiere.
For next year, the majority of the population is growing and only a dixieme provides an improvement of the situation.
In December, 71 percent of people polled, a majority has never seen in previous Gallup poll, felt that the Prime Minister did his job rather poorly as well.
13% of those polled have confidence or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38% support Viktor Orbán.
54% do not trust the Prime Minister and the President of 27 percent Fidesz.
A indicators of change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that discontent stands with the Prime Minister can be treated without change in government.
While apres riots in October, 35% of those polled thought that the government and the Prime Minister now remain in office, it represents only 20 percent. The relative majority (33 percent) believe that the elections would be the remedy this situation.
Asked about intend to vote, 60% of those polled say they would certainly vote and the additional 20 percent said they would probably vote.
In comparison, to a "hold" legislative election next Sunday, only 55 percent of those questioned and 15 percent certainly would probably participate. The complementary current intentions, the outcome of the referendum would no doubt.
74% of people would say no to the fees in higher education, 79 percent would not the expense of consultation and 84 percent would say no living has the hospital.
When we look at only the memes proportions among those who have expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of tuition fees for consulting fees and travel costs was the hospital.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco affirms a 20%
The hypermarkets implanted in the commercial triangle of Budaörs have maintained the average price increase of 16 percent of the year derniere was the difference that this year the rate of VAT has not increased.
Order of Gazdaság (Napi daily Economy)
This year, in the triangle of Budaörs trade, the usual Christmas Panier daily also grew 16 percent on average, an increase of 1,000 forints much higher value is displayed in all the hypermarkets.
The price, "which had already gone" in the supermarkets in December, no longer has increased sharply over the previous high.
Nevertheless, consumers are naturally shocked to see that the items bought far below nine thousand forints derniere year now sells for more than ten thousand forints.
The Panier in the daily hypermarkets probeds exceeded 91 forints, at least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of 10 573 basket was forints.
(In 2003, it was 6 800 forints.)
The Unicum and the price of fish living remained almost at the level of the year, though the price of derniere turkey net, the nuts and poppy have soared.
In the shops, flour and bread followed the data from the Central Statistics Institute of KSH (Auchan) but, were found in a kilo bread has 139 forints only.
Competition has not dropped the price below 200 forints.
It was amazing, also in the hypermarket, the price of a bottle of Coke recorded two litres was below 200 forints, forints coutait, 257 including recorded the bottle.
It is empeche that this year, in terms of daily Auchan Panier, was the most expensive and Cora cheapest.
The apres our calculations, Cora has increased the price of its daily Panier of 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan respectively have risen by about 18 and 18 percent.
Comparing the basket as much of the year derniere and the cheapest basket of this year, we see a gap of 12% while the difference between the cheaper derniere year and the most expensive of this year is 21 percent.
Prices have risen by an average of 1 480 forints.
Last year, derniere prices rose 1 206 forints on average, knowing that the impact of the increase in the rate of VAT was already noted in the price of Christmas last year.
This process has been perplexed trade, the hypermarkets could not determine how much visibly applied on the products until they were unable to predict the impact of change in consumer prices.
(If someone is not the rotation of a product, we risk losing a big profit margin on the line has the intensity of trade.)
Because of the change in the rate of VAT, the prices of daily Panier has evolved from maniere so that the excessive basket was the most expensive 1 720 forints has the value of the 2006 while the difference between the baskets was the cheapest 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so unreasonable because the value of the most expensive basket was superior to 1 630 forints (derniere year and cheaper prices rose 1 284 forints.
In bringing the two Christmas seasons, we have seen a dramatic increase in prices in less than 20 months, the prices of everyday items rose more than 30 percent in the hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirms KSH data for certain foods: first need, the institute of statistics found a price increase of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case with flour and egg.)
According to the daily Panier, it seems almost absurd because the level of price, already well, the year derniere has increased from just over 10 percent of the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers are stronger than the suppliers of eggs because they were able to accept the sharp increase in prices also by the multinationals.
In the golden triangle, the commercial complaining hypermarkets, consistently good years.
From apres our experiences, the majority of customers is more prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take food long-life by palettes.
On Wednesday morning tail of major unions have formed three hypermarkets because the number of customers has risen sharply.
According to our information, the turnover is less important in province, many complain aupres multinational corporations do not even in achieving the anticipated turnover, not only for food but also for the sustainable consumption.
Many hospitals are the economy on disinfectants
This year, more than 1,000 infections, caused mainly by the misuse of antibiotics, were registered in hospitals.
The sanitary conditions, the insufficient number of hospital beds and overwork medical staff has not helping block infections, says the chief medical officer of the National Centre epidemiology.
Many hospitals are also the economy on disinfectants
It is no longer a MRSA infection was diagnosed in hospital traumatology János.
The antibiotic resistant bacteria was detected on a man hospitalised result was a serious accident.
The patient has been isolated.
Earlier this year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The wounded a serious car accident left the hospital but little time he has the apres back because of a MRSA infection, doctors have not been able to make a significant operation because of the bacterium in his body.
Up to 10 December this year, 1 094 hospitalieres infections generated by a pathogene officer multirésistant were declared the national Systeme hospital-acquired surveillance, said Karolina Böröcz, chief medical officer of the National Centre epidemiology.
I know that this is the number of infections caused by a multirésistant pathogene agent who has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two thirds of infection (683 infections) were caused by the MRSA, i.e. staphylococcus aureus resistant by the méthicilline-oxacilline.
A third of the people are carriers of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (SA) of their noses without developing a disease.
The infection caused by the SA (such as anginae, amygdalites, skin infections, traumatic infections) are responding to antibiotics, they are easily cured.
However, if the excessive use of antibiotics or inappropriate, maniere bacteria, which responds well to antibiotics, develop an antibiotic resistant bacteria, which proliférera quickly in the hospitalieres conditions.
In case of malfunctioning immune systeme or extended the interim, the bacterium can cause serious infections, such as a hospitalieres or a traumatic infection septicemia, on older patients, small or having a weakened body weight.
According to the director of the hospital doctor János, there is nothing special in the MRSA infections, these injuries are part of the everyday life of hospitals.
We must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, there is not only the MRSA or they are not trying, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The SA are resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, carers puts rubber gloves and protective masks and antibiotics adapted to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
At first glance, patients are considered whether they are carriers of MRSA infection, however, cannot always be avoided.
The prélevement of the sample is not the way
The vast majority of infection caused by the MRSA could be prevented but conditions and circumstances are not good, in Hungarian hospitals, to prevent the development and the spread of multi-resistant disease-causing agents, says Karolina pathogenes Böröcz.
As the infection are particularly evident in the hospitals and homes for elderly people, hospitals should monitor patients and isolate patients carrying MRSA immediately.
But prélevement is not the microbiological has become fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
We must know that the national social security fund does not finance these tests.
While most of the day is that if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief doctor epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strict recommendations was the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and Hungarian directives also exists for curing some infection and syndromes.
We must make efforts to be targeted antibiotic therapy, i.e. microbiological examinations should be made to empecher resistance to drugs but hospitals are not always account.
The realization of microbiological prélevements is even more rare in outpatient care and basic care, Karolina told Böröcz.
Many hospitals are the economy on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that the patient MRSA proliferent has another most often by medical personnel.
It is therefore important to wash their hands, putting gloves and protective masks. But serious shortcomings are detected in hospitals in this area.
The MRSA proliferent by mosquito-borne infection and by inhaling droplets. However, contact under the circumstances in Hungarian hospitals, the patient infected cannot always be isolated.
Moreover, the rooms are often filled, are often too affirms each other while in terms of disease, patients should be very different from 1.5 metres to a minimum.
Unfortunately, we also note that hospitals in financiere difficult situation, cut back on disinfectants, they are infirmieres, patients are many, and the risk of contamination is even greater, Karolina Böröcz said.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is lower than maniere detectable or when the proliferation of Agent pathogene may be blocked.
An MRSA against the government
The treatment of MRSA infection exorbitant expenses for social security funds, that is why we fight against this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to figures, it is efficient and MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reveals among its priorities the prevention of the impact of multi-resistant disease-causing agents MRSA pathogenes (as well) and prevent infections caused by these hospitalieres pathogenes agents.

Sofia, the capital, also offers opportunities attractive, areas of shops and offices are promising the depreciation rate higher.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradise in Europe and thus be a priority destination, apres winter and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
Investors already buy more vigilant in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people are buying a building in Bulgaria in even time has changed their lives, their way of life.
Most of the buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and Romania.

Fodor and the Hungarian 6%
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Water, professional meetings, yet achevent Tuesday, Wednesday, apres, the official opening of negotiations on the international climate system apres 2012 will continue.
The experts and politicians arriving from 192 countries around the world will talk about the Roadmap of Bali was supposed to define the efforts to apres the period of reducing emissions defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
The discussion was conducted between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States have also stressed that, for the moment, they do not wish to discuss the exact figures, though they were prets has signed an agreement on the until 2020, reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 25 (40 percent compared with 1990.
Another important subject of the conference is to see if developed countries are committed outside reducing emissions, has provided a technological and allocate money to needy countries.
An agreement has been signed on aid has also provided to developing countries.
The aid funds defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a board composed of 16 members probably within the framework of the Global Fund for the Environment of the UN (GEF), sent Piac and Market forced Old Man Profit (Old Man Profit).
The 6% of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Water, confirms the ambition of the EU to keep its role of flagship in the global efforts designed to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The minister explained that the EU has until 2020 would reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases has 20 percent of the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the Agreement "apres 2012," and it was reduced to prete has 30 percent if the other large parts of the world and / or developing countries were prets commitments, also has adapted has their responsibility and their capabilities.

Hungary has pledged to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases is 6 percent compared to the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfil his commitment, recalls the press release of environmental Ministere.
The stakes are high because the international agreement has Bali has long term on climate policy must be implemented within two years, if not the implementation of the agreement would be postponed apres 2012.

Reducing emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the earth over 2 degrees celcius could not be avoided which, according to the scientists, extremement would have serious consequences and irreversible.

The Americans have done a game
The army is embetée because, apart from the videos censored carefully composed and amateur videos, went to the site of shares which also have, for example, the death of soldiers: in propaganda films, somewhat hypocritical, officers did not prevent the loss but they are never the bloody side of the battle.

Political Capital: Hungarian Guard has increased the risk country
The risk analysis of the Political Capital (Risk Division) Analysing Hungarian Guard activity as last asset, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Hungary) Movement for greater increases in many respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "warning of risk," the company says that, in connection with the activities of Hungarian Guard, the greatest risk is that "policy has already aggressive short-term ethnic clashes may occur is exacerbating ethnic tension already exists between the Romany population and not gypsy Hungary ’.
The research institute said that the Hungarian Guard political strategy aimed at creating this situation is likely to be the main reason.
As they say, this is clearly a major shortcomings of Hungarian politicians: "public actors have gone public debate on the matter was Roma representatives of radical political groupings and extremes who have a political strategy based on the dispute between the Gypsies and the Hungarians'.
The problem is aggravated, the normal dialogue becomes impossible, the extremists are strengthened and the arrival of aggressive conflict is more likely, they say.
According to the research institute, under the attention of international Hungarian media and Hungarian Guard activity "has deteriorated significantly in Hungary's image abroad, particularly regarding the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity."
They say that result has greater publicity given the reorganization of radical groups and Hungarian right-wing extremes since the fall of 2006, many organizations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 is giving the name of "self-defense" national association.
"The common feature of these rallies is that they are defined as a civil organisation when they say publicly preparing their members has defence missions (disasters, Defence, protecting order) armed, if necessary, moreover, brandishing the inability of the police, army, of the state," they said.
They pointed out that everything was happening after the method, based on the resentment of society and the political parties, seeks to disguise under a different civilian political ambitions.
The emphasis on civilian status and the caractere association that serves only to avoid the legal pieges of the registration of these associations in court but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activities of the Hungarian Guard is also a factor that increases the risk of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries cite Hungarian Guard as a potential source of danger and political actors ultranationalists of some neighboring countries to justify their anti-Hungarian policy has illustrated the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influence political stability in the region, "they said.
According to the research institute, the Hungarian Guard constitution is not a single phénomene in East Central Europe, the political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, has the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in asset 2007.
The troubles of Roma that have occurred in a district of Sofia (Kraszna (Poljana) are the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
By taking advantage of these events, the BNU decided to establish a guard by saying that the objective of the organization is "national self-defense."
According to them, these 17 years causing, "Gypsies have terrorized" Bulgaria but the state remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They said that the initiative had considerable discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement of Bulgarian Roma organisations concerning the establishment of their own custody by way of resistance would increase the risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude the Hungarian Roma react in the same threat maniere by holding their own self-defence, according to the warning of risk of Political Capital.
At the request of information to the agency, Attila Juhász telegraph, research director of Political Capital, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their analysis of risk is published every year and if the events occurred that could have an impact on the change of risk, they inform the public, as in the case by issuing a warning of risk.
The fete is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the Act defines exactly the days of fete and, around the fetes, he became aware of reorganizing the working days before the number will fall next year.
The fetes differ in the EU and the US.
The Hungarian legislation fete distinguishes the days of national and state and the rest days.
The rest days are often associated with religious fetes or significant historical events.
In Hungary, we fetons the new year, the last day of the year, which ends and the first day of the new year are also the last days of rest even more so that the réveillonneurs could rest quietly.
Moreover, in a year, we have 11 fetes marked in red.
On 15 March is a national fete in memory of the revolution of 1848, such as the October 23, which is the day to commemorate the 1956 revolution.
On 20 asset, we fetons the constitution of our state, May 1 is the fete of work and on 1 and 2 November, we remember the members of our family and our friends died.
Moreover, we have two days has Easter and Christmas has the Pentecostal.
The days of our state fetes national, religious or rarely falling on a weekend, according to the timetable, he became aware of reorganizing the working days in the case, or there is only one working day before or the fete marked in red apres.
It is true that we are paying the price of the weekend or extended by working on Saturday's school before the weekend extended.
For many years, the minister of labour statue in a particuliere regulation on the days of days before or after the fetes.
The law extends to all employers and their employees, officials and employees on people working in public service.
It does not apply to the service companies, institutions and turn without interruption in service, by their nature, and also for the rest days.
This year, the working days will be modified only around the year-end fetes: (24 December, from private life is virtually across the country because the experiences of most people is overtime or takes a holiday they have saved for these purposes was to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day.
Next year many fetes fall in the middle or the end of the week, then there will be fewer changes in working days has this year.
The first is reorganized schedule around the labour fete to allow workers to stay home of four days.
On Saturday, April 25 will be a day of work for a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is scheduled for Saturday, October 23: 18 October will be a day of work Friday, replacing the 24.
By contrast, next year's end of year ahead of fetes as from 24 December was, everyone will pause non-stop even if the day of the new year falls on Wednesday.

The usual plug into the early morning.
It has a tune, so particuliere has radio: the voice of a violin has which electronic effects are involved.
I ride on her.
The music exchange rate and the low comes to accompany the voices of all the time, was then a female choir comes to join as a real gem.
Mr2 disseminates the song Wings of Love of Zagar.
The Hungarian musical life has long gone bad point with an electronic pop quality.
Now it seems that the plug becomes different if you listen to the new Zagar album.
The emergence of Yonderboi, the few interesting new film born of the digital underground Hungarian slowly has little has changed and the overall picture, despite the new mode of garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian électropop shows that there is anything new under the sun.
Zságer Balázs came to Pécs and he played lui-meme in the Group of Yonderboi before it embarks on its own path, peut-etre because "there is no room for two feet in the shoes' position.
Her project (Zagar) and his music, a combination of jazz, electronic music and dancing began pop, has become known when he took over the composition of soundtracks filmed (For example
The Török Ferenc season).
The training playing early in small clubs began has come at a more general known by when the magazine wan2 quoted their first album of 2002 among the 50 largest Hungarian market disks and declared Yonderboi Zagar, with almost single-handedly, the creators of the Hungarian trend that would be as competitive has the west.
Zagar and his entire undeniably trendy "became" but nobody asked them if they would wear the label.
The group has responded properly, he got a new and better record.
The album entitled Cannot Fly Walk out recently, Instead, can open new paths for them, although the title would represent a continuity with the past has Pécs.
It is that it was a line of the former Pécs group of Balázs Zságer.
We are well with the reference to the flight but has side air music now appears, according to the spirit and the tendency of the time, the impact of the stronger guitar rock and roll.
Ligeti György currently working in England, singer with the group The Puzzle, has shown his talent in these songs during the first album of the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a true chart-topper for radio broadcasting, mr2 Petõfi, since little popular music from morning to night, began has introduced the songs of Wings of Love registered with six Hungarian singers Divas ("Underground").
It is OK to (?).
hvg.hu has raised questions Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: The new hit prompts me has put a question: is your music is still some music layer?
Zságer Balázs: The end of some music layer does not great thing.
For me there are two castes in légere; not mainstream music or underground, no alternative or commercial pop music and music but sincere.
The alternative underground music, can never be made only mediocre and also for sale and become commercial.
But a good pop song also may be sincere.
The attitude of reception also works in this spirit regardless of language or frontieres.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and public what one has your music is more open?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially Western music has more traditional légere.
The, people are going to concerts and not only young people a 10 or 20 years older but also.
They are much more attention to the changes in the music légere because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested to know who and how many people, or listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am glad that people increasingly has our concerts.
But we have never been of music for the market.
For us the music is not made to achieve a goal but for a reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts or mutual influence, but it is already working in the perceived elusive.
However, I have noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you will become more attractive.
hvg.hu: Would you follow the example of Yonderboi accounts?
It works alone and has made carriere rather west.
Zs.B.: We do not really follow his path even if sometimes some are trying to find traces in our music.
We team players who have confidence in the presence of the other and the music are deployed.
Early on, it was inevitable that our music has to be considered Yonderboi because we are several has quit his group and has taken a different path.
hvg.hu mr2: On the palmares of Petõfi, Wings of Love occupies the first place.
Many people have heard the name of first Zagar through this song.
With this style more popular you have opened consciously towards a broader layer?
Zs.B.: We have not planned to sell the tube recordings.
This song means more.
Because of the final for the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed across the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why they – Guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir of the kind.
We have had an idea about choir good soloists of the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was the choir comprising six members (Edina Kutzora: Sena, Judie, Bori, Jay Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi Németh Juci [Neo], who was then named Divas Underground.
hvg.hu: You wanted this song like that or girls have changed somewhat?
Zs.B.: This piece already existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we have made up the album, we thought it was still missing something has this song.
The result of agreements drew the votes of the song.
I have sung the night even the melody that girls have learned later.
I have been almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that the time has galvanized me but sure it took the Divas.
With my voice she would not have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and also I thought that the girls were arriere plan.
There is no solo (was the exception of a solo brief Judy Jay), they have no role only, they sang together and they did not sing louder than the music, the music is not that accompany their song.
They were also derriere on the scene.
Is it wanted?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were the only arriere plan is the technical problemes.
But what was voluntary is that we did not want to play the roles of soloist.
The song also said that we must forget a little our egos or forget just, or, just let these wings, the wings of love, we win.
I also feel that other euphoria that we felt when the music is born.
hvg.hu: Which songs you did the more work?
Zs.B.: Frankly, no music on the process, we have had more difficult pieces mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I was playing a piano together, or with Rock' n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove would not work for a long time, and then, little has little, everything was established as a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your preferred on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with concerts and the fact that I previously ‘ soft ’ this record.
At present, the Prophet Is To Escape From The Earth Fool, and never the same.
The tradeur perfidious risked billions because of his inferiority complex
A smuggler dissembler.
So appoints its former employee the French giant general Corporation, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank has lost due to nearly five billion euros.
Now it appears that Kerviel is a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and, moreover, cannot be regarded as incapable.
Unlike all the large houses of bank, he acknowledged at the time the US mortgage crisis.
"It is fragile," implying his superiors who have reported to the police.
However, according to the testimony of Kerviel reported by the French media, including Le Monde, the transactions of this man produced late last year a profit amounting to EUR 1.6 billion.
The crisis exceeds the US
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in the statement.
Last summer, he was able to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he sensed an opportunity at the beginning of the year.
Information has begun to emerge in February that the so-called "sub-prime mortgage" to low-income customers or to those who had encountered difficulties in the past, would have problems repayment.
But this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and it can bet.
Thus, at the end of the year, profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I won my first half, I did not know how to announce" Kerviel., and he did, of course, nothing left to himself. "
In any interrogation, he admitted distorted the reports not to be identified.
He managed to fool his superiors Eurex, although the stock market has begun to address its transactions.
Who do nothing nothing could spill
Craignait-il to be found?
Rather than.
"I felt that having obtained 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Why has its willingness to risk so large?
He came to office gradually.
He began to work in the Société Générale in 2000 just after he finished his studies at the University of Lyon.
His salary hovered around 51 thousand dollars.
Two years later, he was assistant to tradeur and, in 2005, it became independent tradeur with an annual salary of 90 thousand dollars.
Yet he knew that he would never win as much.
"From my first meeting in 2005, I knew I was much less regarded than others.
In view of my university curricula and my professional experience and staff, "said Kerviel investigators.
However, shortly after he took office, he wins his first great success.
With the Allianz shares, he won half a billion euros on the decline of the title in the London bombings.
And the mechanism was activated, he wanted more.
As long as you reach, you are left in peace
"It was like a snowball," he told the police.
But the superiors were aware of all, or rather, they suspected it.
"As long as I gained, they pretend to close our eyes."
That is when the time comes from the beginning of the year.
It loses EUR 1 billion in a day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to overshadow the sum.
On Monday, when it comes to work, it is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it has lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how do we discovered it?
He became suspicious because of his absence.
"The last year, I was only 4 days off.
A trader fails to holiday is a trader who does not want his book to another, "concludes Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday Czech government ministers have signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, provide 14 billion euros (about $365 billion kronor in the Czech Republic Czech).
It is almost half of the total sum that the Czech Republic can get to Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Almost 125 billion kronor from seven operational programmes will focus on Czech regions.
The Czech companies will get about $100 billion kronor Enterprise Programme and innovation.
The transport sector will benefit from the larger share, up to $150 billion.
The program Transport is the most important and operational programme is up to 22 percent of the Czech Rép. financial resources available for projects.
This money will be an increase in the budget of the National Fund transport infrastructure next year which will manage $90.8 billion kronor.
The programme Enterprise and SME innovation, and entrepreneurs, must be used to obtain funds to encourage innovation in the company.
Businesses should get funding for the introduction of new technologies, research in the industry, but also for the introduction of more effective management methods.
So far, the Czech Rép. was part of the new members, beneficiaries of EU funds for the less successful.
The Court confirmed the death of 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Court of Appeal in Nicaragua confirmed Thursday the death of 20 years in prison for the former president of the country Arnold Alemán, in which he was convicted in 2003 for a fraud of $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion kronor).
However, later he was released and lived under house arrest in his Hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former leader of the state, according to centre-américain between 1997 and 2002, will again encarcéré or not as yet, according to the AP dispatch, unclear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Perez, now everything will depend on prison officers, or they will leave Aleman finish his sentence at home, or will go to prison again.
There are four years, the Tribunal has proven that Alemán spill regularly transferred money into foreign accounts in Panama.
It was fictitious companies and the accounts actually belonged to members of his family and his closest supporters.
Some money went into the funds that had created Alemán spill to finance his campaign in 2001.
It has adopted the budget
It is as well.
The state budget has been adopted.
How is exceptional it?
This is the first by the government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
Anyone for this year is spent a year from the Socialist Party supports the Czech ČSSD, since it is the minister who wrote Sobotka and ČSSD could not afford his refusal.
Unlike the heated debate preceding the vote of no-confidence in the government's statement, this time, nothing dramatic.
The House of Representatives has passed without any problem, although that is most influential, is usually overlooked.
That is a kind of paradox.
Whether we like it or not, each chapter and verse are the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is part of the constituent political, albeit hidden behind the competition of power between government and opposition.
This is more attractive for awarding and granting more attention in the media.
The controversy politicians concerned that spill over steep figures.
The national budgets of socialist governments past three evils that the current budget is not fit to address both:
The first is the important part of the costs imposed by law mandates, not only by pensions, but also by social security contributions, adopted last year by the "silent" coalition of parties and KSČM ČSSD.
The second in an economy's first deficit.
The third hurdle is the lack of public finances, i.e. cities and the deficit.
However, this is not the state budget deficit, which represents the greatest risk.
The public is relatively under control.
The real time-bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, dazed, often expressed their debt obligations, out to municipalities, apart from the money from taxes, fees and bank tax credits, new sources of investment.
In the past, they managed to repay these debts by selling shares in mass distribution systems, including energy, obtained from the state in the context of privatisation.
Today, they do more of this souce.
According to official facts, and verifiable:
Our economy is already for several years, like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD are to be windy.
It was a unique opportunity to successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Now, instead of this state, they involved in debts.
Other countries, with a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania and Egypt, have run their affairs more reasonable than our republic.
Shame monstrous which falls mainly on previous governments.
We are part of the country, on a global scale, are the least threatened by poverty.
So there is no need for massive social programs that have, unfortunately, precisely in recent years unnecessarily swollen.
Although we managed to eliminate some absurd populist spending, approved last year before the election, if a gap of the retirement age and reforming the pension system will not happen soon, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and whoever is in power, he will run.
In éxagérant, we can say that politicians in power will become bureaucrats méchaniquement the majority of distributing money placed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that the costs are driven by the average cost of mandates.
The deficit of 70 billion planned for 2008 would be superfluous if previous governments had not resolved all the money they could.
If we really do not want that politicians in power become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give the fragile coalition government, aware that the state cannot spend the equivalent of what it means to raise taxes and tax rights, calm needed to prepare new laws of reform.
Only those who will help achieve a balanced state budget gradually.

The banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Swiss central banks, and English Canada decided to fight together the crisis of financial markets.
More than 100 billion will be invested in money markets through auction.
It will be for banks to sell, by a downward interest rates, which they are prepared to borrow money.
For example, the US Federal Reserve will send 40 billion auction and provide 24 billion Swiss and the European central banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of individual states have decided at this point to a concerted action to prevent or reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote in his report to clients Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group consultants.
"The combination of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US of 65 percent to about 50 percent," Baumohl said in his report.
The banks have already lost 60 billion because of outstanding loans, especially in the US.
Analysts expect further losses in billion.
"If the central banks have chosen this approach is that it must really grasp what can occur," said the chief economist of the ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It appears that the situation is really bad," he says.
The central banks fear that, if the banks themselves will have a difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and would plunge the US economy into a recession that could affect economic growth in the world.
The central banks have chosen after it failed to bring down the London interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow in the interbank market.
This meant that the banks still feared mutual funds, despite the Canadian and American central banks, English, had declined several times during the fall, their interest rates.
"It will be like a further decline in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio Reuters Tempus Consulting society.
Some analysts do not believe that the approach of central banks will contribute to avert the crisis, because it does not solve the main problem is the fall of the real estate market in the US.
The President Klaus: the debates environmentalists are incredible
The global climate change are supposed to affect mainly to developing countries.
The President Vaclav Klaus has again pronounced on the issue of global warming.
The criticism came this time on the UN International Conference on Climate Change ended in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The blue planet, not green, he stated that the debates environmentalists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, this is not only the structure of the conference, constituted by a curious mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between his rhetoric and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, this is only a rocket of words, ersatz solutions to the problems," said Klaus.
The Czech president said, in his book, that it was important for him and for that he is committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appears in German, because, he said, "I often meets the caricature of my views."
Now the parties concerned can read its positions without being distorted.
Klaus said that although he is not climatologist, he has, in his opinion, enough provisions to write such a book.
It is indeed an academician able to monitor and evaluate scientific treaties, statistical practice and it is also an economist.
The main conclusions are the book, said the following issues: climate change is constantly evolving, it is not normal, there is a view shared by all researchers on global warming, the effects of changes that are neither too high nor too serious, there is no danger and, finally, efforts to influence climate change are unacceptably costly, inefficient and unnecessary.
Moreover, with the experience of a totalitarian regime, it considers unacceptable invérifiées opinions on others what it perceives as a dangerous assault on freedom.
In response to questions of those present, he explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against a fundamentalist environnementalisme which ignores the relationship between the costs and profits they make."
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this two months, the institute Hayek.
600 000 people have failed to renew their licences in the time
Six hundred thousand drivers have been allowed to pass the deadline and failed to renew their former licences whose validity expires at the end of the year.

The approximately 2000 start bonfires at city hall satisfied customers a day.
There is a queue of roughly half an hour.
At Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their licences.

But it is possible to ask the issue in a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an extra SEK 500.
The motorists who will not make the compulsory renewal of licences by the end of the year and will take the road without a permit, valid, possibly as early as January, a fine.
The guilty will be forced to pay two thousand kronor.
However, police may also treat the offence through an amicable approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine climb 2,500 kroner.
According to old information, was liable to a fine even a person who would not move.
Thus it could be forced to pay up to 30,000 kronor.
The department had called the authorities for moderation and impose a fine does not go beyond 1,000 kroner.
According to the spokesman for the Department of Transport Karel Hanzelka, nobody risk fines in tens of thousands.
The driving licence is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not like the identification card, which must be valid without exceptions.
People do more should get their wish driving licences.
It is enough to make or send corresponding to the municipality.
The licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
Yet the motorists are forced to renew progressively other types of licences.
People with documents dating from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to make the renewal.
The validity of licences issued in 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million of other documents.
The tribunal has reduced the sentences of pactés with Berdych détectifs
Josef Koňařík, Petr Opava and former police officers accused of complicity with the gang of David Berdych, will respectively 13 and 10 years in prison.
The higher the Tribunal was convicted of Prague and permanently reducing their sentences respectively to 1 and 2 years.
Initially, the détectifs of the Ministry for combating crime risked sentences of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the ruling pronocé today, only an appeal to the higher court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, it is expected that the trial verdict.
However, it has already received sentences in other trial which exceeds 16 years in prison.
It cannot be given more.
In January, the departmental Tribunal admitted guilty to involvement in the robbery 19 people, with the higher Court of Appeal today harping 16 of them.
Most of the defendants gave, since the beginning of the investigation into question the accusation, saying it was manipulated.
According to the Court of Justice Central Bohemia, members of the police, after an agreement with Berdych, among other criminals transmitted information from police sources, covered the various hold-up gang members and helped to avoid criminal liability.
The gang was 30 percent return to the Opava and Koňařík larceny.
In the charge is the gang of criminal activity in the years 1999 to 2001.
In essence of robberies whose victims are, in most cases, suffered serious damage to health, but also of the abuse of power to a public officer and banned weapons.
In both residential searches, the police has found guns illegally detained, shells with a core of steel, a scope for direct shooting laser or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang was enriched by tens of millions of kronor.
Apart from nearly 20 men of this trial, the courts have already convicted other robberies lifted Berdych and a host of other people.
Other men around Berdych are still trying to explain to the court in another trial, some cases are not yet come up in court.
The main hearing has avoided, for the moment, Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej who now placed in detention in Ireland, where they expect the final decision on their extradition in the Czech Republic.
The price of the replacement of 12 million children:
The lawyer Igor Veleba stricken families to get to the hospital in Třebíč compensation of 12 million kroner over the expense.
Three million for each of mothers and fathers, two million and one million for each of the children.
The hospital proposes a maximum of 200 000 for each parents.
That is why the hospital lawyer Ondřej Dostál does not agree with the proposal of Veleba.
"We reject such a claim, it is very high," Dostál said at the hearing.
"To be able to make decisions on the counterproposal, we need the expert report commissioned by the opposing party's preparation.

Valašské Polívka has lost the Kingdom of Království (Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka has lost the dispute over the Valašské mark of království (Valašsko).
According to the regional court judge in Ostrava, this is his first used the title King of Valašsko, but the project was initiated by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, a former aide to the player.
Polívka was not present at the hearing today.
Now, according to his lawyer, it is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team on the popularity of Bolek freeloaders," Polívka said after the trial counsel for Polívka.
According to him, the Kingdom of Valašsko talk to everyone precisely this actor and comedian.
Harabiš agrees.
"There is a work of almost ten years.
In research and development of events, "he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and they could benefit.
It is they who want parasitize on our work, "he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it is Polívka who used for the first time the title of valašský král (King Valašsko) in his television.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohatý was crowned king in 1993.
At the time, this was not related to the project to develop a shadow kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of a Valašské Království passport.
On a humorous action originally emerged a lucrative business and commercial activity, followed by Harabiš, by Valašské království, of the company.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that his name and his signature should be named in the passport and introduced the holders of balances on the price of a visit to his farm and its theatre.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš has merely used the bare idea, published by Polívka manéž, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Polívka has helped the certainemement Boleslav království Valašské project," said the judge.
She said, however, that the soul of the project was formed by Harabiš and his team engaged in intensive project.
The cooperation between the parties now ongoing rivals in 2000 when Harabiš arranged for Polívka to a Vsetín official coronation.
But then, conflict began to gather between Polívka Harabiš, which has culminated with the evidence "of the king Boleslav 1 elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then inspired by Harabiš, assumed by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, asks the court today rejected.
What could clarify the matter, it is envisaged for the tournament and a half of the princess.
It should step out a new king.
He did not betray the details and the date.
"We do not want to go fast.
that would be seen as the parade of kings to Slovácko.
The King would be elected for some time.
Even Mr. Polívka can obviously register, "said Harabiš.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi diparition prejudiced:
Frankly, I have never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its turnover qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of change of speed, and also to the conduct of the manufacture could, in many ways, be considered a below average.
The market is the Peugeot 207 that his successor, it is much better.
Moreover, the combi appointed SW goes a step further, it remains for me to reflect.
When I tested the hatchback Peugeot 207 of the classic example I felt sorry for space to head on the seats behind.
While there over the complaints because the body combi means that even the big devils will be here at home.
See quick
I shall refer very quickly within and without repeating too much.
It is a pretty successful design, my only comment on the central tunnel which is poor.
Here, I would have liked a more innovative design, since the car looks so elegantly.
The seats are comfortable and when one could complain of seats or records are gone too short.
The lateral guidance has also improved significantly with the model 206.
As for the space, increasing the size of the body is too sensitive.
The combi also sees the lack of disappear from the head said.
A trunk in the trunk
The most important on this vehicle, it is his baggage soutte.
I must evaluate it as easily accessible (also through ice swivelling) and a walk backward rather easy.
The elastic blind spaces of that are ideal.
It is not overburdensome and can be extended and capable of holding objects rather heavy.
But we stop the volume.
In fact, according to the tables, in the shape of the 428, which is based on a competitive rather way.
Apart from the Skoda Fabia Combi, the vehicle for this category in the Czech Republic.
If you compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav, one finds that the Peugeot remains vastly behind, the difference being of 52 litres.
When it comes to take vacations abroad or well send a buggy, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I were to make the benefits, I would mention the remaining below fund after the removal of the files of perfectly right rear seats, or a very low marche-pied.
120 horses over four cylinders
The car that we tested was equipped with an engine Otto of four cylinders with a volume of power and a 1.6 the 88 KW.
In fact, this is what should look like a 1.6 running a family hatchback.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, he grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent product by Skoda, which often gives the impression of having a pot blocked by a serpillère exhaust, then I cannot be as enthusiastic.
Take tariffs
The price of vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, we must be aware that it has tested a car pretty well equipped, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with a driver Otto 1.4 litres of 329 900 Kč is still good.
The vehicle is that we have tested from 410 900 Kč, which is bad enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80 000 Kč.
However, we have prepared to airbags head, an automatic essuis-glace automatic air conditioning, automatic control, a rear windows...
In reality, the vehicle is ultimately 531 900 Kč.
So far, but try to add to the price of the Fabia extra equipment and you will get a very similar figure.
One has to choose the mark.
The integration of Slovak students in schools is ill britaniques
The number of children from the eastern European countries in the growing britaniques schools, that gives the remaining concerns about the development of local education.
The integration of eastern Europeans, for now, in a series of obstacles.
Schools britaniques find cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of people of origin escalated into violence.
The case of the north, where Kent begins to widen the conflict opponents of Slovak origin and migrant residents illustrates the problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe.
The disputes, confrontation and the fights between pupils were transposed in relations between parents.
Things went so far as to Chatham police have arrested a woman who struck with a Slovak iron bar under a pupil of ten years.
The culprit is defended by saying that the boy had insulted by rasistes.
The police also had to intervene following the attack against a Slovak immigrant led by two teenagers.
The girls were allegedly the man and his racist comments cast stones.
"When you came home, a young soared on the bus stop and began to spit on it.
When I told him to stop, he replied by apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks "described another adventure, a mother of unpleasant Slovak pupils.
Complaints are made by both sides.
One of the residents went so far as to describe the conflict with immigrants to fight for survival.
The case described above show that the atmosphere in schools britaniques between the people of origin and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks come to find work are registered in Britain.
The Slovak approximately 30 thousand students britaniques schools.
Cuba, the Caribbean island
For the visitors, an island of freedom.
All you wait for your holidays can happen if you are a good choice.
Some gold-trimmed beaches and white as snow, high waves or even a sea calm as a pond.
Some crowns and all inclusive with waiters on the beach offering you a pizza, ice or intoxicating cocktail parties.
The kitesurfing, golf and the wheel.
On the islands of the Sea of Caraîbes, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find more and Cuba, is the largest and most beautiful island of Great Caribbean.
In time Spaniards, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus was described as the most beautiful place that the human eye has ever seen.
Havana has become the deposit and transfer of assets that Spaniards had stolen and they carried in Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional has been erected in the early 1920s.
It is Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American Mafia, who put it, since it was a crime in the US (especially under prohibition) was recognized and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
We customers, there were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings and cars, led the symbols of the 1950s cults' went over the last century, wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and, in Cojímar, he had his yacht.
The showbusiness stars, and America's politicians were full their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
And now?
You can leave yourself your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cars are still driving cults in Havana, since the jigoulis and the imported fiats have already used in a long, humid climate, and if salted rotten.
Although Havana, especially the most old, decrepit markedly nullepart elsewhere in the region, there so many beautiful colonial monuments are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Given that tourism makes money if necessary, its development has the green light.
During the last fifteen years, new hotels led not only to Havana, but especially Varader, on the coast of the province Holguín, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still proposes a fantasy which is unique in the world and which will be appreciated by the fans of mostly small trains.
The cane plantations was extended in return for a narrow sweets on small steam trains and engine.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and so that we can see in the course of small engines, which are only in contemporary museums.
In its not where?
The majority of visitors are the best known places.
There is therefore no need to write about Varadero or in Havana.
If not remember that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that anyone who likes this writer should not miss the visit.
The Viňales valley west of the island is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba.
A exhubérante vegetation land on a ground limestone.
Some mogotes, balloons sediments and rocks are candle of the valley, and, of the fertile soil is being taken in their insides, even its rotten rocks are manufactured with a very dense vegetal carpet.
The valley where Cuban tobacco is probably the best quality.
You can meet the final shape of this product if you visit a Havana cigar factories.
It might also interesting that it was turned the Chilean episode of Major Zeman.
Trinidad
old-fashioned City shortly after the Spaniards have settled the island.
That is the slave trade market and sugar which brought him fame and wealth.
The wealth is embodied in the beauty and the ville-vitrine nature of this small town.
Koloniální španělská architektura, výrazně ovlivněná pozdějšími francouzskými osadníky za čtyři staletí téměř, nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountain, is a massive Escambray to point out that even in the 1950s will of the last century, there was no road connecting the region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay away.
It is not built, and therefore is not demolished, everyone was content to have a roof over their heads.
If you have, in Trinidad, longer than an afternoon, then it is worth a visit also places interessants in the region, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the valley of Sucreries.
Then, the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa of the Música who warms up after the sun goes down and where the music is deafens that in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some call this village located at the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This view is certainly influenced by the way.
The two roads leading up to it for Guantánamo must cross rugged mountain tops and across a landscape and almost no signs of human activity.
UNESCO has entered the reef east of Cuba, through its countryside intact, on the World Heritage list.
It produces the best chocolate, church, the cross of Christopher Columbus (in reality, it has emerged about 100 years after the voyage of Columbus) and since the hill where is the former chateau-fort Hotel and the current El Castillo, several mountains table, including the most famous is El Yunque.
On the coffee, rum, cigars, the mountainous Sierra Maestra, massive sows Bay and the island of Isla Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the holy patrone of Cuba Caridad del Santeria, Empresa de Cobre, the African religions practised by the descendants of former slaves, about all that it could fulfil a number of pages.
But, as you said, it is better to see again.

We have roughly 90% of the soldiers and equipment we need, it is not enough, "said De Hoop to Reuters at the end of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that lasted three days.
Who is liabilities
In recent months also exist between the countries involved conflicts over the question if all allies do everything in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticised for its passivity.

But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, the fighter requirements are subjects which they are not equal to those in the south and east of the country where we operate, "said Gates.
The britanique Sun tabloid called this week to lazy German soldiers.
"The Afghan layabouts discovered that the Germans are fighting and ours," wrote Sun in a document supplemented by pictures of German soldiers playing the table tenis.
The German newspaper Bild has gone on the counter-attack by publishing pictures of a troop britanique in a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.

The actually occurred in September, when the teacher asks his students, in the age of 6 / 7 years, to choose a name for the teddy bear class.
"Eight names out of the mouths of children, Abdullah and Mohammed Hassan, whose" recounts the school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, on 23 20 children were selected Mohamed as surname preferred.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children were then made a book for the class with the picture of the bear followed the legend 'My name is Mohamed'.
The lui-meme did no label bears with this name, but the problem is simply that of representation of the Prophet regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of fellow Muslims of Gillian Gibbons, teacher in the same school in Sudan, said he knew and she would never have done anything that would be an insult to religious faith, "I just regret that she has asked children to vote for a name," he said that was "an innocent mistake."

In the end, the failure.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians have completed Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final day of discussions without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.

Even today, more than a pregnancy on three (36%) is not anticipated, reveals a study by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after a law which Neuwirth liberalized contraception in France.

Spectaculaire repair on the space station
It took more than seven hours in space to the astronaut Scott Parazynski and his fellow crew member of the International Space Station (ISS) for the repair of a spectacular solar panel riven, essential to the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A quip risky who has accumulated records because of its duration, its distance habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, tools "fixed" by the astronauts for the repair.
The problem began Tuesday when the astronauts of the shuttle Discovery had unloaded the module Harmony, a large cylindrical room to accommodate soon European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This is a kind of dock module of landing for the modules-laboratoires.
But the electricity supply in power.
The second task of the crew was a unit of electricity from solar panels weighing 17.5 tonnes, already on the ISS, to put it in position on its final position.
After having moved, the crew began the redeployment module's solar panels that have a wingspan of 76 metres.
That is one of the signs, which will unfold as accordions, was damaged on nearly a metre by a cable that has stuck.
The deployment has been stopped to avoid further harm to the trap.
The astronauts, originally scheduled to conduct an exit from the shuttle Discovery control, then go repair another solar panel whose rotation system was flawed, were forced to devote themselves to the trap damaged.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to prance within 30 metres of the remote arm of the shuttle added to the station to make repairs.
This is one of the best "spacewalker" (marcher space) of the Nasa.
Grand, resistant, very smart, he has developed the torso and very long arm.
In 46 years, the doctor was responsible for training to operate, "the solar panel" wounded. "
After precisely inspected the damage, he has severed the cable guy and put the kinds of ‘ hames ’ on the damage.
He was helped by a second "spacewalker" remained near the bottom of the interior, and, by other astronauts whose Peggy Whitson, the ordering of the crew.
The tool he used, a hockey minicanne gift-wrapped to avoid electrocution insulation on the solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "stitched up" by the astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation ended, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel is fully deployed before making an inventory of its tools and regaining the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts were getting a half-day of détente until today, seven astronauts will regain the shuttle Discovery to return Wednesday on Earth.
The title EADS sanctioned stock market
The action EADS is currently net reduction in the Paris stock market, after the aeronautical and defence group announced it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to meet the delays to the A400M.
EADS loses 4 percent to 21.96 euros at the Paris stock exchange.
The group was forced to revise its forecast for 2007 operational result of the delays caused by the slow pace of development of the engine of the A400M, which governs the inaugural flight of the plane.
The cost to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, more than 1 billion for Airbus," said the parent company of European manufacturer EADS.
Because of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets for 2007 (EBIT) in the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, without adding further details quantified.
The group also indicates that the estimate of costs is consistent with the delay of six months.
For operational, the result of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly because of costs relating to the delays on another program, the biggest carrier A380.
Initially, The group provided a first delivery of the French army A400M in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense, Sunday, exit polls: the Russians massively will opt for the party of President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming their aspiration to stability, even to authoritarianism, after a campaign very locked.
In three days of parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin directed today to voters a message on public television channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
It is as the top of the pro-Kremlin United Russia party, whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president has not now revealed by receiving foreign ambassadors, preferring to deliver a new attack against the West accused of interference - his campaign theme.
"We know the price of a real democracy and want fair elections, the more open, more transparent and the smooth elections," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, it is far from enough.
It betrays a tainted campaign of pressure.
The Communist leader Guennadi Zyuganov said there has never been an election as "dirty, even in the Yeltsin era."
After the demonstrations last weekend, the former Alpine skier who was co-president of the world of chess Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, is forbidden to visit according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of homo sovieticus'
Behind these two legislative issues without suspense are much more open:
– Who will succeed Putin for the presidency?
The official newspaper yesterday issued the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to identify themselves.
Elu in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
But there is no successor.
What role will Putin - after March?
Prime Minister?
As head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
Nevertheless, the presidential elections, as the outgoing power will triumph.
It is a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny," considers the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov State University, St. Petersburg, goes further: civil society has been delayed in this country converted five centuries after Europe; the famous Community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin has rediscovered the model of a patriarchal state fully accepted by the people, especially since this new paternalism has not been followed by terror, but by some comfort," feels Maria Lipman economic, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians voluntarily surrender "personal responsibility" to which they had briefly shown after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why bother?"
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including business.
And the administrative elite wants to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (about 85 Heads of Russian regions) to run the local United Russia lists.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general prefer stability.
How can the Russians do not vote for extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a professor of 54 years: "Why bother thinking?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why the change? "
A huge memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, who recall the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are freely available.
The 47 million archival documents stored on 27 km of linear at Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were made available in so far as a 'humanitarian' goal, individually and nominative, on request of a former victim or his successors.
The 11 Member in charge of their management about Germany, France, Israel and the Etats-Unis- agreed in May 2006 for the open to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification by all Member being completed, the actual opening since yesterday.
Information sensitive
Access to Bad Arolsen historians will conduct research "on the movement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health of workers forced," explains Reto Meistern, the director of the archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, many countries, including Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these documents personals, because of the sensitivity of certain information.
As homosexuality supposed mentally handicapped or the victims of deportation.
The records of concentration camps or arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo were ready after war in a practical purpose: to regain civilians deported or subjected to forced labour and eventually provide proof of their commitment to open the way to their compensation.
Even today to Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees treat tens of thousands of individual applications.
Yet, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to wait for these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz in 2006, director of the Centre for Research on anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin.

Will there be a year-end rally in the stock market? Experts divided by the crisis of sub-primes.
In less than five weeks of the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands hoping the arrival of the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year the experts are not so certain that this will happen.
Banif believes that "statistically in December, the stock market has generally good behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to forecast exclusively based on statistics, since that given the current context, the uncertainties threaten to markets, at least in the short term ".
While they are not supporters took to the impetus in the final weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is fueled by the existence of liquidity, prepared to invest the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income, affected by the effect of fleeing to the values of quality as well as in the long periods in the short".
For that, they believe that the stock market will take a lateral behaviour rather than without volatilities, "particularly because it ignores the likely impact of lower Fed rates, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, head of sales of BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the time to say that there will be a rally.
"It is not the best thing," provides the expert.
The Ibex, the Spanish stock index, has lost nearly 4% since November 8, when the index closed at 15.945,7 points.
But not all analysts have this negative vision.
Juan Solana, an analyst, believes that the Intermoney could Ibex 35 16 points to finish this year with the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension schemes that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuance that things are a little different this year, because it believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the deck of the celebration of the Constitution (December 6).

The analyst hope that they will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for the maximum Ibex towards new coats.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "the great values this year are back for him."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some builders "because when the date, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
While, Federico Inversis Banco Olucha, to ensure that the increase in the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders may also benefit from this rally, where they are.
"ACS positions for several months recovers and we hope that other manufacturers like Ferrovial and FCC suiveront the same way," writes the expert.
The cyclical consumption will protagonist in the last part of the year due to increased sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology firms can do so as well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the past seven years, only two occasions during the month of December has been a month bear.
The year-end authentic rally took place in 2003, when the stock markets carrying out of the crisis triggered by the opening of the technological bubble.
This year, during which the Ibex has recovered 35 28,17%, the month of dicembre rose 6,68 percent.

station Telecinco double for the first time in stock market value of its rival Antena 3
We have grown.
With this sentence delegate Paolo Vasile, an adviser to station Telecinco, yesterday expressed his satisfaction at the close of the stock market, when he discovered that the chain has doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
A unique aspect tarnished his joy: will it hurts me, this is not the fact that we have increased but we have fallen less, "stating '.
However, he stressed that on a weak market, will we have less fallen will.
Yesterday station Telecinco ended the day with an increase of 2.54%.
The gain steadies his loss to 15,66 percent from a year ago.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13%) reached the EUR 4.488,88 million, according to Bloomberg data.

The value of companies listed comunication $3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518,53 million in the editor of Cinco Prisa (Días) and 1.779 million in Vocento.
According to Vasile, the analogy of Antenne 3 is the fact that we are talking about two companies' similar.
The fact is on what we can do in the same market at what price and how we make profitable in terms of audience will.
station Telecinco announced last week that he expects this year to become the first television channel to surpass 1, 000 million gross advertising revenue, said Giuseppe Tringali, as the station Telecinco and Publiespaña delegate, the subsidiary that manages the advertising group.

Vasile ensures that, although it is early to take a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in partnership with Mediaset.
"We have to give the official compromise for 50% minimal, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope we can be happy with our shareholders, where we have already given titles with the 33% of Endemol '.
According to analysts, the market is now signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers has recently lowered its estimate of profits on station Telecinco in 2008 and 2009, 4% to 7%.
This is because, they argue, declining growth forecast revenue from 8.4% 10.5% in 2008 and 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company has decreased the earnings forecast of Antenne 3 to 4.5% -7.5% in 2008 and 2009.

The agents continue to search the premises and those of the municipal council of Urbanisme and it would not rule out the possibility of new rulings in the next few hours.
Moreover, the lawyer for Juan Morales, head of the fabric of suspected corruption urbane, at the beginning of this discovery, has been charged stalking.

Bono will be at the head of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidate for Toledo and chairing the Congress if they win elections
The former Defence Minister Jose Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be at the top of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party to Toledo for the next general election and be president of Congress if the Socialists win the general election.
Thus the secretary of the Socialist Party organization, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced during a press conference after the meeting this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to rely on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best."
Moreover, he stressed that "yes" it seems that the politician of La Mancha will be the candidate of the Socialist Group who will chair the Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of Congress, which he made public on 15 November his decision not to stand for prochainess election and to abandon his political career to engage in the fight against climate change in the university context.
The former president has acknowledged that the Government has continued to insist that he will return to political leaders since he abandoned two years ago.
Moreover, it was noted that, although the people already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist party wins the election, his party wanted to announce who will chair the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reached the post, Bono hope turning the House in "a house of respect and not to insult or to cry" and "that they increasingly resemble the citizens".
"Sometimes it seems that the only local miserably in Madrid where we cannot speak calmly and quietly is Congress, the president of the Government in the Senate has brought in some occasions interrupted 26 times".
Similarly, he had words of praise for its current president, Manuel Marín and "his knowing" and he did not do as if it was his position not to step, as he pointed out, in what opponents could call "dominant".
A climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change requires a persecution without mercy both skeptics of his predictions that those who gives priority to social and political conflicts, it must demonstrate a coherence of iron.
This is especially the case for a leader of the movement who is chairman of the Government as Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamic terrorism and to sign a new contract for the planet. "
This approach requires him to explain why action or inaction, his Government contributed decisively to concluding that Spain is at the head of the European Union in the Kyoto Protocol non-éxecution.
Who is responsible for the non-éxecution, where has this happened and why his Government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided.
Moreover, it should be clear to the Spaniards what it will take to halt climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens should be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will we have to make it provoquera-t-il economic consequences.
That is to say, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has been and there will be no explanations.
Precisely because it comes to sacrifice and pay.
The measures against climate change, the real measures are unpopular.
Coûteuses, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Until the hundredth of gasoline suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party is as dangerous to Zapatero electoralmente if he is quick to dismiss.
That is to say that it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, empty slogans of any real consequence.
With phrases that have the impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, Mr. so useful for campaigns who do not speak, who do not denounce and does not require the rallies, grows and inspires tenderness.
Provided this limited only to be a purely virtual party and who does not pretend that we moved by bicycle or we cooled with the range.

By contrast, the cds flight in a store of less than 400 euros, is regarded only as a fault (article 623.1).
B. The theft in a store worth up to EUR 1000 is already an offence, but the death is less than that for the download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and you go 40 hours after the death penalty is below the limit for the download (article 244.1).

My doctor told me about one of its articles on research entitled: "The money strange brain activations product, especially if individuals receive less will.
That is to say that the sentiments that generates monthly pay depends on what workers earn their colleagues.
The study was conducted by magnetic resonance tomographiques at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group of images of the Institute Life & neurocognition brain, Germany: "The biggest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his comrade-in-arms failed".
Scientists have observed that when the two people guessed that they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received double, the activation was greater.
I do not know if this conclusion required both of science.
The Balkan prosecutor
Carla del Ponte for eight years continues relentlessly Balkan war criminals since the prosecution of the Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
His mandate expires at the end of the year and Carla is out with a bitter taste, because the main responsibility for the murder of Srebrenica, where Muslims were killed 8000 bosniens, the former serbobosnio leader Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list of Swiss filmmaker whose documentary Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, will the list of Carla (2006, not planned exclusively in Spain), with the pace of a thriller policeman, following the work of the Swiss prosecutor in New York from Belgrade who pursues the fugitives and pressure on the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What assurance with me?
Motor insurance, which covers the driver contingency claims, which implies a significant expenditure will depend on various factors such as age, sex, the driving age, marital status, the type of vehicle to provide or use it in fact, among others.
Having a car that is the main.
Is is that escoger el seguro de automóvil, adecuado más difícil incluso story that elegir el modelo de vehículo.
And it is that, choose appropriate auto insurance, is even more difficult to choose the model of the vehicle.
The insurance car is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise materializing by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium paid and it becomes responsible for paying compensation in cases of disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is taking into consideration factors such as age, sex, the driving age, marital status, the type of vehicle or the usageque to ensure it is, among others.
Insurance companies set their price statistics, according to the likelihood of an accident, the greater the rating to pay is high.
That is why people and women must pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these persons have a lower rate of losses in their care.
Similarly, using the censuses, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and hence on the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing the frequency, the chances are increasing.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when determining the price of the premium.
That is why, the driver must examine the situation to choose automobile insurance who adjusts the best in his profile.
We will now the most significant variables for selecting either type of insurance, and, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offered a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 face various drawbacks in delivering a contract with affordable insurance, as can be the low experience and seniority in the conduct of licences.
Although the ideal be sure to be an insurance at any risk, other options are more economical.
Drivers can choose the most far-sighted risk insurance with frankness, so that they get the insurance coverage at any risk but at a price more accessible.
This form of convention implies that the customer pays a portion of the amount of disaster.
"The part of the amount that the customer pays the sinister based on the value of the premium, which will be higher as the amount is low," says Luis Noguera, head in Spain for First on-line Europa, insurance broker.
Another option is enlarged to third, so that the customer protection to cope with the damage caused to third parties, but for those caused by his own car.
Moreover, it would be covered against theft, fires and the loss of the vehicle.
A Council.
If you are a 25 years and he tries to be careful to avoid accidents, if possible, because it has implications for the discount, which can reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A reduction is a reduction in the basic rate of the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a basic rate increase.
"The discounts and sanctions will depend on the company and profit from it.
If the company had a good year it can afford to increase the subsidies, "clarifies Noguera.
Beyond the 25 years it becomes easier for drivers in delivering a contract with an insurance, since the accident rate is reduced through the experience accumulated.
That is why it is preferable to make any risk insurance truthfully.
"Normally young people cannot take advantage of the experience gained after an accident beforehand," the director of the European company in Spain and adds that most accidents occur during the second year of action, after the European afraid of novice will.
However, if the customer is married but has not yet children it is preferable to negotiate a momento, the risk that its economic situation permits.
The marriages with children are regarded by insurers as those with the lowest rate of losses, because the increases will be weaker.
In this case the best insurance risk insurance would be openly (300 euros), or a third assurance extended from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of profit.
"They have a more relaxed and driving their purchasing power to afford to assume a greater proportion of excesses," Judge Luis Noguera.
For pensioners insurance at any risk with frankness (as it is preferable to 150 euros), or an enlarged asurance to third when the insurer has a high level of profit.
We must say that automobile insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver contingency claims, but also because it represents an important expenditure, so it is essential to deal with the assurance that we need in our most personal situation.
The Celtic will seek to earn a point in Milan to reach the final elimination
The AC Milan and Glasgow Celtic measured Tuesday in San Siro to the point they need to achieve their respective objectives in the closing of the Champions League, since it serves the Italians to be first and for Scots to classify.
The Italians totaled 10 points and they have already qualified for the fifth day thanks to a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still need another point to ensure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who gets Benfica, who has four not before him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth day ends, because the AC Milan must compete for the Cup's semifinales of Clubs Japan on 13 of this month in search of a place in the final of 16 December.
Thus, this group will remain closed until the draw on stage Giuseppe Meazza seems to be the outcome as expected, although the two teams will try to emerge victorious, because the Italians will not want to speculate at home and in Glasgow Celtic knows that he will remain Prime and winner would ensure a better grade in the final elimination.
A defeat of the team of Gordon Strachan could be enough to categorize themselves if the Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but they will not only on this because of computer games with nine points of the Ukrainian, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese evening to try to poison the Scots, who hope to classify the elimination round for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the latest edition by a goal from Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
Meanwhile the victory of the 'rossoneri' Shakhtar victory would only in cases where Celtic would be, for the elimination round to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that the Benfica, although it is final and without opportunities to pursue European competition, could reach the third place with a victory.

The new gas deal between Russia and Ukraine lays the alarm.
A dispute over gas pricing ferments between Ukraine and Russia, thereby increasing the risk of impact on oil exports to Europe.
Most of Russian gas exports to the European Union (U.E) are escorted by pipelines, and each led is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes in Russia.
Last year, a dispute between the two, had caused a decrease of supplies to the countries of the European Union
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia's property monopoly supplying gas, have tried in vain to find agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase as expected, its price to Ukraine since he agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from Turkmenistan's neighbour.
Analysts said that it would for Ukraine, an increase of 40% of the costs of imports from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, saying that we are a country through which passes most of gas," said the Ukrainian minister, Anatoly Kinkh economics at the Reuters news agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would be linked to our discussions about taxes of transit (to Western Europe) via Ukraine ’
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, has caused the interruption of supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine.
This has led to the collapse of exports to Western Europe, by increasing the price.
The Russian gas supplies represents a quarter of the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still in developed countries.
Consequently, complete with its own Gazprom gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The health ministry must control its foreign employees' '.
The Scottish health ministry should improve the controls on extra-community employees to check whether they have criminal precedents, said the monitoring committee.
The warning of General Réviseur, Robert Black, occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotland, was involved in the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Mr Black has also expressed its concern about the fact that the Scottish health ministry has no precise data on the number of people it employs overseas.
His report has highlighted other controls, properly carried out on a decisive sample of employees of five health authorities.

Among the many warnings, the auditor general's report states that the committees are required to compare with the Bureau of control of criminal precedents, allowing employers to undertake, controls in various countries.
"Although we discovered that some personnel information have been checked, it is done every time announcing the report.".
Mr Black said the health department conducts most Scots controls meadow job he had himself, but he also said: "our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain staff overseas health services are available.
Mr Peter Terry BMA, chairman of Scotland said it is "extremely unlikely" that controls meadow jobs can identify employees likely to commit future terrorism.
He says "the report suggests that controls meadow employment, work is being conducted in the Scottish health system and it is not clear that these warnings can bring an added value."
The Scottish health authorities said employ 1,161 people overseas, accounted for most of doctors and nurses.
But the auditor general stressed that these figures should certainly be revised upwards, partly because of the problems relating to the identification of staff with permanent contract or not, who could choose to stay in our country.
It showed that the current procedures controls and health authorities in Arran, Grampian Ayrshire, Greater Glasgow, and Clyde Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite adequate.
These controls are carried out on passport, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government now reconsider its policy and its monitoring system meadow employment for the staff addition ocean health service.

Saudi Arabia is blocking 208 plots terrifying
Saudi Arabia has yesterday revealed having arrested 208 militants involved in cells organizers scheming an imminent attack on an oil site and attacks against the clerics and armed forces.
The state television world's largest oil exporteur, said that a missile bootleggers cells.
The supporters of Al Qaeda have staged a campaign against the monarchy ally in the US since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell, consisting of eight militants headed by a foreign resident planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, said the newspaper TV.
Saudi Arabia has quickly formed a group of 35 soldiers to protect sites, following an attack failed to al-Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper, quoting a statement by the Minister of Interior, said that 18 of those arrested belong to a cell headed by an "expert" to launch missiles which has infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants planned a bunch of eight against missiles in the kingdom.
22 people deriving among detainees plotting the murder of priests and armed forces.
The government has asked the clerics to run more against the Saudis in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting against the Forces Together against the government and Muslim Shiite ally in the US, considered heretical by the hardline Saudi Sunny.
The militants argue that Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia, many clerics have cooperated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family who dominates the government.
The militants, encouraged by the Saudi government calls against the West, by Osama Bin pro- Laden, Al Qaeda leader of Saudi origin, have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and sites for energy supplies.

The atmosphere of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists have yesterday said that Venus has certainly been a planet pleasant to live.
The data from the European spacecraft in orbit have shown that the planet is two times smaller than the Earth, contrary to what we thought before.
Venus is the closer to the planet Earth.
These two worlds are virtually the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Soleil.
Scientists now believe that billions of years, Venus might have been conditions similar to those of the Earth, and could even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect on carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to a solar radiation allied Venus slower rotation led to just another kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is devastated by hurricanes and storms of strokes and has a surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead.
The findings of the probe Venus Express, the European Space Agency - who has studied the planet for a year, offer a bleak vision of the future potential of the Earth's atmosphere catastrophic changes.
The professor of the department of physics at Oxford University, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the mission of Venus Express, said: "we begin to understand why the atmosphere of Venus is so different from the Earth, although the planets as they are even similar.
"Our new data we can establish a scenario in which there are billions of years, Venus was originally identical to the Earth, possibly with a habitable surface."

More open to all
Mitt Romney said inadequacy as presidential candidate, to answer questions of a man of snow.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates have finally agreed to participate in the debate on You Tube, during which many ordinary voters have seen their questions, the candidates themselves.
Last Wednesday 28 November, no questions has been as ludicrous as the outcome of another debate on You Tube, when a man of snow asked Democrats with their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers have much reflected the conditions of the Republican Party, candidates in the next election.
We will not know what criteria, producers of CNN, which has sponsored the debate, chose the videos of You Tube to show the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest approaching a single theme, was focused on immigration.
The issue is a strong subjects for the Republicans.
CNN has asked some voters to phone when they would hear something pleasant: The survey regulatory approval increases when the candidates were so great.
The exchange the hardest and most long night was between Rudy Giuliani, National Front leader and Mr. Romney who is ahead of important elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was soft on illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, employ illegal immigrants at home.
The two combatants have become particularly ferocious when they were asked whether they would be willing to promote a "amnésia" (offering regular status to illegal immigrants and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
A minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, were able to pursue this matter.
None of them has the ability to be elected, but both remain in the race, may be due to the fact that they have begun to fight immigration before and more incisive than others.
In general, the candidates, at least on immigration, have the same view: tougher borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This, combined with the particular concerns raised by the case of toxic toys manufactured in China, or many other fears to the external world, favors the Republicans to forget, or to minimize the divisions between the Libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate has become particularly embarrassing when other subjects were raised.
Mr Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the campaign for arms control.
John McCain and Mr Romney have debated whether into the nose should be regarded as a torture.
One of the speakers asked whether the candidates believed in its entirety, the contents of the Bible.
This led Mr Giuliani to dare to say that the Bible is his favorite book, even if it is not about to believe in the history of Jonas and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
We did not expect to see Mike Huckabee, - in pole position Iowa during a recent election, thanks to his long-time Christian conservatism, declaring that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favour, he laughed and said that Jesus is too smart to stand for election.
The human race remains open to all insolitement.
The rise of Mr. Huckabee Iowa coincides with the recent dramatic research grants conducted by the libertarian Ron Paul, and the hisses on Wednesday.
These two there are nothing emerged, thanks to the fact that both the party cannot agree to decide who is the candidate more experienced and more traditionalist.
In 1980 and 2000, created a candidate and the party convincingly with a message of great success in bringing the American leaders.
This time, the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
The ritual of pain
Gordon Brown has found a new hole in which sink. Even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the tendency of British scandals, it is not particularly good.
Not decorations sold or Paris hotel bills for politicians, not to walk out of wedlock sucked outside.
But that is a revelation that a wealthy businessman would be masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party's, equivalent to more than 650,000 pounds ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle which Gordon Brown would be well spent.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister has retreated in an election, insulting stupidly British intelligence proclaim that opinion polls have not influenced his decision, and he hoped to offer a compact and efficient government.
On the contrary, as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said the terrifying Mr Brown has turned to Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The takeover of Northern Rock, a troubled bank on the edge of the star, has shown a gap of directives and poor judgment in emergencies.
The inadequate proposals for change in the tax code led to a coalition of industry groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million of personal data from the tax authorities, has been an incredible administrative blunder.
A trio of retired generals have launched a rebellion among the Lords, protest the cuts in military spending: proclaiming that be Defence Minister is for them, a part-time job.
At present, the suspected shady donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of Labour (and its former leader of the vigilance) that they have had to resign.
None of this means that Mr Brown is moving irresistibly toward the exit.
But governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People do not like politicians, and did not trust them, but generally leave their doubts away at a new government in power.
It seems obvious that a Prime Minister can improve things, or even run for a long time, then he risk suspension: the public administration no longer works; the record; the press are looking bad stories; and the government becomes more defensive and without any objective.
In a sense, Mr Brown is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a beginner.
Although he wishes to repudiate Tony Blair, he has been his top lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and data taxes, for example, are linked to decisions taken by Mr Brown as chancellor of the British treasury.
And even if it is not directly involved in the misfortunes of Blair, as the long investigation of the "cash for the members of the House of Lords, voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation that Mr Brown faces is not so tragic as it sounds.
The gaffes are not now so as members of the Tory Party seems.
Like Mr Bean, there is no victim or fraud.
And the cure, although painful, could be pursued Stalinist tendencies Brown, for a reliable government and slightly brutal.
The latest scandal on political donations is a good example.
Mr Abrahams, a very special character, which compares his donations to charity, said that it wanted no public recognition of his charity.
He may have his views, but this is not his decision.
Laws against the anonymity of the big subventionneurs politicians are clear, and they exist for good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who govern the country.
Mr Watt, who said to be aware of Mr Abrahams, without knowing that it was illegal, must therefore be questioned, as Jon Mendlesohn, the head of collections of subsidies which had spoken questionable donations in October.
So far, Mr. Brown is not involved: There is no evidence that he was aware of this, even if most payments were made after his arrival in government in June.
So far the Prime Minister did half.
He has quickly condemned the weakness of his party, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the power of decision is based on a trick he knows well, make use of a committee of inquiry on this subject consisting of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been flouted, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent committee of Standards of public life, without leader for six months, and prepare a good reform on the funding of political parties.
That would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to cooperate with the Tories, which could cause it to abandon its financial report especially confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter as Mr Brown.
But it should face some facts supporters.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the elections; he has two years to recover the voters, and the only way to get a victory is to demonstrate a strong integrity and competence.
Escroqueries of cards.
The mortgage crisis contaminerait-elle the American market credit cards?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural to see the fins poked, whirl around.
Now that the US housing market through a critical phase, predators are aimed at American market credit cards.
Analysts from Goldman Sachs thinks that the credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the infection is spreading mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
There are clear signs of tension.
A rate increases in the cost of insolvency, which measure the shares of non-recoverable record or who are, after more than 30 days.
HSBC announced last month that he took $1.4 billion in loans to consumers, partly because of the weakness of the bearers.
It is too early to panic.
The costs and the insolvencies are still moderates.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3,89 per cent lower than the troixième quarter is almost a point compared to its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly be explained by technical factors.
A change laws in 2005, the US on personal bankruptcy has caused a severe drop archives of bankruptcy, which in turn has caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of record (and therefore) of insolvency rate could increase borrowing even if the conditions were worse.
The industry also announced fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers must solve.
secure and confidence in the capital of credit cards is relatively strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the volume of 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct links between the infection mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers may prefer to increase their debts now that real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers are more attention to the flow of cash rather than the value of the assets, and thus falling home prices did not necessarily bring about a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even benefit issuers of credit securities.
Premiums consumers for payment mortgages fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; by consequence, credit card debt would become a priority to repay it.
The card issuers are able to respond much more quickly and more flexibly mortgage crisis in such conditions, because they can change interest rates or alter the limits of rédit.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid recovery actions.
"We are not going to wake up one morning and reassess all borrowing." said Gary Perlin, the director of Capital One.
If a financial disaster credit card market is unlikely, there is a strong risk of substantial decline.
If the real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market led America into recession, the industry will surely face a macabre future.
Be careful not to fins ridges.
The British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were to attend their roles compared to a fraud committed by the former financial director, Mr Andrew Fastow, Enron, have changed their statement, pleading guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally declared innocent of seven charges for alleged fraud committed by collusoire in 2000, Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich themselves in spite of their employees.
They should appear in court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by the American judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they were all guilty of committing a fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous throughout Britain because of procedures for extradition, which lasted two years.
In the US, their case remains an open question for this inquiry launched following the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The charges that were imposed in 2002, Fastow realized that he was being investigated by the government in the Enron debacle.
The charges against the three bankers, called the "Natwest" claim to be reached Houston in 2000, to organise a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich has invested in an Enron subsidiary of a partner controlled by Fastow, who was the orchestrator of many fraudulent scenarios, which has helped àtruquer bankruptcy procedures.
In early 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as null, but in fact the three are already British devaluation.
A Kopper controlled company bought the interest of the bank for the subsidiary of £1 million.
The bankers have paid $250 to Kopper as interest in the company.
According to the charge, Fastow was Enron falsely announced that the energy company was ready to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers would have received $7.3 Fastow, while Kopper and others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures imprisonment of six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper was imprisoned for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The British three were released after the payment of a deposit of $1million each, which requires them to live in the US during the trial.
Enron, formerly seventh largest national company in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of fakings accountants, could not hide his billion of debt or even move his belly as profitable speculation.
The collapse has resulted in thousands of redundancies, more than $60 billion of market value and loss of more than $2 billion loss for the retirement plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling excused the former president General were sentenced last year for their involvement in the collapse of the company.
Skilling excused was sentenced to 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were empty because of his death due to a heart attack last year.
Neither before nor outside Moscow.
The cost of a plane G550 Gulfstream, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine fuel autonomy sufficient to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, part of $54 million.
But it is only a small change for some Russians.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if nobody really need as many seats as it is more of an aircraft or for family use the president of a society."
Mr Firer was present at the exhibit Gulfstream, Friday at the Millionnaires Salon, an incentive to consumption binge, during four days, in an enormous exhibition centre around the capital.

The salon seems primarily aim to new rich, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to make waiting in traffic jams to come up with a big warehouse which outlines the Cadillac Escalades, of platinium, penknives ice in Mövenpick, billiard tables personalized, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bear.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).

Indeed, dealers said here that the possession of old Russian capital (10 to 15 years are too by standards of Russia) have already become logos bursting with a kind of limited edition which could not be sold to room.
Despite this, thousands of people, or millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, roving exposure every day.

Even though many Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, seen rising home prices here.
"if you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years, you would be already a millionaire, at least on paper, except in case," said Putin.

Surgeon not accedes suspected of homicide in New Jersey
That was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston watched by the picture window of the restaurant Just a little Healthier and observed an ambulance from stopping the doors of white Cape Cod on the Avenue West Scott.
Then came the patrol of the police.
and then another.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop" Mr. Livingston restaurant, an official said Wednesday.
That is what I realized that someone had died.
The authorities then learn that the deceased was a woman aged 41 years, Olga Arroyo, assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of death is due to a gesture executed by a cosmetic surgeon not approved, that the police have not yet identified, resident Avenue in 212 West Scott.
The authorities have not yet determined the cause of death of Miss Arroyo, but they are confident, the results of toxicological tests, which will take time, but which should settle this mysterious death which has saddened the senior ranks of the police of Newark.
Miss Arroyo's assistant was the director of the police, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and his voice was well-known in various departments.
It was fair, great worker and tenacious, "McCarthy said about Miss Arroyo, in a telephone interview Wednesday."
"it was like a pit bull »
"it would have done everything to protect me."
Mr McCarthy said that Miss Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Board of Control of Alcooliques Boissons, and she leaves two sons of 14 and 11 years, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsj, the floor of the Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives were trying to determine whether Miss Arroyo died because of unauthorized surgery.
"It is an opportunity to consider."
"the investigation continues."
The authorities have said to be arrived at home.
Miss stream and have found on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even on the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh could not confirm whether Miss Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Investigators seek to understand whether a part of the house was used as medical office.
On Wednesday, nobody has opened the door to a country where Miss Castro rosebush faded in the cemetery is close to, and a Dalmatian barked at the back.
A blue Vanillin called "Ethyl bogus" used as a substitute vanilla in kitchen and perfumes, lay in a hangar, missing a door that leads to below ground.
Two mountain bikes hung on both sides.
McCarthy said that since his arrival in Newark 25 years ago, the New York Police Department, Miss Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping him to navigate in the new city and managed to abandon its political culture.
"she said," you must be careful in this racontait-il '.
"it was when I was coming, and again when I went off.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hope that the Fed will reduce rates linked to the turmoil of the global market.
The actions are ordnance on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market hoped that the Fed would have tried to ease credit conditions, further reducing interest rates promoted by the statements salving of Vice Chairman of the US central bank.
The stock markets are exploding in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No 2 after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide, must be "flexible and pragmatic in their actions in 'turbulent financial markets.
In an apparent effort to reassure the markets irritable seen these new tensions linked to credit, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence "has partly reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market late September and October.
In case this harsh turbulence persists, it would increase the likelihood of a rigid financial conditions for future owners and businesses, a-t- he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Fed is ready to inject new capital into American markets, and that further interest rate cuts would stabilize credit conditions.
It has also helped calm Wall Street with more bad news on the American economy, such as the biggest drop in property sales for October.
The repercussions of this financial turmoil has been intensified following the announcement of Bear Stearns, investment bank, announcing that it will lay off 650 people, i.e., 4% of its staff, to cut costs to offset the heavy losses fashion losers covers real estate loans.
only 20 posts are provided in London where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2,55 percent to 13.289,40 while the largest index, S & P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index has gained 165,5 points 100 or 2.7 percent to 6306,2 adding over GBP 39 the value of British companies.
The German Dax index rose to 2.6% CAC40 and the French took 2.3%.
Previously, the resurgence of difficulties in the credit markets has been highlighted by the strong demand for an auction of monthly sorting funds derived by the European Central Bank, which slashed their loans to commercial banks in heavy European rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the subsequent infusion of funds currently and in London financial markets, causing tension credit have been borrowing rates monthly sorting "Libor" British banks, led to their highest growth since September, following a sharp rise 6,59 percent since November 12.
Britain faces an appeal judgment over the criticism of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the batsman No 6 to England in the week ending Kandyan Owais Shah Ravi, or Bopara?
And even more important in a broad context that the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will take the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, Chairman of selectors who was exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to take its decision, and because the Office of Hugh Morris, President Director General of England, begins to fill out the forms for becoming a national selector, at least part time.
Anyone who will not win the number No 6 will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport.
It is never easy to destroy what allows a man to reach the top of his profession while another never happens beyond the lower level, sometimes by more than luck by lack of ability.
Not only to cricket that the selection is difficult, because in the end, the subjective judgment remains.
East the right time to do emerge Bopara?
Is justice Shah?
The same could be put in another context, which choose between John Edwards' or 'Banerjee tubby?; both, new managers who had good professional qualifications, should be promoted, but there is room for only one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketeur unless it is given at least a chance?
The figures are important in the decisions, but also the opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketeur must catch the eye of the captain, at the same time it must take the door and a batsman must be lucky to get the cricketeur a day.
But catch the eye of selectors is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, although Stephen Harmison said in shape and still remained to be resolved.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 rounds to win a seat.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 to the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and still hope to offer.
If that is Shah Bopara who will play on stage or Asgiriya, it is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build the career of a man, but it made little difference.
Four years ago, Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty has played in every Test and has done well in the first, with five doors and 40 rounds useful, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was struggling to emerge, who has managed to become the leading cricketeur in Test, and that, despite the fact that his double hundred scored against Australia in Australia can still be considered.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, following another discussion after the session today on their Asgiriya, will certainly conservative instincts and promote greater experience of Shah against the exuberance of the young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, bright and early in his innings of considerable Test of 88 in Bombay, 32 cents for first-class against six Bopara to 22ans, who is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah only ten rounds in its two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord, the city of the Middlesex player, and that the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan to new form, in third place for the next game, seems to have tarnished his flights so obvious in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy of living.
Nothing fears about a lot of cricket and he has exaggerated when he recently overturned on a 4x4 during a presentation of Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
He has postponed that slight injuries, was shocked, even if the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor well on) and call Alastair Cook, his team member who watched from afar, "and asked him if he had seen it?"
Bopara is by far the best batsman, it looks tailing him to his services, and he will cope with confidence and professionnalité.
Choosing the right man is one thing, timing is another.
Perhaps the true art of the selection?
I would be conducive to give Bopara, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if such tea leaf, suggested that he will play this week end.
The buses bring people to work, and to fight against al Qaeda.
The first bus full of refugees from Syria obscures arrived in Baghdad yesterday, the exiles pouring money or visa renewals, or others who hope that the city has returned to normality.
Some have returned to fight against the militants who have far from home.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of bus terminal, the official government was full of refugees in Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I have decided to visit Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdas," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I returned today because I watched on TV and read in the newspapers what happened to Baghdâd and because the city is now safer."
"They say that the Mahdi Army will commit more crimes!" he said, referring to the militia's Shia militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who pushed his men to stay at the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a teacher Shia 38 years in the area of Amariyah dominated by the Sunni, returned with his two children, because he could not renew his visa because the Syrian regime prevents and obscures work.
Its neighbors Shia have called for Amariyah to inform him that the militia aided by the US, has allowed to hunt al-Qaeda to the west of the capital, and was invited to return.
One of the new arrivals of Jordan is the leader of a Sunni tribe and Shia who had to leave his home north of Baghdâd because of a grenade attack after he led people to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he should go to fight.
"two days ago, some of my friends called me and said they had established a Sleikh militia anti- Al-Qaeda to, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That is why I go today," said Sabaah Obeidi, Alu 62.
Many say they have attracted by the growing calm in the capital since American troops arrived, and in view of the continuing education of citizens' groups involved 'well armed and working with the American military to defend their neighbourhoods.
But still others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million have fled obscures the past.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years, father of three children, expressed suspicion felt by all about visas for exiles that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's government, the Shia, who has urged the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than 2.5 million people have fled the country because of the sectarian death squads.
"we had no problem until al-Maliki comes in Syria and urge the government to withhold visas obscures, forcing them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house when I left."
The decline of violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis have been driven out of areas of Shia and vice versa, creating places where tension has eased.
The fear that a sudden influx of refugees is new sectarian tensions and bring the fighting.
Small Sarre, good training.
The smallest state leads professional training, and even a conspicuous international orientation of its universities.
It is only in an area that a deficit lies on the sarrois, similar to the rest of the country.
"I have exliqué yesterday for the 50th time in a non-sarrois, that we are not the French" - the slogan that the smallest federated state, billboard self-mockery is something by its 50th anniversary.
At that level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of Saarland, which is placed fifth in the monitor training courses of the Institute of Cologne German economy.
Thus, already by tradition, universities cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in 1948 by the French Saarbrücken.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies by a double or triple degree.
Witness the quotitée high of 15.6 percent of foreign students.
The Sarre also led by the country's children graduate schools number above the average - many of them without a degree of Gymnasium.
"In Saarland, they benefit from training system," said Axel Plünnecke, an expert in training in IW.
More than one in five young student obtains his title in a vocational school, and Saarland running at more than seven points above the national average.
So the possibilities of combination of academic and vocational training are relatively well developed.
In view of the number of people, the panel of dual curriculum is the second best of Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, the number of graduated engineering has fallen by a third in the last few years.
That is why the Education Ministry has forced the sarrois to a marketing campaign in matters of science at the engineer.
"After the first studies PISA, we celebrated a lot of reforms in schools." general, said a spokesman for the Department of education.
So the government introduced across the state federated comparative tests.
As soon as children start to learn, the last year of crêche is free of right - a model that other state also parrot.
The future of comparative studies show that can improve the performance of students in a sustainable manner.
The PISA studies in 2003, the share of children at risk are reduced from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saar has not improved as much as other state.
The Bavarian fare better.
And, in spite of sarrois's foreign language knowledge are not measured by the PISA studies - if not win votes in this field.
Because the language of the neighbour is compulsory in the secondary schools - even if the French are not sarrois.
Chávez rule watches
In Venezuela, the tic-tac will soon watch other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will go back the clock half-an-hour in the South American country.
Chavez meanwhile is becoming a caricature in Spain.
As the official journal of Venezuela, the association was a new law, watches will be dealt with at least four hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American countries at a time zone which does not exist in any other state in the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position by the fact that the US would put the world separation of time zones in full hours.
Moreover, Chávez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with neighbouring Colombia, the fact of a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist Conservative announced that while the Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, there would be no relationship with the head of state, nor with the Colombian government.
"I can, already only because of my dignity," said Chávez who anxious constitutional reform on which the citizens of oil-producing countries will vote by referendum Sunday.
With this reform, it would considerably strengthen its power in the country.
The issue of this dispute was the decision to withdraw to Chávez Uribe's mandate for negotiations on the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would "spat in the face" with this decision, Venezuela's Chávez had criticized Sunday.
In Spain as Chávez is in all the pieces.
A new bells of mobile phone so great in the country: "Por callas" qué No. dann tais-tu (why do not) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded from the Internet.
It was ruled by King Juan Carlos of Spain, the most recent Ibero-American summit, was excited by the constant interruptions of leftist populists and who told him to shut up.
A wage reductions threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong performance, according to a prognosis, a real depreciation of the German wage earners threat this year.
Experts have cited for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect in 2007 to a real reduction in their pay slip over the previous year.
"The fault lies in low wage growth, increasing the value-added tax increases and the prices of food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for macroeconomics and research on the economy, "the newspaper Bild.
New charges could also rise in unemployment insurance for the employee.
The finance minister Peer Steinbrück said the 'Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung "that the expected drop in unemployment to 3.3 percent for the new year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
But the national employment agency to be embarrassed to ask the Federation of funds or financial aid, in the words of the SPD politician.
It was known Tuesday that the explosion of food prices and hydrocarbons had pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices rose 3.0 percent from year to year.

Despite its atmosphere hostile to life, Venus, Earth resembles more than what is believed to date: the European space probe Venus Express "discovered" thunder in the atmosphere and whirlpools of wind to poles, such as those that occur in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists assume that there are flashes on Venus.
The European probe Venus Express "has" demonstrated today - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: the flashes on Venus burst to a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud in cloud, reported Christopher Russell of the University of California at Los Angeles in the scientific journal "Nature".
According to this theory, the famous cyprine have shown flashes life on Earth: the storm would have stimulated ocean reactions that led to the formation of amino acids, cornerstone of life.
This is not the case: "If life on Venus, it must have been for a long time in history," writes Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington "".
There should be little things alive today to the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about 100 times more dense than on Earth, temperatures at 500 degrees.
"Venus is perhaps the twin circle of the earth, but it remains a twin," said Russell.
Why Venus, who are so close to the Earth in droves and dimensions, was hit by a different development, is also the fundamental issue of the mission ESA.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in vénusienne research, since no probe was underway for the exploration of this planet since the nineties.
In the opinion of researchers, the more research findings which have been presented in several articles of "Nature" point out not only the oddity of Venus in the solar system.
They also show that the similarities of our neighbouring planéte Earth is more than initially expected.
Thus, the researchers also found the swirls of wind already known to the North Pole, a swirl of clouds at the South Pole, who turns much faster.
The reminds phenomenon of land in the winter hemispheres, writing a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni Istituto di Astrofisica of the Italian Cosmica Spaziale e Fisica.
The second planéte of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12.100 kilometres, almost as large.
The planéte voting in the morning or evening star revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
It becomes much more slowly on itself: a day vénusien lasts 243 days earthlings.
Although Venus, with a surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and pressure from 92 bar, do not remember the Earth, scientists assume that the two planétes were formed in similar conditions.
Of the two, the water has accumulated and remained on the Earth in the form of oceans, but got lost in space on Venus.
And while the carbon dioxide has set on Earth in the form of carbonate, it is on Venus, most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends the meeting with the Dalai Lama to Merkel.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler calls for an end to the dispute between parties on the reception of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery.
In criticizing indirectly, the SPD on the attacks against the prime after the meeting in September.
The Federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and the grand coalition to settle the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not make the outside world a nation divided on this issue," said the Handelsblatt Köhler.
Similarly, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights are universally valid, although I have respect for the differences between cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a delicate balance in foreign policy, "said President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against accusations that it would convene a new policy of China.
The German Chancellor has not taken away with the traditional policy of one China.
"China knows," said Köhler.
The Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed its displeasure with the reception of the Dalai Lama and was attacked for it outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier particular complained of the "political" in front of the CDU in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery, virulent irritation became evident in germano-chinois reports.
Thus the Chinese government has not only cancelled German finance minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to the information Spiegel, has also frozen the strategic dialogue between foreign ministers of the two countries.
The leader of the government of China Wen Jiabao now requires allemmande Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the Dalai Lama's reception was a mistake.
China refuses that European politicians receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official duties, supported Wen Jiabao and the Chinese position.
The words and deeds of the Dalai Lama show that he is trying to separate China, Tibet and other Tibetan regiones, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against the riots like those of France.
Combats of street with police, fires, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against the riots like those of France.
Everything must be done to social discontent in Germany that broke out in the streets by violence, demanded the German Minister of Interior.
Some of the rioters burning barricades, who fire on the police with rifles: after the serious riots by young people in France, the Minister of Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) German fears of a similar change in Germany.
We must ensure that a contitue explosive is not a social Europe and to defuse the violence.
We must take this seriously, "said the" Neue Presse "appeared in Hanover.
All the young people were unable to cope with the rapid changes of social reality.
The Federation, the Länder and municipalities were already working with firmness to reduce the problems, said Schäuble.
It would not affect only the integration of immigrants.
"The summits of integrating the conferences on Islam, it shows already its first success."
But it would be too early to an end.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time that German suburbs, there are no problems or sociological Urban as in France.
In the northern Paris communities, young people have committed serious street battles with police during the last night.
In Toulouse, burned-out cars and public buildings.
More effort of integration from the German government demanded that the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Given the riots in France, Kolat warned that the "effects of imitation".
The situation in Germany is certainly not be so explosive that in France.
But it would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasizes the fact that the quota of young unemployed under 25 years from immigration is higher than the average.
We should primarily ensure more places for training.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective".
The President of Turkish communities, he suggested that social controls in families had more than in France in Germany.
Many young people from immigration does not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat urged: "But we must be careful."
We should "quickly give young people the opportunity to participate in the work and training".
Meanwhile, in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, remained very calm during the night.
The police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with the spotlight.
The authorities in office have made three arrests and few cars and dustbins burned.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1000 security forces ensures calm.
The police intervention was necessary, as long as the Minister of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after visiting the suburb.
In the night of Tuesday, nearly 80 policemen were injured during the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the next night, unrest flooded in Toulouse.
The riots éclatèrent after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the public prosecutor, the police is not responsible for the death of the young.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The entry of the utopian Chancellor shows that the coalition has finished with the bottom - and there is nothing to wait for it.
In what country is that the Chancellor?
After his intervention in the general debates afflicting the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor of content, we must say: here - not in the country who should ultimately be governed by it.
The accusation of focus too much on the policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel and a tough sentence presumptuous.
It is provincial, she said and has just shown that she does not understand the criticism.
In Parliament, it has made visible to all how this accusation was correct.
There was neither practical nor little interest in the problems of feelings of developed countries.
Instead, Angela ran like a cloud: a politician, who fled in weightlessness in foreign policy and even at approximating in the left.
For example: climate protection in this regard, it welcomes and yet still Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate objectives will be achieved in our country.
Even, praise yourself - have so little modesty, the leader of the CDU would have refused even two years ago.
Now it is clinging to ready-made formulae, that growth would affect people.
So it destroyed his image of pragmatist, which tackles problems rather than embellish the world.
But in the influence of cloud Angela, the problems of internal politics are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty among children and concerns workers?
He has a few sentences accessories for it.
In this regard is revealing the number of times it made the mistake when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to make a half sentence.
It is swaying in uncharted territory, when it becomes practical.
The branch Go get him
In the debate on the Youtube Republican presidential candidates, both Mitt and Rudy Giuliani favorite Romney engaged in an offensive battle - and must now fear a candidate outsider.
The tension erupts candidates already in the first issue.
It would have made New York a "safe haven" for illegal immigrants, Mitt Romney to criticize his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This against by heavy criticism: "I would say that his own house was a haven for illegal immigrants," says Giuliani accused the former governor of Massachusetts for employee undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are in the attack: as the Republican base there was also no official patronage, the eight presidential candidates in the debates on CNN used primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur films that Internet users are sent via Youtube much more than prompters.
"It is with this kind of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler came to power," engaging John McCain in his candidate Ron Paul who is the only up to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also is strongly lecture by the Vietnam War veterans, when he refuses to condemn torture as a so-called "Waterboarding", an interrogation technique that simulates drowning.
But the fact that the important themes of the campaign meanwhile go beyond the war in Iraq and debates on torture shows in the reactions of the ward of St. Petersburg in Florida.
Whether conservative values rented or that future increases in taxes to be refused, the applause surge in the auditorium.
There are again two where the shortcomings lie.
"I made a mistake at this time," writes Romney and contrite apology to the television and the public in 1994 to have been a supporter of abortion.
Giuliani instead spends in a bow flowing when asked his opinion on based on literalist interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf exists for the first time in civilian.
One day after his withdrawal as head of the armed man of Pakistani power, Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of domination by the army concludes.
The President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan has been invested Thursday for a new five-year mandate.
The Pakistani television has broadcast live the ceremony at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has vowed to respect the Constitution and the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday he had sent his charge of army commander Ashfaq Kiyani in his confidant and was so bent on international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless coup, the former General is now for the first time as head of marital status.
For the withdrawal of the post of commander-in-chief, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the emergency rule that Musharraf had ruled on November 3.
Already shortly after his investiture Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to the Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and so will meet another requirement of the West.
The Supreme Court, the country that Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of a state of emergency with lawyers from its ranks last week, had rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the Chief of the October 6.
Meanwhile five soldiers were killed in the North Waziristan tribal region in the north in an attack on a military convoy, and four others injured.
According to the spokesman of the army, a bomb exploded in a street near the border of Afghanistan.
The fathers of Krautrock are returning.
The supergroupes of Germany in the 1970s play again: the three members of the Harmonia Group again seized their neck in a concert in Berlin.
To return appeared recordings of their great success "Live 1974".
Even then, they were well known abroad.
The planned happens then sensation in the form of three men announced at the poster of the night.
Everyone has his small wobbles before him, his cable and above all its spots.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a white shirt like snow.
It is flanked to the left of Michael Rother, young of 57 years and in possession of a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, observed by all the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is on his neck curve.
Each contributes to noise, including even a Beat.
And sometimes it inadvertently top a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem too upset the people themselves.
The fact that the group of new Harmonia plays assured some agitation among Krautrock fans.
It is entitled to disclose here: targeted polls show that the name is in the collective memory of the pop, but in any case of sustainable manner so that this group is also painfully for 32 years.
But why German might not have the right to celebrate his living legends in the 1970s?
Moreover, what is misleadingly called "Krautrock" has always liked England and more in America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry has awarded the prize in 2003 Echo to survivors of the Group of Cologne Can for their work, we saw in the German pop faces interrogators.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers groups have also thanked the Neu! in Düsseldorf praise eulogy, the surprise was limitless.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the scene of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance among themselves and the transfiguration into the unknown is the only.
The memory is already taken by Harmonia, because the trio has existed for two years and that during this period, the power to impact was felt was much lower than it was given by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the name of very promising Cluster.
The first played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother was briefly repaired in minister refers Kraftwerk and had finally made a name as guitarist with Neu!, then perhaps the most radical German group.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster, in exile in the fôrets of Weserbergland.
Here, in a former Weser, a firm ruined the 16th century, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less than in the ideological community "Kommune I", where Roedelius had the right to torment as a nanny.
Rather an existence in the way of artistic Spitzweg.
Allegedly was in the garbage a pennant and a Ottenstein Harmonia as a name for the art.
Many Harmonia hired away from it.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia" and the "Luxe" The following.
For too low that sounded calm and music, the group suffered physical misery.
The dead wood crop was not alone in search of itself.
The CD "Live 1974" has been appearing at a concert in Griessem before a public record of nearly 50 heads, as well as anyone thinks remember.
Rother issued at this time the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was a requirement for Roedelius Moebius and immoral.
The group announced his separation in 1975.
Rother atterit in the spheres of esotericism and ensured its existence with books like "Flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster is réanima in the 1980s and has been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
We must Live album of Griessem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His Grönland label has set the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been unearthed out as the Roedelius staff.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia at the Maison of world cultures in Berlin.
Subventionné publicly, in the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is, the former British punk, and author of the paperback "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
For the whole of the fluctuation band of the influence of Krautrock would be focused on the future pop.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
The sentence of Brian Eno hanging in the room in the middle of sounds singulars: "The only real music, you listen to the future".
There are pictures that show producers in the room with Harmonia.
Projections other black-and-white pictures bazaar cable tools used in the training of the legend.
Facing, the three veterans are again busy improvize.
But more by sticking to the organ of microphones and the battery, to draw the instruments of sounds unbelievable through the instruments in effect built yourself.
Today, electronic music like electronic music.
The three major meticulous workers in technology.
In that even the choir of the house will not help.
Led by Barbara Morgenstern, coughs and whispers under the cloud of sounds, and it sings at an extraordinary moment "Aaaaaaaah" emphatically.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never a rock.
The roots were less sought in the blues in the music academies (Can), technology (minister refers Kraftwerk) or in the flight of artistic conventions or social (Cluster).
Anyone who shouts "68" was not totally wrong, and now Harmonia also gets more annoyed by it now.
But what is the most obvious will be covered carefully on the scene.
Where the music begins and where does it stop?
This can slap the nerves of someone (?) or give moments of joy closes quickly.
Richard Gere simply is not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Peace," two films murderous approach to new Balkan war.
But both are not convincing.
Either the projects are based too on the action and on the exchange of senseless shootings in fact they are too weeping.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" cannot help.
The good news: the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is in the hinterland, most lugubrious of the war in Bosnia, because the actor Richard Gere is then recovered.
We had finally lost sight of the best man from the 1980s, because too many gentillets and futils roles in films to feelings for women and too many press conferences on the subject Buddhism was delighted to be.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important point to consider "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why today's films should be as long and confusing that collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
It gives a splendid portrayal of clins full of eye: basically his character of war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if destiny and the film industry were not as tolerant: a man who has his best moments long behind him, but who, even as a monument to ruin his decline, has kept the visible remnants of its former charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with German production murderous "Peace," as this week, the more failed films on the Balkan war.
The murderous "Peace" can be done quickly the trial: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), a ground-breaking of Kosovar Serb irregulars, in which one of the two promptly falls in love again.
While it is welcome that the Serbs are here for once not presented as the only cause of all evil, the film as flat as a TV movie goes too quickly into action and exchanges of senseless shootings.
This is a kind of "Cobra" Alarme for 11 with a war without motorway but instead.
On the contrary, we can look in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why basically there has never been a real good film on the Balkan war.
The history of three American war reporters, to seek to determine the top war criminal, "the fox" could perhaps become, with another producer and another scriptwriter (both both Richard Shephard wrote another), a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males are in small team in the forest, to do something that the military cannot be male and two, it becomes a trip to the madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that it does not simply be the cynical deserted Simon Hunt with a heart, as it is before the beginning.
No, the script must confer a romantic adventure with a top Bosnia assassinated thereafter.
Then "The Hunting Party" is really bad, when the reporter, in the space of five minutes, through an accelerated process succeeds in NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have not succeeded in five years: catch the war criminal and allow for a fair revenge for Bosnian Muslims.
This is so bad that we should seize the International Court of the Hague of crime against the film logic.
In this case, the film is too deep human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and we suspect the Americans and the French (here they must be exceptionally agree) not to drive hunting fairly closely because of secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and bad are this time so that a similar Brecht's famous poême comes to mind.
Those talks wooden masks a demon Asia on the table for work of particular poet: "Compatissant, I see the veins of hot front, clear: as is straining to be nasty."
The films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such head tumescentes, but that implies how it is straining to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of film on the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in the newspaper that all Hollywood movies on Iraq were big flops.
You can add: there has never been of good films on South Africa.
What is true whenever: when a star drags on a hotbed of crisis or on a minefield, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie "or" Blutdiamanten "with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still too close in time.
Nevertheless, decades have always gone before Hollywood can turn a good film on the Holocaust with "The list of" Schindler.
Some films are even mature - those who are today of classical works on Vietnam, "The Deer Hunter" "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated unanimously at their time as labor leaders.
But perhaps we know today as simply too on conflicts of the world, where each hecatomb can live on two screens at the same time,
And it delighted to scriptwriters the unscrupulous they need for stories of good stories.
"To be, or not to be" or "The dictator" are in fact become as good because Lubtisch and Chaplin do not yet know how the Nazi regime really dominated.
Perhaps we should not be good if we want to make good flims.
Perhaps we have the speed of light and artistic sarcastic novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was questioned on the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière" and Dictionnaire of the Balkan war, he replied: "It is up to the fact that some things never change."
"The big cities are still horribly dangerous, men will always murdered a horrifying event and the war still prevails in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust crop criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The mayor of hindsight with the candidacy of Hamburg for the summer Olympics ran in politics and the economy to strong criticism.
Many want to continue to fight for the Games on the edge of the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in assessing the chances.
The main director of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described Wednesday as "a" bad for the local economy.
These days, no other project had been as motivated forces in the city that the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this goal, the momentum politico-sportif could not be kept in the same measures".
Schmidt-Trenz urge the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point in the longer term, "which takes as its starting point a new agenda changed".
The mayor Ole von Beust, died Wednesday at his previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions were unrealistic to Hamburg at least until the year 2028.
"It is not Hamburg who decides to apply the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympic sports," said Von Beust at WELT ONLINE.
He is referring to the expected decision of the Sports Federation early December, on the candidature of Munich for the Winter Games in 2018.
This means that we, preferably in the time that we had planned until 2028 until now, we have no chance. "
But the dream is not firmly in the past, von Beust said.
The Sports Federation of Hamburg (HSB) regretted the statements of Beust.
In this would be given the impression that Hamburg will not apply to the Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now," said Wednesday President of HSB Günter Ploß.
A collapse of the candidacy would be more at odds with the leader of the Senate at the reception in plenary meeting of the German Federation of universities of sport.
The Von Beust would have referred to the candidacy of Hamburg University games of 2015 as being "not a substitute" the Olympics in Hamburg.
The Federation of universities of sport was first in the weeks nominated Hamburg as a candidate city.
The fraction of the SPD mayor criticized the Senate for not having used this time in housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Little Grasbrook has been rejected by the Senate for years because he has played the card of the Olympics and has excluded the construction of housing," said the SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for an integrated plan Grasbrook Hansel in the Olympics and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event factor".
The candidacy for the Summer Olympics in 2012 would be raised to Hamburg for a great enthusiasm.
Hamburg, however, was broken against Leipzig.
These are not Warhols unions.
Anyone who joins the concepts and wooden fund Swedish Ikea, but not to think of Andy Warhol.
Or if?
Currently, wooden crates manufactured in Sweden cast shadows on the list of works of Warhol.
Much of "Type Brillo-Boxs ninety" listed there are Stockholm contrefaÇons.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" has questioned a few months the authenticity of Brillo-Boxs 1968 to Andy Warhol, the internal investigation of the Moderna Stockholm Museet today to lead a désenchanteur outcome: the six "Brillo-Boxes", whose former director of the museum's gift Pontus Hulten in 1995 to Moderna Museet, are copies - and a lot of other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of Stockholm, "Type" on the international market.
The past history is entangled, a chain of artistic productions disconcerting and curatoriques.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York its first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden crates, based on the rouge-bleu-blanc design cartons of soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his work in Moderna Museet introduced in 1968, with the agreement of Warhol - hundreds of Brillo made of cardboard boxes: They did not (for financial reasons) of Warhol, but had been directly delivered to the Brillo linerboard mill.
It was not here of works of art, but rather of their models, samples of exposure.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce a wooden crates Brillo in Sweden, who were not exposed to Museet Moderna.
Witnesses from the time talking today about 15 wooden crates were at the time in the history of art and auction, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Wahrol allowed, with the "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have achieved in auctions more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem now is that the legendary director Pontus Hultén said the museum mistakenly later that approximately 100 wooden crates were produced and explained in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol was then transferred.
Indeed, the 105 cases of Hultén were produced in Malmö in 1990 alone, for a man exposure.
At that time, Warhol was already dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief of the Conservative Moderna Museet, examined, alongside the museum of six Brillo-Boxes, three other private collections, including two suedoises were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and sanded, then we had a brush with the white oil paint.
The texture copies dating from 1990 reveals that the painting was directly applied without substantive layer signposts laminates, using a paint roller - it is not an oil paint, but a acrylic.
"These funds have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of" Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol, director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the European Andy Warhol Art in New York Authentication Board not another decision, the Moderna Museet will file the six cases in his collection as copies / display material."
Back in July, the Authentication Board has announced that he would investigate the "serious charges" to be raised in the case of powdered soapboxes.
But since there is a halo inéxorable silence.
The rebel soldiers out of Manila
In the Philippines, fled, rebel soldiers who had taken shelter in a hotel in Manila, which had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The Leader Antonio Trillanes, who criticized President corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel he cannot respond to any bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to power had little before attacked the hotel with tear gas.

"We call on people to join us."
The General Danilo Lim, who commanded a unit of elites before the Scouts Rangers, said that other units of the army would soon join the march.
Critics of the regime had called for a large demonstration against President Wednesday.
His government is surrounded for months by charges of corruption.
The finance district of Manila since 2003 was the scene of the attempted mutiny by about 200 members of the army against Arroyo.
The brisa insurgency is nearly 24 hours after the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempted coup against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
