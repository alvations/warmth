A republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The republican leaders justified their policy by the need for fighting against the electoral fraud.
However, the Center Brennan regards the latter as a myth, affirming that the electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by the lightning.
Moreover, the republican lawyers listed only 300 cases of fraud electoral in the United States in ten years.
A thing is certain: these new provisions will influence rate of participation negatively.
In this direction, these measurements will undermine the American democratic system partly.
Contrary to Canada, the American States are responsible for the organization of the federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of US governments promulgated starting from 2009 new laws making more difficult the process of registration or vote.
This phenomenon gained in importance after the elections of November 2010 which transfer to be added 675 new republican representatives in 26 States.
Consequently, 180 government bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced during the only year of 2011.
The new electoral laws require that the voters present an identity card with photograph and a proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce also the periods of advance voting, invalidate the right to be registered like voter the day of the poll and withdraw with the citizens having a legal file their right to vote.
Before the elections of 2006, no American State required voters to present an identity card with photograph.
Indiana was the first State to establish such a requirement.
The Supreme court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The republican authorities hastened to extend this practice in other States.
During two last years, they sponsored government bills in 34 States to force the voters to present an identity card with photograph.
It is important to note that, contrary to Quebec, the American citizens do not have universal identity card like the chart of the health insurance.
In fact, 11% of the American citizens, are 21 million people in age to vote, do not have identity cards with photograph emitted by a governmental agency of their State.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 does not have such identification papers.
However, it costs some often more than one hundred dollars to obtain the necessary identity card.
The new restrictions assign in a disproportionate way the young people, the minorities, and the people with low-income.
Indeed, 25% of the Afro-Americans, 15% of the people gaining less than 35,000 dollars; 18% of the citizens of more than 65 years and 20% of the voters from 18 to 29 years do not have the necessary identity card with photograph.
Much more.
The students, of the voters considered as voter more for the democratic candidates, are not authorized in several States to use their identity card with photograph emitted by their institution.
On the other hand, these same States authorize the members of the clubs of peaches or hunting which vote more on the republican side to use to vote the cards emitted by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen States adopted laws requiring of the voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measurements clearly aim at limiting the Hispanic vote.
However, it Appert whom two Hispanic voters out of three support the democratic party.
In addition, the republican legislators sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing the registration of the voters the day of the poll in eight States.
Moreover, they limited the right of people and groups to provide an assistance to the voters wishing to be registered.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, at the time of the general election of 2004, the registration campaigns of the voters contributed to record approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 made fall of 17% the rate of registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
Moreover, the republican legislators adopted laws in five other States aiming at reducing the period of advance voting.
For example, at the time of the general election of 2008 in Florida, 33% of the voters who have advance voting were Afro-Americans, whereas the latter accounted for only 13% of the voters of the State.
The same applied with the Hispanic ones.
Those accounted for only 11% from the voters, but 24% citizens who voted by anticipation.
On the other hand, the white which formed 76% of the voters accounted for only 46% of the voters voter by anticipation.
Of course the democratic legislators and their supporters opposed the adoption of laws vigorously restricting the registration of the voters.
Several government bills were blocked by the vetoes of the democratic governors.
The prosecuting attorney of the United States intervened to suspend the most discussed laws.
They could limit the damage partly.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States adopted laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with photograph.
Nevertheless, the new rules installation unquestionably will make more difficult the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
The democratic critics denounce the character in favour of the laws which were voted and they see an obvious objective there to influence the results in 2012 in key States.
A report of the Center Brennan of 2011 shows that the States which adopted these laws account for 171 of the 270 votes necessary to the electoral college to gain the presidency.
It is too early to affirm with certainty that these legislative modifications on the level of the electoral system will have significant impacts on the result of the presidential elections of 2012.
But a thing is certain: these new provisions will influence rate of participation negatively.
In this direction, these measurements will undermine the American democratic system partly.
Tracking of the cancer of the prostate: to pass the test or not?
Indeed, the test of STEP would have sometimes erroneous results, with false negative results or of false-positives, which involve useless medical interventions.
What to make hesitate even more the already reticent men to pass from the screening tests.
To pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted to the United States, there was much contamination between the reference groups, it is thus difficult to interpret these data and to have firm recommendations.
Another study, that one European, concluded with a difference in mortality between the patients who had a tracking and those which did not have of it.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, which one has between 30 and 40% of more than chances to have metastases if one is not detected.
I thus recommend the test as from 50 years, or 40 years if one has a direct relative who already had a cancer of the prostate.
The men of origin Afro-American are also more at the risk.
The key is to once make the good decision one detected a cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others which are indolent.
It is really necessary to render comprehensible with the patient the degree of risk of its cancer, by offering the possible options to him, by not treating necessarily cancers of the prostate which do not carry not reached to the long-term life, and while choosing rather, in these cases, for an active monitoring of the disease.
Today, much of men at whom one detects a cancer will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their life.
One will suggest to them making active monitoring and if the disease progresses, one will offer a treatment to them.
More and more, one determines with precision of the criteria to decide which would have or should not be treated.
I thus recommend nevertheless to pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with its doctor to determine if one should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the international Company of urology, Movember created a tool which makes it possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the test of STEP.

To prevent the disease
There does not exist unfortunately miraculous formula to prevent cancer.
In spite of progress of research, the adoption of good practices of life remains the best means of reducing the risks to suffer from it.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently, one could prevent 30% of cancers.
“So nobody any more smoked, this rate would climb to at least 50%”, underlines André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Company of cancer.
On the other hand, one evaluates that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several remain also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Company of cancer, the fight against the tobacco addiction remains a priority, in spite of the reduction amongst smokers.
The cigarette is related to 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It constitutes also a risk factor for several others.
That harms the health of people enormously.
“Still today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec”, the spokesperson André Beaulieu regrets.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, the risk to die of a cancer falls of half.
The weight
The plumpness and obesity support also the appearance of the disease, according to the SCC.
They would increase the risks of cancer of the centre, the colon and the rectum, the oesophagus, the pancreas and the uterus.
“Research shows that the regular practice of the physical-activity during a whole life protects from cancer from the colon”, one adds.
Food
The organization also recommends to limit its consumption of red meat.
In too great quantity, it makes climb the risks to be reached of a cancer colorectal.
Pork-butcheries also, and they should be avoided.
The conservation of the meat by manuring, drying or salting can involve the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“These last can damage the cells of the organization and lead to the development of cancer”, one explains.
Vitamins
During last years, several scientists studied the bonds between the vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research is not however conclusive for the moment.
Studies on the vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
Whereas one of them noted a reduction in the risks of cancer of the prostate, another an increase noted rather.
The effect of the vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established either.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance of speaking about his concerns and his family antecedents with his doctor.
“To pass a screening test, that does not give cancer.”
The boson of peeled Higgs
The announcement of the probable discovery of boson of Higgs created a whole agitation, last summer, and due.
That this boson takes part in the mechanism responsible for the mass of any thing in the Universe, only that is indeed believed.
And then, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard Model - our the best, or “less worse” explanation of nature and the behavior the matter - but which was not observed yet empirically.
But for the physicists, it is not yet completely sure that it is indeed Higgs.
One knows without the shade of a doubt that one holds an authentic news particle, and that it resembles much boson of Higgs predicted by the standard Model.
Moreover, of new revealed data this week at the time of a great congress of physics, in Kyoto, seem to confirm it, but it still misses data to be perfectly certain about it.
Let us suppose all the same that it is indeed Higgs, since the chances to be mistaken seem mean, and see what it acts.
There is, in this low world, a law fatally impossible to circumvent wanting that two things cannot be found at the same place at the same time.
Not average to infringe this rule - and, you do not test too extremely will hurt yourselves.
However even if the physics of the particles is a quite strange world, it proves that it has also a law of this kind: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, who stipulates that two particles cannot occupy same space at the same time if they are in the same “quantum state” - this “state” consisting roughly speaking of some their characteristics.
From there, the physicists classify the particles in two categories.
In a corner, one finds good citizens named fermions, which obey the principle of Pauli wisely.
And in the other are agitated the bosons, a dirty band of anarchists who do not admire nothing - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can indeed be at the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are divided then into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, moreover) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not approach here, and “particles of force”, by which the great forces of the nature are propagated and to which the boson of Higgs would be to some extent related.
These bosons, it should it be underlined here, are not all of the small beasts as exotic as one could believe it.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the “particle of light” which is the “messenger” of the electromagnetic force.
When, indeed, a particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, that “disturbs” the electromagnetic field in this precise place, a little like a stone launched in a pond.
This “disturbance” is born an electromagnetic wave (from the light, or infra-red, or of the ultra-violet, etc), and this wave is anything else only one photon - and thus, one of bosons “carrying force”.
More stable field
The same applies with boson of Higgs, with this difference close it is another field, the field of Higgs, who must be “disturbed” so that this boson appears.
However, this field of Higgs is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to reach very, very high energies, a little as if it were about a cold pond whose only very large rock could wrinkle surface.
This is why one needs an immense particle accelerator as that of the CERN - the Broad Collider High-energy particle is a ring of 27 km circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between Higgs and the mass.
They are indeed not all the particles, nor all the materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the magnets, do it, but others not - a bit of paper, for example, will never hold of itself on a fridge.
And in the same way, in fact the particles interact with the field of Higgs: those which do it have a mass, whereas the others (like the photon, hold) do not have any.
Now, what “can bring” all this research, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, that is used to check the validity of the standard Model (ms), and that also makes it possible to the physicists to scan any difference between the observations and the predictions of the ms.
They are besides several to ardently wish that one find some, because the least difference could open a door on a “new physics” and stop certain holes of the Model.
This one, it should be said, still has enormous deficiencies, not proposing any explanation for the gravity (oops!) or the dark matter, which forms approximately 80% of the matter of the Universe (Re-oops!).
But one did not find such variations to the CERN until now.
Repercussions
The repercussions of this research in the daily newspaper of Mister and Mrs All-the-World, they, are more difficult to predict, but one would be wrong to suppose that there will not be.
Hold: with the whole beginning of the Sixties, the pionniers of the laser, in the Laboratories Beautiful, by no means suspected the revolution which their work was going to start.
They foresaw of it scientific applications, but anything moreover.
In fact, already said us to fire the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed itself the first continuous laser (the first were pulsated), in 1962 -, at the beginning the laser was rather seen like a “gadget of laboratory”.
Imagine…
And then, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation which surrounds research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small sensor of light in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although it was not at all its original intention, serves now as “eye” with all the digital cameras of the world, and the Nobel of physique 2009 was worth to him.
That does not want of course to say that the activities of the LHC necessarily will transform our lives, but that means that, really, one never knows…
Palliative care - the best way of dying… | The Duty
With its Commission to die in dignity, Quebec recently discussed delicate question of the end of the lifetime.
The debate must begin again soon whereas a government bill prepares.
However, in this essential field, much remains to be made.
The Duty tried to look at there more closely.
A few weeks ago hardly, Mr L. lived still alone in its apartment of Montérégie.
The cancer of the prostate which corroded it had left him a two years respite.
“They had given me five years to be lived, I made seven years”, he says, mid--fig mid--grape, lengthened in his bed at the house of palliative care Victor-Gadbois, of Beloeil, where it arrived the day before.
“But it is always a shock, one cannot be prepared with that”, he says.
The disease makes its work: a weakness enormous which it prevented only going to the toilets, and even from only eating.
Sat at table in front of an appetizing lunch, it agrees to be let help to eat, resigned.
Courageous, it arrives even at smiling, speaks with the unknown ones which was affairent around him, bring its drugs to him, offer a bath to him.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My greater wish, it is that me am cured diarrhoea, it is humiliating”, he entrusts.
A few hours later, L " equips found a remedy for this evil.
“During our life, one learns that a man, that pisses upright”, Pierre Brodeur tells, psychologist at the house Victor-Gadbois.
To regress at the stage of the child, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“That depends on the capacity of the person” to accept the regression, he notes.
Because, of the opinion of several people working in palliative care, of great moments are held in the middle same of this regression.
The patients who enter to the house of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer all from cancer.
They have three months a maximum forecast of life.
At this stage, L " equips doctors and nurses who surrounds them does not lavish any more a care known as “curative”.
For Mrs. the A., 89 years, worst feared is to die “conscious and choked”.
But the disease made me discover my children.
“I have good children”, she adds.
“I do not have any more wishes in the life”, she says, before accepting that one poses a mask to him to help it to breathe.
It expects all the same, in the next days, a last visit of her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, one lavishes, with a group of voluntary, the care of the body and the assistance with the food.
These are the palliative care, that one gives when there is no more anything else to make.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, one counts a bed of palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little when it is known that one ends all up dying one day.
Here, the life continues under the best conditions possible, explains Dre Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
That it is on the level of physical comfort, emotive or spiritual.
With dying, one will agree to lavish care of mouth to the brandy or Pepsi, according to the request.
The diabétiques ones will not be held any more to control their sugar rate.
And death is part of the daily newspaper.
Yesterday evening, one was used a beer for Mr. X, deceased during the night.
This morning, it is his/her son who will finish beer with the feet of the late one.
“One helps the close relations as much as the patients”, Nathalie Savard, director of the care tells.
To the house Victor-Gadbois, the days are followed but do not resemble.
In the sides of old a 93 year old man who enjoys his last assembly of family in the court, fixed well in his pillows while one clinks glasses in his honor, a 36 year old young man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having very tried to survive.
“For six months, there has been always from three to five beds which are occupied by old cancer patients of less than 45 years”, Dre Christiane Martel worries.
53% of the patients who are allowed at the house Victor-Gadbois arrive of their residence, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to the palliative care
One says that 77% of the Canadians do not have quite simply access to palliative care, i.e. to care conceived to alleviate the suffering when a patient arrived at the final phase of his life, that it is in residence, the hospital or in house of care.
And several organizations, like the house Victor-Gadbois and the Company of palliative care in residence of Large Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to the cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in the Québécois health care which makes fear with several doctors specialized in palliative care the adoption of a law framing the euthanasia and the assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed celebrities of the palliative care whose Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulate to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dre Christiane Martel, the Québécois health care system is not enough powerful to ensure that each one will be entitled to palliative care of quality before one agrees to proceed to the euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient spending 14 days to the urgency, in great pains, without one doing what is necessary to relieve it.
I fear that patients ask to die only because they receive the adequate care.
And in parallel, several oncologists bait themselves on their patients until the last day, in spite of the worst forecasts.
The hopes of survival of Hélène Richard were already tiny when it gave up a testing chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncologist that I stopped the treatment, she answered me that she regretted that I stop beating me, she told.
However, she had told me that J " stays finished!
Pas des care the Almightyes
Dre Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask to die thank looking after them not to have reached their request after they were relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care.
But it should well be said that the palliative care is not absolutely the Almightyes in the treatment of the pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of the palliative care at the Company of palliative care in residence of Large Montreal, the patients would be refractory with the treatments against the pain in 8% of the cases.
At the any end of the lifetime, the doctors then resort often to the palliative sedation, which amounts deadening the patient until the moment of his death, either in a sporadic way, or in a permanent way.
One cannot make pretence any more not hear this part of the suffering.
More and more, the patient not relieved will have the possibility of having this palliative sedation.
The patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: “I want to die. ”
But that does not want to necessarily say “I want that you put down me”, that wants to say “I want to be relieved”.
The realization of this report was made possible thanks to a purse of journalism of the Research institutes in health of Canada.
Real scandals of great width in Quebec
Civils servant of the roadway system, entrepreneurs of the BTP, raisers funds of political parties and specialists in the Mafia Italian tell day after day what they know of formidable “a system”, mixing building industry, civils servant, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
A “industry” which cost very expensive the Québécois taxpayers, especially in the years 1990 and 2000.
“They is curious as the system is exhausted since one took the great ways”, is ironical Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former chief of police of Montreal.
It is by him that the scandal is burst in 2011, by the means of a basic investigation into the embezzlements related to the road work contracts in Quebec, to which the first liberal minister for the time, Jean Charest, had not authorized that with move back.
The “Duchesneau report” drew up a direct link between industry, secret funding of parties and bribery of a public official.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he underlines, the only ministry for transport would have saved a billion dollar on the contracts”, some holding back their instincts to touch a quota!
The Charbonneau Commission “already made fall two mayors”, he adds, by hoping that she manages “to show the stratagems behind the individuals”.
A permanent unit anti-corruption, created in 2011
The permanent Unit anti-corruption, created in 2011, is also harnessed there with its army of inspectors, investigators and analysts of the government.
More the police officers of “the squad Hammer” who, since 2009, would have led the “cartel of the sewers” of Montreal to put the soft pedal on swellings of contracts…
These last weeks, it proceeded to searches in series and carried charges for fraud and corruption against elected local officials, like Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban town.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned of his post of mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec.
It is suspected of having pocketed of the bribes with repetition in return for public contracts.
Are formally in addition marked of the engineers to the roadway system of Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, of which Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
This last created sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the “system” of obtaining public contracts.
Itself poured during years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal with an intermediary related to the Mafia which transferred the money with Montreal Union, the party of the mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito sowed with all winds in the years 2000, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially with the liberals then with the power.
He also acknowledged to have organized a collection of illegal funds for the ex-vice-first minister liberal, Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts of sewers of which it inflated the costs
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption functioned roundly.
Gilles Surprenant, ex-engineer in public works, detailed it well before the commission: in ten years, it received building firms gifts, invitations with travel, tournaments of golf, restaurants, matches of hockey and bribes adding up 736,000 dollars, in return for contracts of sewers of which it inflated the costs.
Other civils servant of the roadway system acknowledged to be themselves made lubricate the leg by inflating from 30% to 40% the invoices, by forgery will extras.
Then an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, showed Mr. Tremblay to have deliberately closed the eyes on a parallel budget feeding his cases with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, plunging Montreal in a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected of Montreal to draw the alarm bell.
Mayor of the district of River-of-Meadows, east of the island, it rises by 2010 against the sale of a municipal ground bought 5 million dollars and resold… 1.6 million with promoters, in full real boom.
dirty money 70% in the electoral campaigns
Investigation which will be finally installation, it says that it “draws on a wire making it possible to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop causes to become gangrenous it and to pin the faulty ones”.
The process, she says, is “painful but positive”.
One is cleaning the wound but one would need a survey unit specific to Montreal and a day before, not to see returning the doubtful practices.
Like one does the housework.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on his side that “civils servant flew of the hundreds of million dollars”, but worries especially about the role of “elected officials to the current of the stratagem”, when they did not soak in the chicanery!
Estimating at 70% the dirty money share in the financing of the electoral campaigns in Quebec, he is ironical: “It was told me that it was only one pale reflection of reality.”
The Québécois government proposes to limit to 100 dollars the gifts with the parties but that will not change gives it, according to him: “As long as the electoral expenditure strictly will not be limited, there will be dirty money in policy.”
He preach a complete revision of the system of granting of public contracts and party financing: “One cannot go low; to go at the bottom as of things, with courage, will make it possible to rebuild the house on more solid bases, with more controls and of laws.”
If this history tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those which laugh at it to look in their own court…
“the PSG is not the FC Barcelona!”
This season, you took a new scale with the PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
One can explain it by an individual awakening but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Large players arrived.
Each day, I progress to their side.
Technical staff brought me also much.
With the daily newspaper, these elements push me to hoist my level of game.
And, in match, it is easier.
All goes very quickly in football.
But I do not ignite.
Of my beginnings to the center of preformation of the INF Clairefontaine to my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by stages.
You thus benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti…
The recruits of this summer are accustomed to dispute matches of high level very.
They also know that each training is crucial.
With the result that a player as me desire has for coping and to provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings to me much as for my positioning.
It is shouldered by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played same station as me.
Is Ancelotti the right man for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires the respect in all the technicians.
Today, it does not have the equal one Leagues of them 1 and belonged to the best European trainers.
It has great experience and gained many titles with crested clubs.
It mixed with large players.
I think that it will gain other titles in Paris.
In January, I had had a discussion comforting with him.
I left a series of wounds then.
Confidence that it grants to me explains also my performances.
Which glance do you relate to the first part of season of the PSG?
In League 1, Lyon took the place of leader to us.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our major targets is the League of the champions: we qualified ourselves for the 8es of finale with the manner.
Which is the objective of the club in this competition?
One will try to go possible further.
From now on, all can arrive.
But there will be our word to say vis-a-vis very good European teams.
We want initially to finish first of our hen, in front of Oporto, to be able to receive at the time of 8th from finale return.
Can the PSG become a large European club in the short run?
It has of it already the budget…
To become a large European club, Paris needs to gain titles and to fall under the duration.
Today, it is not the case.
Financially, the PSG gives itself means so that this project is concretized.
In would League 1, not to gain the title, like last season, be a large failure?
Of course, that would represent a large disappointment.
This year, one has really in heart to pocket this championship.
Last season, one did not pass far.
In May, there was disappointment because there were qualities to finish first.
One made a very large season.
One finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, one is supposed being champion…
But another team, Montpellier, carried out one season even more fantastic.
This year, I think that it is the good one.
Even if the large teams like Marseilles, Lyon or Bordeaux are with the fight for the title, I think that one has the weapons to carry it.
Do you estimate that the media expect too much the PSG?
It is normal that many us are expected within sight of what were invested and of the players that one A.
It completely is accepted.
Afterwards, when one gains 4-0 in residence against Troyes and that one still finds things to be reproached to us, it is sure that it is a little frustrating.
One wonders what people await from more.
One will be able to never gain 4-0 every weekend.
One is not the FC Barcelona!
One tries to set up a project of game.
A team builds itself with time.
One proved in League champions that one could answer present.
Have looked at Manchester City which does not arrive, for two seasons, to qualify itself for the 8es of finale, they also made enormous expenditure!
With the glance as of invested sums, one imagined you with 15 points in advance with the truce!
It was to neglect our adversaries and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseilles, which were not well last season, “were boosted” by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is enthralling.
I hope that in May we will be able to have the smile by telling us that, despite everything the difficulties, one ended up carrying it.
The PSG seems completely depend on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
As well better as one says as there is a “Zlatan dependence”.
That wants to say that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and that it puts many goals.
It came for that and it proves that he is the star of League 1.
It showed everywhere where it passed that he was a large player, a star world.
Within the group, one respects the man and the player.
Also respects the men whom it has around him.
What it has fact is really exceptional.
That pushes the others to hoist their level of game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders of the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I had in heart to take part in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my wound prevented me grappiller of the time of game.
I saw things over there and I left there reinforced.
Today, I manage to carry out good matches in selection.
It is what I hoped for since my baptism with the Blue ones.
One learned the lessons from what occurred to Ukraine and one must have an exemplary behavior today.
Which glance do you relate to the first months of Didier Deschamps in charge of the Blue ones?
It has the results for him.
One is well placed in the qualifier group for the World one.
The sport selector is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires gains it.
As was to it Laurent Blanc.
But I do not want to make comparison.
White had achieved its goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blue ones to Brazil.
Does the null good (1-1) snatch, on October 16th, in Spain constitute a match founder?
This match gave us confidence.
Each one fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never lived on similar match in my career.
With Bitcoin, to pay and sell without the banks
All the opposite of the current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and expenses of treatment enters the recipients.
Moreover, like often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made banking monopolies, led to the financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros…) and a protocol of exchange made safe in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the file-swapping of par par.
Approximately 200,000 transactions were already recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand of Web sites accept the bitcoins like gifts or means of payment.
The course of the bitcoin, after having reached a top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell with 2 dollars, five months later, before returning today around ten dollars (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world exchanges in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central bank (ECB) was interested there in a report on the virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin like “the currency virtual having the most success”, “competing with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin is distinguished from other types of virtual currency like the “appropriations”, used to progress in a video game which one gains while playing or which one can buy (and sometimes to exchange in return).
The Facebook social network also developed this kind of system.
But, each time, a central authority controls and treats the exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all the nodes of the network are at the same time agents of the book of accounts, inspectors, transmitters of currency, and purchasers and salesmen.
How does this network function?
Each transaction between two users is actually done between two email addresses in the manner of e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of related information with this transaction is signed electronically by a system of coding to double key.
The network can thus check the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is as possible to make sure as the exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public book of accounts, diffused in all the network.
The stage-key consists in writing this new transaction in this book.
It passes by the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to the computers, and whose winner, left provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add this additional line.
It is about a phase of chopping of file, i.e. of transformation of a large file into a shorter and single digital print.
The computers “take” the new transaction and add to him a number before “chopping” the unit.
The goal being to find the number which gives a particular print (many of zeros at the beginning).
Once this found number, the other nodes check easily that it is the good.
The transaction is then indestructiblement related to the chain of the whole of the other transactions; any modification would change the print.
If, to defraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because both have different prints.
The computer having solved the challenge gains 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until the hundred millionth, which leaves margin…
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase of the computing power.
The life of the network already had tops and bottoms.
Providing Web sites of the services for Bitcoin were attacked and the bitcoins in stolen deposits.
“The fault used does not relate to the protocol itself”, Pierre Noizat ensures, who has just launched Paymium, a company of payment in true currency using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB mentions also possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash also has this defect.
Serious actors as Wikipedia refuse the gifts of this nature.
Others, like the platform of blogs WordPress, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that nearly 80% of the bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, “giant balances” were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged”, is delighted Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a teaching book on this currency, believes much in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, are equivalent to a credit card (in true currency) or to a payment by mobile without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which cost thus less.
The carrier manages moreover its identity and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in the merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to communicate an address which a telephone can “photograph and recognize”, Pierre Noizat specifies, who ensures to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of reconsideration of the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will be necessary time so that Bitcoin is essential, but 2013 could be revolving”, he predicts.
Besides The ECB, in his report, envisages to revalue the various risks, now considered as raised, in the event of success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And afterwards?
The French troops left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army takes again possession of its territory and that the Afghans choose their future, without all to expect us.
They are especially the Afghan peasants whom we punished by regarding them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 killed soldiers, and the casualties, mutilated.
The talibans are composed foreign extremists, former chiefs taken refuge in Pakistan, but often of peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, like time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, old and antiquated, even if they were joined by Jihadists, Pakistani, Arabic, Uzbeks, inhabitants of Tajik.
Tolerated, sometimes helped by the local insurrectionists, those will not be it any more when the Westerners are done more discrete.
The departure of the French troops of the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of planted hills of almond trees thanks to French appropriations, was done in the order.
The convoys of trucks and armoured tanks joined Kabul without being attacked, flown over by helicopters.
There will be no beachcomber of the talibans on Kabul as of the end of 2014.
The circumstances changed since their irresistible projection of 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood because of the fights between various factions.
Their takeover of the country had then been perceived like a kind of release, a return to the security.
The Afghan ones paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants exceeded by the organization of Al-Qaeda, but their situation did not improve nowadays.
Former mujaheddin, Afghan government and current talibans meet in the desire to keep the women in a lower position.
The principal notable ones of the anti-Soviet war returned to the power in 2001.
They were moulted as racketeers, being seized of governmental grounds to resell them in building plots with the returned refugees of Iran and Pakistan, profiting D " enormous contracts American from subcontracting.
They were discredited; most between them themselves did not fight besides.
People, as I heard in the campaigns, aspire to a government which is not made up robbers.
Many young people want to leave, as those which will leave knew to benefit from American generosities: the capital flight is considerable.
The young people are tired war and of its ideologies.
They mixed with the modern world at the time of their exiles in Iran or in Pakistan, they appreciated the advantages of them.
Approximately 65% of the population have less than 25 years; Kabul counts 5 million inhabitants now, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the governmental schools are full, girls like boys.
It will be necessary to provide work to these young people who will not want to turn over any more to the obscurantism of the old parties nor to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opponents, are fond of delicacies mobile phones; television, and its serials Turkish which present a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities which will order it be regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet fight are already worried to reconstitute provincial militia, which will escape the central power.
Afghanistan, country of mountains, with the strong local identities, should be able to profit from a certain decentralisation, with the image of the Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized State, with presidential power extremely, removing the post of Prime Minister who existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzaï does not want controls foreign, in particular at the time of the elections envisaged in April 2014.
But its country is, since the Fifties and already quite front, depend on foreign aid.
No industry was re-starting, no stopping is not in state, no system important of irrigation is not repaired.
All is imported; nothing is produced, except fruit and vegetables.
The priority is left on the initiative private.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, a governmental control on the infrastructures would have been necessary.
The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had immense mining wealths.
That did nothing but add to the feeling which Westerners N " were there that to seize some.
Without energy to treat the copper or iron ore on the spot, nor of means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese already almost left the copper mine of My Aynak, letting the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) excavate the immense Buddhist site and remain the most important employers of the province.
It will be necessary a day well also that Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which largely imports and exports depend, restore normal reports.
The departure of the fighting troops French was completed on November 20th.
The new treaty of co-operation envisages the continuation of the traditional assistances: high school of girls, boys, department of French at the university, Institute French, co-operation in the military fields, legal, medical and agricultural, support for the archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, to try “to gain the hearts and the spirits” and to carry out the task impossible to make coincide offensive assistances and actions, a service D "" actions civilo-soldiers” of the ministry for Defense (Cimic), removed in 2012, carried out, and makes conclude by small an ONG Frenchwoman, many work of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in tens of villages of mountain.
This work, greedy in hand-D " works local, could help to contain the insurrection: irrigation, well, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, protection of the grounds and increase in cultivable surfaces.
What will we leave like remembering, after two billion military euros of expenditure?
A budget much more modest would contribute to the improvement of the local living conditions, very hard in these valleys often located at more than 2,000 meters of altitude.
The embassy received tens of written requests for small agricultural achievements emanating from local communities of the province of Kapisa.
So that they are released from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, which the farmers told me to wish, it would be necessary to maintain in their favour a small civil help, controlled well and which touches them directly.
A Constitution with the forceps in Egypt
It is a new gamble of president Mohammed Morsi.
Whereas Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which grants temporarily the absolute powers to him, it decided to play its go-all.
Taking everyone of short, he announced, Wednesday, that the constituent Assembly would vote for her final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted two months additional to this Parliament to finish her work.
Here are soon two years that Egypt is pressed on a provisional text, several times amended what weakens stability institutional and led to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative did nothing but increase the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in its “is delirious autocratic”, continuing “to betray his word” and “to trample the right”.
On the side of his partisans, one ensures that it is a means of finishing some as fast as possible with the institutional and political crisis, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be organized in the fifteen days.
A very short period of time which obliges the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, with the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of finding a popular and democratic legitimacy whereas the dispute made fumes in all the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorably, as it affirmed in an interview with the American weekly magazine Time.
The more so as this recourse to a precipitated vote is due of the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: “Either you vote for my text, or I keep the absolute powers”, those having supposedly to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange environment that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, with great islamist majority, voted for the text yesterday.
Most liberals missed with the call.
Mid-November, little before the constitutional declaration, they had flapped the door, estimating not to have been able to put forward their sights.
The representatives of the human rights, the religious minorities or the civil society had made some in the same way.
So that the quorum necessary is reached, 11 people, of the members substitutes, were added to haste, yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
Without surprise, it is generally unanimously that the articles were voted.
Commentators had fun besides owing to the fact that one of the only divergences of the day was expressed around… the hour of the prayer, certain members of the committee estimating that it clock of constituent was badly regulated.
The text, which was still in the train D " being voted yesterday evening, comprises 234 articles.
Objects of all the attentions, article 2 remains finally identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, stipulating that “the principles of the charia are the primary source of the right.”
The Salafist parties, for which L " establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace “the principles” by “the rules”, which would have allowed a more strict application.
For the islamist ones, the fact that this article was not modified is a pledge of their good will and their respect of the other components of the Egyptian company.
“Hypocrisy”, the liberals answer, who see only one blow of communication there.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They aim in particular article 220, which confers on the Al-Azhar university an advisory role, in particular as regards checking the conformity of the laws with the charia.
According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is worrying because “people called has to decide are not elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy.
One can see the first steps of a theocracy there”.
Fears of the liberals moreover are poked by the fact that the next vice-chancellor of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
“For the time being, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution, one remains within the framework of the Civil status.
Most lawyers who worked on this text are not oulémas but academics, for some trained in the French system” Alexis Blouet moderates, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes “that there can be an ambiguity around article 220, because the terms employed borrow from the religious vocabulary.
One refers to the “fiqh there” in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, note].
And the question could in the future arise to know up to what point of the civil judges are qualified to decide above”.
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is very criticized because as of wide powers which it grants to the president of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers make the point that those are clearly reduced in comparison with what they were under the former regime.
Another litigious point: powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wish of the soldiers, the examination of the defence budget will not be submitted to the Parliament, but at a National council of defense.
Not more than the lawsuits of civilians in military tribunals will not be prohibited, as defense associations of the human rights required it.
These last inform also of their concerns concerning the text, which they judge liberticide.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and it insult from now on is prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, of the press in particular.
Moreover, no article echoes more protection of the women, underlines Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by article 36.
The word did not appear in the preceding one Constitution.
Whereas the Egyptian president was to express himself yesterday evening on television, of the demonstrations are envisaged this afternoon.
The supports of the Head of State will ravel them, Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the Center of the world and a brine sea expect the Ukrainian tourists
Terre Promise joins together the size of the biblical truths, modern comfort and a wild nature.
Argoumenty I Fakty retained five great reasons to return to you to Israel.
Leave to adore the holy places
Appointment impossible to circumvent: banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that whoever penetrates these “baptismal funds” will be touched by the divine Grace.
As for Galileo, it is the ground of the miracles of Jesus: where water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on water, where it alleviated the storm or where the fishing season was miraculous.
It is at this precise place that Jesus appeared in front of his disciples after Resurrection.
But where you will find the most places holy, it is well in Jerusalem.
The believers traverse there the Street of the Suffering or the way of Latin Cross (: via Dolorosa).
This way starts close to the fortress Antonia (the court), where the lawsuit was held, then led by the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha, towards the place of the Crucifixion, then towards that of the Pierre of Oiling and the setting to the tomb.
They is here that the Christian center of the world is, symbol of the hello of humanity.
According to the Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is set up at the place where the tree used grew to make the cross on which was crucified Jesus.
Jerusalem also shelters the place more crowned Jews: the Wailing Wall which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 av. J-C.
According to the tradition, people of different confessions leave there short notes accompanied by prayers which are then granted.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the Massada fortress, old refuge against the enemies built by Hérode the Large one in 25 av. J-C. for its family.
These ruins are on the rocks precipice of a mountain to 450 m above sea level.
Only the amateurs of mountaineering can go there by their own means.
For the others, a cable car takes them along on this top full with history.
North of country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m of altitude, are the ski station of the Hermont Mount which accommodates many tourists the winter.
A shuttle can lead you to it since the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes make 45 km length on the whole.
The old beliefs want that pagan gods lived the top of the mountain formerly.
Visit single museums
This country shelters nearly 300 museums.
Impossible to visit them all during one only stay.
Here are five the most interesting which is worth really the turning.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located close to Knesset (Parliament).
It shelters the very old manuscripts of Qumrân, or Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Desert of Judaea, like nearly 500 miles of archaeological artifacts and anthropological.
To also see: the Museum of art of Tel-Aviv.
One exposes to it mainly the fabrics of the impressionists and expressionist Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
With Acre, the Al-Basha Hammam expects you with its Turkish baths made up of mouldings of the visitors and the supervisors of the time.
Once in Césarée, enter the single private Ralli Museum where you will be able to admire sculptures of Rodin.
There are no guides nor of souvenir shops.
The entry is free and the gifts are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or memorial of Yad Vashem, located at Tel-Aviv, which returns on the historical pages most dramatic of the history.
The most tragic part is the memorial of the children, built in memory of 1.5 million children exterminated in and the gas chamber concentration camps.
You there enter and penetrate in a total darkness.
Stars scintillate.
You then hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of country in which they died.
The Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Health and wellness
The three great seaside resorts of Israel are on banks of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each one of it proposes watery swimming pools, parks, giant delphinariums and aquariums.
To note: you will be able to bathe in the Red Sea even the winter, because the temperature of water does not go down below 21° while that of the air can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even hotter and you can bathe there all the year.
By the way, it is the most single sea in the world: it low occupies the point of the Earth, that is to say 417 m below sea level.
The water of color azure contains brine and retains the bathers very easily, even those which cannot swim.
The landscapes which surround it are of a surrealist beauty.
One comes there to carry out a treatment containing salt water, of silt, curative muds and to look after various diseases such as the dermatitides, the allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitides, the diabetes but also for quite simply slackening.
Discover the secrecies of Antiquity
They are kept by the old city of Tel-Aviv, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean.
It is crossed by the famous one Via Husbands who connects Egypt, Syria, it Anatolia and Mésopotamie.
The city is mentioned in the Greek and Egyptian legends of Antiquity.
According to the legend, it is here that Noah built his arch and that Persée saved beautiful Andromède, with which it lived ici-même long and happy life.
The tourists particularly like to walk in the narrow lanes which are called after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to “your” sign, the destiny will smile you.
In Jaffa you will be able to cross young grooms come to make photo meetings of any Israel and even of other countries.
In Césarée, city of king Hérode, you will be able to trott yourselves in the Roman theatre, “to conquer” the fortress of the crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Césarée was the principal city of Judaea and the residence of the Roman prosecutors, in particular of Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is used today for the concerts of evening and the shows of opera.
Note with the tourists
If you leave for Israel, you do not worry for your English: approximately 30% of the population speak Russian.
For your travel, it is to better prefer the dollars with the euro, because they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As regards the urban transport, they are mainly the buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haïfa has the only underground line of the country, composed of six stations and able to connect the parts low and high of the city.
It is almost about an underground funicular.
The way in all the types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes during 1:30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath saturdays.
Friday evening with the sunset saturdays, the markets, the stores and transport public cease their activity.
And the working week starts every Sunday morning.
Many coffees, restaurants and hotels serve only as food casher, which excludes the pig, the seafood, fishes without scales and the dishes made up at the same time of milk and meat.
One proposes there all a multiplicity of dishes containing lamb and of ox, of soups and desserts containing coconut milk but also the houmous, the traditional Jewish paste, various sauces, ground chickpea the balls, the falafels, of the fruits and vegetables.
There are no dogs wandering in the streets of the Israeli cities.
On the other hand, one finds many well nourished cats which walk the haughty air.
One can see them the evening sleeping on the roofs of the parked cars.
These cat-like likes the busy places and do not refuse that they are levelled.
The hiring of a car varies according to the brand of 37 $ for 24:00 (Hyundai Getz) with 188 $ (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs 15 $ the day.
To rent a bicycle will cost you 15 shekels the day.
An entry with the museum costs on average 30 shekels.
The language of the figures
Three million tourists of the whole world visited Israel in 2012.
They were especially people come to travel and rest of the United States, of Russia, of France, of Germany, of Italy, of England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists went as a Terre Promise from January to October 2012, that is to say 51% of more than in 2010, before the cancellation of the visas on February 9th, 2011.
“Which language has, to Moscow goes”: the migrants save money to learn the language
Whereas the deputies and the militants of the human rights polemize on what the relative law will give to the obligatory linguistic test, of the defrauders selling of “false” certificates already made their appearance in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant worker comes to Moscow, Saint-Pétersbourg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are natives of the Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their stayed at home families.
Since December 1st, a law is coming into effect and stipulates that each migrant worker will have to pass a Russian examination.
For the moment, this rule relates to only those which intend to work in the sector of the services, housing, the services to the individuals and the retail selling.
However, with time, promises the federal migratory Service, the tests will become obligatory for all the immigrants.
Moreover, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the History of Russia and the bases of right.
It will be necessary to validate its Russian knowledge of languages to obtain and renew his work permit.
Only the nationals of the countries are free where Russian has the statute of official language.
The people having obtained certificates or diplomas of teaching before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are not concerned either with this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of the rights
The network of the centers of examination will be under the aegis of the Russian Institute of language Pouchkine, the University of the friendship of the people, the University of State of Moscow, the University of State de Saint-Pétersbourg and other establishments of higher education of Russia.
The immigrants will be able to pass the examinations in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centers were already open on all the territory.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the deputies of the Duma of State and the Federal service of the migrations.
But, before the law between into force, the defenders of the human rights already to many recoveries asked the question in the press: what will that give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for the Russians and the immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the migratory service, that answer will allow to reduce the number of people suffering “from the slave system to work”.
Many speak about defense rights of migrant worker, explains the director of the office of the Russian Federal service of the migrations in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of the rights must start before their departure.
Only a system of organized selection will make it possible to solve 90% the problems of the foreign blue-collar workers.
The problems arise for the migrants without profession, without formation, those which do not know the language and which do not have medical certificates.
Without the comprehension of the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is intended to cross people dishonest persons who, under pretext to help it of, will provide him a “travel” in an over-populated maisonnette where him and tens of its similar will be tormented during months without food and paper and will have to slave away between 12 and 14 hours per day.
We receive many complaints on behalf of our migrants.
“On their premises, a thing is promised to them, and when they arrive, they are misled, their passport is taken, and they do not touch the wages envisaged”, confirms the Chief of the Management of the services of migration for the work of the migratory service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Do not dispute me, Mister the police officer!
However, of many nationals of the Republics of Central Asia which wishes to come to gain money in Russia entrust that they not know not only the language of the country where they wish to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is of course not their fault, but well their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Inhabitants of Tajik can be allowed to follow would be this only one passable primary education.
Indeed, their families do not have even what to nourish their children without speaking of equipping them correctly and to equip them for the school.
As soon as they arrive at adolescence, these young people leave to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It is difficult when the language is not known, they entrust.
“You feel decreased and reduced”.
The defenders of the Human rights notice however an important aspect of the relative law to the language.
The examinations will be intended only to the migrants who have a legal statute.
Without statute, there will be no examination nor of official work thereafter.
However, most migrant worker continue to live in Russia in an illegal way.
“Welcome or defense to enter”
Many immigrants explain why it is not so easy to obtain an official statute in Russia.
Reason? Administrative barriers and always these linguistic difficulties.
Moreover, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 miles roubles.
And then, one can quickly obtain a false recording for only 1,500 roubles.
The Russian police officers know that we have false documents, that we do not have a recording, from where the cases of extortion.
“They ask us 100.200 roubles, of what to buy cigarettes, tea”, entrusted to the journalists Oumed Khouchkadamov, native of Tajikistan.
“Make quickly, stinginess not and buys a beautiful work of art”
As of the first day of the coming into effect of the relative law to the language, one discovered that papers of recording of the migrants were not the only ones with being false.
Several false certificates of examinations of languages were already confiscated by the employees of the federal service of the migrations.
Falsified papers leave an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners had them for nothing: each migrant who thus hoped to facilitate the task of the examinations had to spend seven thousand roubles for this document.
It is twice and half expensive than the official procedure: this one will cost migrant worker three thousand roubles.
The representatives of the power and the defenders of the Human rights agree to say that the short-term objective is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible simply to buy these “bits of paper”.
The authorities can give to migrant worker who could not validate the examination of the first blow time to follow language classes.
Moreover, the immigrants who do not know Russian will see proposed a work in fields which do not imply to communicate actively with people.
The Ministry for the Interior does not deal with the market of the weapons
The share of the crimes implying of the legal weapons is very weak
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to harden the law in the opposition as of carriers to civil weapons.
Such is the reaction of the authorities vis-a-vis recent incidents: that it is the shootings carried out at the time of the marriages or the slaughter organized by the Muscovite lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who caused seven deaths.
The police wants to prohibit the port of the weapons with rubber balls in the public places and to record the lawful age of obtaining the gun licence by making it pass from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the chief of the committee of the Duma for the security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya who promised that the amendments with the law on the weapons would be introduced at the Duma of State soon.
Everyone is not satisfied to see that the Russian authorities try to solve the problem in “tightening the screw”.
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, of the representatives of various centers of shootings, require to give up “this foolish hardening”.
The percentage of crimes committed with a recorded weapon is tiny, declared with the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, lawyer and specialist in the crime for the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry for the Interior, over one six months period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services while 1.168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the reinforcement of the laws concerning the civil weapons will not prevent the criminals from being supplied at the black-market.
According to them, one can find today in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry for the Interior affirms that it controls the diffusion of the illegal weapons.
Suppliers: factory with the officer
The black-market of the weapons is provided via several channels.
The principal channels are five, tells Victor Baranets, colonel with the retirement having been used ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General headquarter.
Capture screen drawn from a site taking of the orders of weapons
The first is “the military trace”, i.e. the weapons which were flights during military operations in the Caucasus.
“These weapons were flights by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians”, explains Baranets.
The second type of weapons resulting from the black-market are those concealed by the criminals with the police.
Baranets explains why it is as well the weapons flights in stocks of the police as those catch directly with the representatives of the police.
The illegal guns leave on sale since the military warehouses.
Many of the latter often underwent explosions.
“Attested versions indicate that certain fires were started intentionally to dissimulate the deficit”, explains the former serviceman.
For Baranets, the gunmakers are there for something.
“One sees factories of private weapons which do not compete with competition on the international market and run out the weapons on the black-market, in particular in Moscow”, tells an expert.
One of the other sources of the black-market is smuggling.
A significant portion of guns and machine-guns come from the poor countries, like Kirghizie.
“One finds there a local production, sometimes artisanal, a Mafia created and organizes the supply”, the former serviceman adds.
From which do the weapons come?
The experts evaluated the approximate share of each source of the illegal weapons on the black-market.
A report on the question was made up in 2011 by the Center of analysis of the problems and study for the public administration.
Specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry for the Interior and Rosstat, the files criminal and the public data of the portals relating to the weapons.
The great majority of the illegal weapons, explain the researchers, comes from the army and the police.
Half of the weapons present on the black-market managed “by fault of the employees whose work is related to the weapons”, one explains in the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from the military places of conflicts, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% result from “clandestine excavations”.
A salesman and consultant of an arms manufacture having requested to keep anonymity ensure that since long time nobody buys the weapons found by these specialists in the clandestine excavation; they are too old.
Generally, according to him, the salesmen will seek the new goods in the military warehouses.
The person buys via an ensign a unit, for example a gun All.
One delivers it to him while passing the goods by a netting.
“It transports it downtown and resells it for 900 € by the unit with two chargers”, he tells.
“It is true that the police is with the current of all the business, thus, when crimes are about to be elucidated, it carries out a purchase of control near the merchants of illegal weapons”, the salesman adds.
“As in a shop of luxury”
The salesman and the purchaser are generally by the means of knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a type appears and proposes to me to come to the station from Begovaya where somebody became to take me along in a “corner” to haggle over.
The price of the gun, one gave it on the spot to me
Victor Baranets in military observer
To find a gun, it is necessary that I know somebody who has a contact, explains the salesman. I know somebody, but I do not trust him.
There are salesmen on the markets, but over there it is necessary to also come while saying for example “On behalf of such person, who asked me to transmit that his/her daughter lost a tooth”.
Now I buy even a pair of American fists using a person whom I trust.
It delivers them to me only with me because it knows that I will not give it.
The small new ones seek weapons in various ways.
The former serviceman Victor Baranets tested himself as a purchaser of illegal weapons in the middle of the years 1990 when it prepared to publish an article on the subject.
The diagrams, according to him, did not change.
Him a photo album was given in which there was “all that one wants”.
“I believed myself in a shop of luxury”, remembers the soldier.
It there does not have a secrecy for the purchaser, explains Baranets, one can all test.
As potential customers, I am not satisfied to buy, one goes with the salesman in forest and one installs a target.
“One lets me draw and when I am convinced that the weapon works well, one starts to negotiate”, the expert describes.
A shop since its settee
The search engines display the sites and the groups on Vkontakte where one can buy weapons “for various uses”.
For that, one needs any document and nobody to meet.
“It is enough to have an amount of money specifies”, one writes in publicity on the site “To buy a gun or a machine-gun of combat”.
The users there leave their request and put their questions.
And does one sell to the minors?
“Without licence, of course”, asks the user “Ivan” (preserved orthography).
“All Buys. Moscow”, written “Fedorenkov” in its very direct request.
The Federal security service diffused an immense network of false sites and collects with the shovel the people eager to buy combat weapons.
People ruent themselves on food like famished wolves and then they are found to exploit coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and former serviceman
I heard of this kind of diagrams: generally, the site is recorded out of field of application of the Russian laws.
People take the orders.
The purchaser carries out the payment on the automatic terminals.
“It receives in return a photograph and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden”, explains Right secretary of association the “to a weapon”, Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets affirms that by making a request on the site, one can find oneself without weapon and behind the bars.
The Federal security service diffused an immense network of false sites and collects with the shovel the people eager to buy combat weapons.
“People ruent themselves on food like famished wolves and then they are found to exploit coal in Siberia”, - affirms it.
Makarov for 100 dollars
The purchase of an illegal firearm, estimate the experts, can cost between 100 and 900 dollars.
According to Right Dmitry Kislov of association “to a weapon”, one can buy a Makarov gun for 100-300 dollars.
It will be necessary to expect approximately a month and half.
It left the warehouses long life by the direction of these warehouses of mean size.
According to the official data of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes has as a whole decreased in Russia of 7% and rises with 22.9 miles while the proven cases of flight and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs dropped by 7.8%.
United States: the employees of fast-food and the supermarkets are in strike
Nearly a quarter of the American teenagers pass by a work of cash clerk at McDonald's
These last days, a wave of protest is assembled against the low wages practised by the Walmart supermarkets and the famous chains of fast-food industry such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy' S and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, nobody can predict if this wave will gain in importance or to blow itself quickly.
These actions are supported by the trade unions and a certain number of associations of left.
Parallel to the modest wage increase that the basic employees at Walmart and in the chains of fast-food industry perceive, the organizers of the demonstrations wish to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not for the moment not covered by the trade union movement.
46 hundreds a year?
The demonstrations began last week, after Thanksgiving, “black Friday”, at the moment when a breaking rain of balances seizing million inhabitants fell down on America and starting scandals sometimes.
This day, some paid of the Walmart company, which employs in the world 2.2 million people, left their station to organize strike pickets with the trade unions and the activists of left in the stores of the company whose products are intended to the consumers of the modest and average classes.
Walmart markets all: layers with the shotguns via the batteries of car, the vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are there on average 8% to 27% less expensive than in the large supermarkets.
This is why much of paid evil paid at Walmart make their races only on their workplace.
The price and the choice of the products did of Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to criticisms, Walmart can allow itself to sell its cheap products in particular because of the low wages of its employees.
The latter also complain about the difficult work conditions, for example lack of forklift trucks or scanners portable.
The participants of the manifestations of “black Friday” asked for a pay rise, they complained owing to the fact that the price of the medical insurance provided by the company had increased by 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart which touches 9.5 $ of the hour, it is a sum which it cannot allow.
Scientists of the Californian university of Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average wages with 12 $ of the hour, that would cost the group 3.2 billion dollars.
It is 1.1% of more than the EC what he currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all the wage increase on the shoulders from the consumers, each race in the store would total to them 46 hundreds more.
They will spend in one year only 12.39 dollars moreover than now.
The partisans of Walmart notice with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine States and did not carry any damage to the group.
“Black Friday” continued in the stores of 8:00 the evening to midnight the following day and Walmart sold over this period 5000 articles at the second.
Its cases carried out in all 100 million transactions for “black Friday”.
The spokesperson of the company Dan Fogleman ensured in an interview the site of left Huffington Post that in very “less than five” employees of Walmart their stations had left and that the protest was only one “communications operation among so much of others” on behalf of the organizing trade union.
“Following Customer!”
The protests continued this week in New York and related to either the Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, this is why they are not established yet there) but McDonald's and other restaurants cheap.
McDonald's announces to sell billion portions and after they do not even give you a vacation disease and do not pay you the work which you made honestly!
Jumaane Williams, member of the Town council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage envisaged by the federal legislation and that of New York east of 7.25 $ of the hour.
Fast-food increase them with time, but little, on average its basic employees touches in New York 8.90 $ of the hour.
Nobody touches less than them in this city.
For me it is inconceivable to live with this sum in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of the American teenagers worked at McDonald's after the high school while living in their parents.
Few people saw their primary source of incomes there or wished to remain there for a long time.
Today, I find myself with interviewing employees of McDonald's which complain about having to live with these wages and sometimes having to nourish their children with.
In addition, on the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal one finds comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you do not know with what you will nourish them.
The demonstrators who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 close to McDonald's of the 40e street and on Madison Avenue required that the cash clerks and the cooks of fast-food be at least paid 15 $ of the hour, that is to say a multiplication of more than twice than the current minimum wage.
They also asked so that trade unions in the sector of fast-food industry be created.
The American law prohibited with the administration there to prevent and to punish the protesters of a trade union by victimizations or dismissals.
However, the administration seldom simplifies the life to them.
For a trade union, to seize fast-food industry remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of principal is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They are not agreement
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held close to several to other chains to fast-food industry.
The moment headlight of the protest was the gathering in middle of day close to the McDonald's of Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic policies, in particular that of Jumaane Williams, member of the Town council, which declared: “McDonald's announces to sell billion portions and after they do not even give you a vacation disease and do not pay you the work which you made honestly!”.
The demonstrators were supported by other New Yorkean democrats in sight, in particular by the candidate at the post of mayor Bill De Blasio who declared that “we all must support the employees of fast-food industry so that they obtain wages right and the economic welfare which each New Yorkean deserves.
New York Times characterized this demonstration like most important that knew the sector of fast-food industry in all its history.
But only a few hundreds of people took part in it not counting all were not employees of fast-food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is for the moment difficult to say if this spark of movement of mass will make the small ones.
“For the moment, one manages only fairly to mislead the brain”
Lately, the fans of new technologies were accustomed to perceive the reality increased through special glasses.
At the beginning, it is Google which revealed this summer its current model at the time of its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had made the request of the patent.
However, it arises from the discussion with the director of the group of interactive technologies of 3D of the Microsoft laboratory of Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already of the ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect to handle virtual objects in the air with naked hands, by the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Could you in a few words tell us what your group of research does?
- We work on the interaction between the man and the machine and we test in same time to widen the borders of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole remained about it for the moment with the pixels on flat panel display and sometimes with the tactile one.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years in front of us and to guess the radical changes which will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors constitute a step ahead, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the order by the gesture.
- What also books the future to us?
- Although Kinect made the interaction physical, much of things are held on flat panel display, sometimes in 3D.
The seizure of information was improved (the system receives more data), but the output, for the moment, not really.
We try to change that and we work on systems of imagery truly 3D functioning on various technologies, in particular technologies of projection.
It is necessary to make leave the computing world in ours, in the physical world, to make it more tactile.
For that, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space which surrounds it.
Thus, we will be able to supplement the real world by virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to start, we remove from these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think of the vocal order?
It is it appreciated, but isn't over-estimated?
One cannot say that it is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one always does not want to inform the others of his actions or his intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each one in its niche.
For example, to order the devices in the public places, we had a plan for which we thought of gestures, not of the broad gestures, but rather with discrete gestures, restricted.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet carried to the hand which recorded the movements of the bones and the muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it in keeping with a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed order, for example: gesture + voice.
- I.e.?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this quill to you?
You would do it with the word and the gestures.
- Usually, I only speak.
- Oh, that will be difficult to recognize.
- Therefore, do you want to force the users to adapt according to what the machine can or not to make at a given time?
- Not obligatorily, but it is about a mutual bringing together.
I think that very soon we will have to work with the development of new types of sensors which will enable us to better identify the reactions of the man.
They can be for example the sensors laser, they produce a rather in-depth good resolution and it is very important.
- If one is interested in your work on the sensors Xbox Kinect, what you don't like in the modern cameras?
Do they miss resolution, of depth or of another thing?
- In theory, it is on the present generation that we base ourselves in our work on the recognition 3D.
It would be obviously well to obtain approximately 8 mégapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the mégapixels themselves, but well the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are rather good, that adds work with the originators of algorithms.
It is necessary to keep in mind the resolution according to axes X and Y, but also Z.
Speed imports also much, the number of frameworks at the second.
The human movements are rather dynamic, and the 30 c/s are not really enough, especially for the gestures.
Steven Bathiche, of our laboratory of Redmond gave to the touch of the sensors a regular delay of treatment ranging between 1 and 100 µs, the current sensors being more close to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand at which point that influences the interaction of the man and the machine.
I would need well a device of this type in my work, but not requiring touch, to have more executives at the second.
- But shouldn't one increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect has today three “cameras”, of which one is in fact an infra-red lamp and the second, a receiver of the considered signal.
And the third camera is in fact a usual sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem…
Or to worsen it by increasing the necessary volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, to play with the curve of the cameras and to see how that could help to define the sites.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that from a point of view of the daily use of technologies of increased reality, the glasses are one of the platforms presenting the most prospects?
- Of course, to walk all the time with a smartphone the raised hands is not practical but here what I think: the best option would be an increased reality “transitory” which would enable you starting from a platform cloud to pass from the glasses to the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and it is that which makes their force (the personal elements are those which you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the reality increased starting from the glasses will not enable you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let us imagine one moment that the handling of the virtual holographic objects in the air is more accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the ordinary human being.
There is a problem on which the opponents with this idea point the finger: there is no tactile feeling!
The hands do not feel anything!
Which answers your group does it prepare compared to this challenge?
- In my courses, I often say that increased reality is the seventh opening in the interaction between the man and the machine.
I think that the eighth could wellness the very addition of the tactile feelings.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to be used as support of image.
It records the pressures perfectly!
But there are also technologies which are really intended to allot palpability to these “images in the air”: for example the interference of several rays ultrasounds directed towards a precise point where the finger is and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of an air blast on the ends of the fingers.
There are also the bracelets related to the wrists which influence the nervous terminations of the fingers, they are also a work axis presenting of the prospects.
- And did you try to mislead the brain?
Should he to make believe that it feels what it normally feel at the time when he sees something?
- Here is a good idea, we did not test yet.
There is still a task down there on which it will be necessary still a long time to give oneself evil: the manner of making accept somebody who is physically in a very reduced space that it goes in an almost infinite opened space - we work on the concepts of the carpets of race (nothing to see with those which one finds in the clubs of fitness), of the mobile platforms and also of the giant balls.
For the moment, one manages only fairly to mislead the brain, it remains still many years of work.
Here what returns work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in an absolute state of fecundation.
The reign of the taste and not of the culture - Rosbalt.ru
“Rosbalt” continues the project “the avant-garde pétersbourgeoise” dedicated to the townsmen who are in advance, with the avant-garde of the culture and Article.
This ultra-selective list already accommodated eminent actors of the artistic scene of Saint-Pétersbourg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and who found a recognition in Europe, after having been known in all Russia.
The new hero of “Rosbalt” is the painter extrovert Kirill Miller.
All the city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, very of dressed red which one can cross close to the Russian Museum, the Garden of summer or in the festivals and varnishings connected.
The tables of Kirill Miller always gather crowd, whatever their place of exposure.
It is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical storytellers pétersbourgeois, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is eminent representing avant-garde pétersbourgeoise the end of 1980 and beginning of the years 1990.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes smile the inhabitants and good mood puts.
It recently took in its hands a barrel organ and it became the symbol of this Saint-Pétersbourg instrument since it had matured enough for this difficult role from his existence, its philosophy and its image of gipsy.
- Kirill, why you course the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose the red as dressmaker specialized in the aspect and the image.
In this world, the red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and the company.
Even if in the company, all that is not gray causes aggressiveness and a negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
All the history of my provocative actions is an invitation with the discussion.
- And when did you understand that you were to be a painter?
- With the exposure of the Palate of the Nevskiy culture where my work was.
I understood that it was my way.
Then, the wave of the old nonofficial painters had passed and new the, free ones, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I started to bind me friendship with the painters of the new wave, with those of Postgazonevchtchina which gave rise to “Pouchinskaya-10” and then there was not any more of vagueness.
I am interested in the theatre, the mode, the music, all the kinds safe with the words.
- And all that was found in your artistic Private clinic… - It was important for me to find me in the center of the culture of Saint-Pétersbourg where must meet the best creative forces.
In 1995, I took taken seat with Pouchkinskaya-10 which sheltered before work a musical and artistic club, a club gipsy, the house of Bohemian the pétersbourgeoise.
Many was born there: The NAME, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arriving with the project “the ear of Van Gogh”.
Chnour and its friends sang easy songs in playback in grinding shirts, they counted among them Igor Vdovin, composer today with the mode.
When the group started to occur into live, it became “Leningrad”.
Trakhtenberg animated not bad emissions before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and at this point in time its great career started, but its formation and its basic education, it is on our premises that it received them.
Gallery “D137”, Club “Griboïedov”: they are repercussions of the artistic Private clinic.
Our employees left there as accustomed.
I am a hero of the century spent, time when the culture wanted to say something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the price “the personalities of our city”.
I was appointed “Painter of the year”, and at this point in time my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new time with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Much of my tables are hits, they have news and a very strong acuity.
I will have an exposure programmed “the Russian museum through the clowns”.
The clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was somebody of social, today that hurt and that frightened to be thus.
But with the clowns, very deletes itself, the tragedy fall.
I like the grotesque one, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea to save the world via the total and obligatory disguise.
Today, it is the dress which imports, one is interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Perhaps that one cannot give him the hand, but which it is rather necessary to spit to him with the mug.
And the lie will be deleted by the disguise.
- Recently you saw we in the role of the organ grinder of Cruelty. - A cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Who of other that me can play it.
- But perhaps that commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today commercial art must be neat, delicate, liqueur-like.
A disintegration of the culture is occurring.
Front, people were shared in herds, the partisans of Bohemian liked a thing, denied them another.
Today, all is divided into microphone-communities, it is difficult to like everyone.
I am not a ticket of one hundred dollars to like everyone.
Today, it is necessary to think of which you will like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhaïlov!
- They are people whom one threw which comes to see it, it is the sexual and social side which goes.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and at the end of the day it is less management, of money, all decays.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to mislead them, not to waste lived.
When I was young, I painted paintings which a collector hung beside Falk or of Larionov.
I started with the tables which usually are those that one paints at the end of the lifetime.
Today, the ideas are often confused.
One says: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption does not have culture, that does not have anything to see.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and which precisely refused the money for painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, which lack with Saint-Pétersbourg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the civil servant of the culture.
But all cannot work in the culture.
Under the reign of the good tsars, they were not like that, the tsars did not understand the culture well, but they understood that the good experts had to be kept.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here with Saint-Pétersbourg who could be experts, but they are isolated, because one needs higher experts who will evaluate these experts correctly and will cut through a path to them.
Currently, it is the “reign of the taste” which flowers.
Same Erarta, but they are differed in the sense that they say honestly that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are painters who must be other museums.
- For you, what is it Saint-Pétersbourg?
- Saint-Pétersbourg is not the cultural capital, there is in Moscow much more culture, there is a ground for that.
And on our stones, art has difficulty pushing.
We need a cultural ground and we have more writers than readers, it is bad.
In Europe, there are much curious which will see exhibitions, concerts.
On our premises, this layer is very fine.
We must return art to the mode as it was the case at the beginning of last century.
Project carried out with the support of the purse of Saint-Pétersbourg
To be confined in space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a fatal asteroid.
Caravans of space shuttles with the land ones on board leave in search of a planet help.
To save humanity, a great question arises: how to continue to make live our species in weightlessness or on a planet of help?
I believe that there is not much the choice.
There are in fact two true planets which one can conquer, this would be only by assumption.
“It is of Venus and Mars”, Vladimir Sourdine, researcher of astronomical Institut of State P.K estimates. Chternberg (GAICh).
So over Mars the conditions are adapted for the life, the temperature on the Venus surface is of 500.
One can live there only with very high altitude or on the Venus orbit… in space.
One started to be interested in the questions of the reproduction in space while focusing oneself about the flora.
Still a half-century ago, one carried out experiments on the plants.
Four generations of garden peas cultivated on orbit were not different in any manner of the land varieties.
Then, one put on orbit of the insects, the small flies reproductive drosophilas.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent in the space to see how an embryo in weightlessness developed.
One obtains at the exit a completely normal chick.
It is then that the problems start.
“The problem is related to the fact that the chick must find a support, it must be put on its legs and start to move”, explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of the medico--biological problems of the Academy of Science of Russia (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
By not finding any support, the chicks were agitated in a disordered way.
And at the end of 10 a.m., the new born ones entirely saw their instincts being atrophied.
The chicks reacted neither to the light nor with the sound.
Unfortunately, they would die quite simply at the end of quattre days.
“Opened wide We to them the eyes twice, then we gave up, because it is quite simply impossible to work with them over there”, explains Vladimir Sychev by noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last “miniature arch” biological with animals was sent on orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite “Bion” will embark only species of the same sex.
There was experience with rats sent with their foetus in space.
In theory, nothing supernatural was discovered.
“They was still the biosatellites and then it is the only experiment. _it be necessary carry out this kind of research”, point out remarquer Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the rats of space gave birth to their offspring.
Nevertheless, one does not manage yet to carry out reproductions directly in space.
It is not a small matter.
By losing their usual medium, the animals are not any more able to carry out their sexual instinct.
Contrary to the animals, the man in is able, in theory.
The Homo sapiens has the abstracted thought, it is able to create a suitable emotional bottom.
This kind of experiment is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But the women have gone in space for already 50 years.
The largest chance was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organization is what humanity has of more invaluable.
Our gull flew away and nobody on Earth could say if it would hold after a flight in space.
If it could have given birth to a child after the vol.
“Nobody answered this question”, explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, reprocessed sector of the rockets and space.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight in space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaïev was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been twice on orbit and to have even worked in extra-vehicular medium, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk continues.
We have little, even very few cosmonauts who did not have anything and who give rise to a descent in full health after long flights.
“And if they are longer, that presents a danger even during the flights in orbit”, concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
However, humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnologies, protection against radiations and the creation of an artificial gravitation.
Laboratory of hydrology of the Preparation centre of the cosmonauts: obligatory stage of the preparation with the vol.
Here, of worthless buoyancy, the cosmonauts involve themselves at the extra-vehicular exits.
Water imitates weightlessness.
So for the adults, water is comfortable but however a foreign medium, for the infants, it is their true element.
The small amphibious men seem to confirm it: the life on Earth comes from the ocean.
Insofar as the baby evolves approximately 9 months in the lymphatic liquid of the belly of his mother, it is easier to him to be accustomed then to water.
It is in theory logical, because since its birth until its first bath, it occurs only 2 weeks.
“Is very little to forget”, explains the instructor of swimming for infants, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, so for the child who has just been born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, basin are atrophied very quickly, the capacity of pushed of the baby is lost.
Good of agreement, let us be unaware of that by pressing us on the simulators of childbirth.
One can of course prepare a childbirth in a special room, the woman will be able to make it leave.
“And then?” ask Valeriy Poliakov to invite to reflect on this complex question.
On another side, the child also needs an artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the earth's gravitational force, the organization does not form the skeleton nor the muscular system.
One cannot equip an infant like an adult with a special combination for the trainings.
It will be quite simply private of its vital needs.
“And this experiment which we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to earth of a handicapped child, entirely made unsuitable”, envisages the Director of the committee for the bioethics of the Institute of the medico--biological problems of the Academy of Science of Russia, Igor Pestov.
The birth of the children in space still concerns the theory.
However, with time that will become reality, when the Land ones go in their shuttles towards a remote planet which will become the habitat of their descent born in space.
The chief of the ISC (higher Institution of control of public finances) declared: “the control of the pseudonym free-lance work (into Czech” Švarc system “) failed because of politicians.
In the field as of public contracts, the Czech Republic lays out qualified inspectors and of a legislation of quality but it is with the drag as regards its application.
It is what Miloslav Kala declared, the vice-president of the higher Institution of control of public finances in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
“The law will be never perfect, but its application must be right and, in my opinion, it is what is lacking on our premises”, Kala in its comment of the current situation declared.
A control carried out jointly by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
It quotes like example of abusive practuice the approach of the “Švarc system” by Petr Ne čas.
Mister the Prime Minister recently declared that the ODS was not going to importune the entrepreneurs with controls; is this thus allowed or prohibited?
“The law owes wellness in one way or another applied, then if it prohibits something, even the chief of the government cannot prevent from acting an authority in charge to go to inspect to require the respect of the law”, Kala notes.
During the meeting of the Audit Board to the Chamber of Deputies, you evoked a project tchéco-German within the framework of which the legislations as regards public contracts of these two countries were compared.
Of what was it question concretely?
It is about a parallel control which we launched there is that approximately two years.
In simple terms, the EU law how envisages to manage the public contracts and of the particular national legislations as well as a practice itself make him continuation.
We gathered all that and although this control procedure is not completed yet, of the very interesting differences appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps “more severe and of better quality”, nevertheless, according to certain parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This thus confirms that it is not enough continuously to work out increasingly detailed rules but which it is necessary to sanction to the application even right.
In what this project can it help you concretely and which it results for you?
A common control of this type should precisely contribute so that we stop endeavouring to specify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when that does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means to obtain the thing in question with a reasonable price (what does not want always to say low), in order to exclude any enrichment and a possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the thresholds of the markets, one will not achieve this goal inevitably.
It could be that this system is at such point submerged by the paperwork, that those which seek the faults of them will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You speak about internal problems concerning the practical application of the legislation of the public contracts.
How does the monitoring system in Germany function?
Does there exist an institution similar to our ISC or a different fashion of organization?
As regards the institutions, in the same way with the ISC, Bundesrechnungshof functions over there which is organized similarly, it also has a council made up a little differently, but these two institutions proceed basically in a similar way.
Competences are also, to a certain extent, similar, with a nuance however compared to our system: Germany being a federal structure, it thus has also course of the accounts of this type with the level of different Länder.
The BRH can only control the federal money, which corresponds on our premises to the financial resources of the state.
The public funds managed on our premises by the areas and the municipalities, are controlled over there on the level as of course of the accounts of Länder.
With regard to is the national legislation, simpler than ours?
I would not like to make general comparison without concrete data, nevertheless, in certain fields, Germany is often indicated as a model but one cannot surely say that it does better in all the fields.
Is it perhaps due to the fact that they have better inspectors?
Not, surely not, but I repeat, I do not have data of comparison.
However, it should be also said that this country that we regard as a model is also confronted with a whole series of problems.
If not wouldn't they have any advantage to cooperate with our institution, not?
With regard to are the national legislation, which meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on the public contracts, its effects already felt?
This amendment having come into effect relatively recently, it does not have impact yet on our check operations.
As we make back testings, it is necessary to take into account a certain delay.
Our observations relate to only, for the moment, the procedure processing of future controls - we launched a new instrument of “detection of the risks of bad management” with which we screened nearly 14,000 public contracts - there these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds were modified as well as the conditions of certain types of procedures of invitations to tender and so on.
Do you thus rather consider the adoption of this law as an advantage or like an addition of load for the administration?
I think that this law constitutes a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem which can occur is that these rules become more severe and that it is not possible to respect them.
Already under the mode of the previous regulation, the person receiving benefits (for example the regional council, in the case of operational programmes regional) forced the subjects controlled to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means failure with the budgetary discipline.
Is it thus really useful to make the law more severe in this way?
Not, not in this way, I think.
The system must exclude those which want to tackle the system or deceive them but not punish those which make formal mistakes without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put of advantage of pressure on the administration.
Which is thus the solution to leave itself there?
Let us look towards where we do not go.
Recently, did the Prime Minister declare that the ODS was not going to importune the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law in one way or another owes to wellness applied, then if it prohibits something, even the chief of the government cannot prevent from acting an authority in charge to go to inspect and to require the respect of the law.
It can declare: “We will change the law and will authorize it”, but it cannot say that we will act as so of nothing was not.
The law on the markets comprises relatively strict rules on the formalities to be achieved and this, precisely in order to protect the invitation to tender.
But it is in addition tragic that a tenderer is eliminated only due to formal defects.
The law will be never perfect, but its application must be right and it is, in my opinion, which is lacking on our premises.
The roads by places are frozen, but the majority remain practicable.
At certain places of the Czech Republic, the roads are cold and also snow-covered.
The network remains however in major practicable part, at certain places with an increased vigilance.
Area of Karlovy Vary
In the area of Karlovy Vary, the roads were this morning practicable, but by places cold and also snow-covered.
The temperatures fell and oscillate between -5 ° and -10 ° C but they should slightly go up in the course of the day.
The snowfalls ceased in the area and it remains in the plains only one fine layer of snow.
The peaks of the metalliferous Mounts (Krušné hory) are however covered with approximately 30 centimeters of snow.
It arises from the data of the regional service of maintenance of the roads that because of the fog, the visibility was by places reduced.
The R6 fast track and the trunk roads of the region are from now on practicable without difficulties.
Vigilance remains however with setting, for example on certain bridges whose coating can be cold and slipping.
All the secondary roads and the ways of third category, including the mountain roads, are also practicable.
There remain still on certain their sections of the remains of cold snow and by places packed by the traffic.
Especially in the zones located in altitude, the drivers must reinforce their vigilance.
Areas of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Management of the roads and motorways announces on its Web site that certain roads of Bohemian of the East are threatened by the formation of glaze and that layers of snow packed by the traffic can be on the roads in the mountainous areas and located in altitude.
The services of maintenance of the roads warn the drivers against the risks of formation of glaze in the zones of the area of Pardubice located in altitude.
There can be glaze in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, and this, mainly on the secondary roads and of third category.
The roads I/43 and I/34 in the neighbourhoods of Svitavy were treated chemically.
Snow is mainly in the Mounts of the Giants (Krkonoše) and the Mounts of the Eagle (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of snow packed by the traffic is present on the roads in the zones located in altitude.
Into Bohemian from the East, time dry, will be generally disengaged today, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a weak wind and the temperatures will generally oscillate between -3 ° and + 1° C.
Pilsen area
The roads of the Pilsen area are practicable today, although, by places, it is advisable to show an increased vigilance and to adapt its control to the weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, the temperatures oscillate between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the last snowfalls and the cooling which followed, certain transportation routes can be by places cold.
The drivers can expect to cross zones of fog, the visibility will improve however gradually.
It is what it arises from information of the regional service of maintenance of the roads.
The D5 motorway is practicable almost without difficulties, the services of maintenance of the road communications recommends however an increased vigilance between kilometers 80 and 131.
The coating of the majority of the trunk roads is dry and cold.
Certain sections can be cold in the district of Pilsen-South and the district of Tachov.
The departmental ways and of third category are wet and in this case applies the warning statement against the cold sections.
The drivers must be vigilant, and that particularly on the less attended roads of the area of Šumava.
Area of Olomouc
The drivers going in the zones of the area of Olomouc located in altitude must take into account a thick and soft layer of snow today on the roads.
This layer remained on the collar says “Červenohorské sedlo” and on the road in the direction of Videlský kříž, after the operations of chemical treatment.
The snowfalls have constrained this night the staff of maintenance of the roads to go on the ground; according to the services in charge of the roadway system, it fell more than three centimetres in the district of Šumperk.
In the other parts of the area, most roadways are practicable without difficulties.
“On the heights of the district of Šumperk remains of snow are.
The drivers circulating in the direction of Jeseník must expect to meet with the collar says “Červenohorské sedlo” a layer of snow thick and soft” with ČTK the chief of the services of maintenance of the roads of the district of Šumperk declared today.
Their colleagues of the district of Jeseník also went to the site during the night; according to the latter, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads, are now released and wet, even in the highest zones.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are practicable without difficulties, in the district of Šternberk the drivers should however pay attention in the sections in forest zones to the roadways remained wet.
Areas of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
As of this morning, the services of maintenance of the roads of Bohemian of North announced several difficult sections.
It arises from the data of the police, that besides certain places covered with snow or glaze, the mountain road going from Telnice to Knínice Na Ústecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain below zero in lower altitude, and thus snow and the glaze should be maintained on the roads. In the plains, in particular in the south east of the central Plate of Bohemian, there is not, on the contrary, no problem and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic jam was announced for the moment.
The services of maintenance of the roads announced the presence of glaze, in particular in the neighbourhoods of Štětí.
According to the meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal with its formation: rain and cast iron of snow during the day, a clear sky and freezing during the night.
One also announces, since the main axes of circulation, of the difficult conditions on the trunk road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closing of circulation between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees which were curved under the weight of snow until reaching the roadway.
Šimon Ornest declared: “In concert, we want to collect positive energy. ”
What do you think owing to the fact that in less than one month it should be the end of the world?
It is only one of this alarming news, the kind of traps into which we like to fall.
In our group The Tap Tap, one laughs about it rather and one thinks that we are the only group able to collect a rest of positive energy in order to push back or to prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, you assemble in December a completely single project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present more in detail this project to our readers?
It is a charitable action which we have prepared for already two years.
We decided to use the potential marketing of the end of the Maya calendar announced for December 21st at 11 hours 10 of the morning.
The day before, on December 20th, three concerts will simultaneously proceed, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will practically finish at the time when will end the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati which is in the Pacific Ocean, on a time zone in 12 hours advance compared to us.
Who had this idea?
At the beginning I think that it was my idea, then we very conceived with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect sufficient positive energy to save the world, we want also together, with the public, to think of the state of the world which we leave to our children.
At the time of the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of single objects, in particular of the shoes, Tee-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The group The Tap Tap with other interpreters also recorded an anthem against the end of the world which is entitled “Fine world cancelled” (in Czech “Konec světa zrušeno”).
It already very popular on YouTube, is one will also hear it at the time of these caritative concerts?
Of course, all at the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world does not take place…
She will be sung simultaneously by all the interpreters in the three concerts.
The anthems will also meet at a time given within the framework of a live emission, completely single, Czech television.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák which also holds the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings there…
How did you come from there to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show biz, because owing to the fact that we organize many concerts and caritative events…
We endeavour to make them take part intensively in these projects.
It proved that most between them are interested by such a co-operation and that amuses them.
With what will serve the benefit as these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training centre which is accessible to the people with reduced mobility and we have worked with the realization within the framework of the Jedlička institute, with association Tap, and that for six years.
Teachers go regularly to the pupils of the institute Jedličkův and activities propose to them which interest them and amuse them.
The students themselves do not have the means of going to courses, we try to help them in this manner.
Within the framework of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička institute, we will transfer this project in a new independent building.
Will several groups of music and interpreters go up on scene at the time of each one of these concerts?
According to which criteria, did you choose?
We tried to work out a program which is addressed to all the generations, including the children.
For example, in Prague, will go up on Chinaski scene, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Do you also prepare with others “méga events” of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time within the framework of the spring of Prague; there too, we will prepare surely a programme of quality with interesting guests.
We would also like to play the next year in the house from the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once on the spot in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalists, up to now you played for example Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a made up group handicapped people.
How do you manage the organization and the logistics of your rounds?
It is not so terrible which that looks with the first access.
We naturally have five members in electric armchair whose machines must travel out of compartment, we take also many luggage and boxes of instruments….
Up to now very happened more or less always well, ČSA and British Airways were prepared always perfectly for us, they astonished me more once.
Even to Moscow, from where we returned recently, very happened without problems.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare in what these countries differ as regards the accessibilities for the people to reduced mobility, the attitude of the public opinion with respect to the handicapped people and so on.
Which were your experiments until now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where all functions better than on our premises, we were precisely pilot in Moscow that in the east all is yet only in one initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still far from accessible to the handicapped people; over there, it is not yet current that a person only moves in electric armchair in the center of the city.
They do not regard yet as an obviousness to give priority to a person in armchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, over there also, an association endeavouring to draw attention to the problems of the handicapped people is being created.
In what do have we to still catch up with more developed countries?
There are many things for which we are still late…
It is important to mention that the improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts made by the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is completely current that people with a heavy handicap only move in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, with the museum, anywhere…
It is nevertheless not very frequent over there that a large number of handicapped people take an active part in the social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather on the contrary to the forefront of progress!
The respect of the public and the accessibilities are a thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have among us sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers famous.
For the moment, they are only isolated cases people who have a strong will.
Is the group The Tap Tap currently very popular, turn over behind a few years, which this group pushed you to create in 1998?
I started to work as a teacher at the Jedlička institute, where I was surrounded by many young loans to invest itself in something.
And as I am myself musician (I play, inter alia, of the saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, with time, like known as our regulator Láďa Angelovič, one lost a little the control of the situation (laughter).
Did success arrive only during these last years, if I am not mistaken?
It is true, the fact of creating bonds with known singers and to work actively with the promotion of the group helped us.
We understood that, if a work is not visible, it is as if there did not exist in the content.
Thanks to the subsidies of the European Union, we can, moreover, to allow us to have professors of quality, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
As of the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change the things.
The show business is full with tricks which copy the ones the others.
In a certain way, it is logical: all that is new is accepted with prudence and that lasts a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I dare to affirm that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural…
But pity is completely useless, because people with a handicap are not suffering beings, abandoned of all, that we must take in pity.
They are people who can live a life except for whole and open out, on condition that having of them the means necessary of course.
I often say that when people with a handicap manage to carry out something, it is not only one projection for them but for all the company.
Isn't your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified per many people?
If we want to do work of quality, we must be intransigent in many fields and require a certain discipline.
But I think that it is completely normal.
Certain people arrive on our premises with a romantic vision and the head in the clouds and, when they realize that they must come to the repetitions twice per week, follow the preparatory courses and spend much time on the roads for the concerts, they lose their enthusiasm quickly.
But that functions in the same way in each group which wants to work and achieve goals.
The group The Tap Tap currently counts twenty members.
How much between them were already there in 1998?
Only one, Láďa Angelovič.
We are an opened group, people enter and leave, one cannot nothing there.
Is always opened with those which want or would want to join us.
That will be the case the day before day envisaged of the end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012 as from 9 p.m.
This action will proceed in Prague in the Incheba arena, Brno with Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians of Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relay when is sung jointly the cancelled song of the group The Tap Tap “Fine of the world”.
The goal of the concert is to gather financial means (with height of 25 million CZK) to equip the training centre multipurpose Studeo which is in Prague in the Jedlička institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is of 400 CZK, the entry is free for the children up to 12 years, the prévente of the tickets is opened in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and cosmos.
Last week, during the ministerial meeting of the countries of the European space agency, Poland was allowed as twentieth member of this agency, it is the second Member State of the old Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became member except for whole on November 12th, 2008).
Poland had started a close collaboration with the ESA in 1994 and during years which followed took part in a number of projects of the agency.
The road of Poland towards space however began much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, of the impassioned Poles worked on space flights; they always did not meet comprehension.
I would like to evoke for example the conference of A. Šternfeld at the astronomical observatory of Warsaw, on December 6th, 1933, during which it presented ideas drawn from its work of avant-garde entitled “Introduction to astronautics”.
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the cold listeners and of the years later Šternfeld remembered that only Doctor Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld obtained in France the price Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his work “Introduction to astronautics”.
The aforementioned Doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became thereafter a large propagator of astronomy and astronautics.
It published hundreds of articles in the Polish newspapers and wrote many dedicated works with this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a propagator of the astronautics of world famous, its contribution was in particular rewarded by the fact that its name was given to the one of the craters of the hidden side of the Moon.
By 1925 was built in Poland a line inspection car intended to be been driven by a rocket motor.
One knows neither the author unfortunately nor the details of this project.
It is not clearly either if the rocket were to be used for propelling or braking the line inspection car.
The only information known on this line inspection car is those of the press of the time.
Starting from 1933, the Polish artillery started to be devoted to the rockets.
The researches were undertaken by the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It arises from the preserved documents that this research had reached the testing stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, research stopped.
In 1937, the plans of a photoelectric rocket of hunting, drawn by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the work “Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna I rakietobomba lotnicza” of an author called Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects had as a finality a military use of the engines of rockets.
Right before the war, all the projects of use of the technique of the rockets were carried out by the provisional advisory scientific committee (“Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy”), which coordinated all work.
This committee had been created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war put an end to its activities.
After the war, the other work devoted to aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to the company Polish astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it is question of a company in the number of November 1954 of the newspaper Problem, in which four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics are.
In one of these articles, written by professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company devoted to astronautics
At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had future.
With the beginning of the year 1956, the company Polish astronautics (PTA) made efforts to enter international the astronautics federation (created in 1951) and as of the autumn, the PTA became a regular member about it.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of international the astronautics federation.
It preserved its function until its death in 1959.
Starting from 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the crowned development of success of the weather rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific researches.
The first model, RM-1, were finished in 1957 and the first launching took place on October 10th, 1958.
This rocket of a range of 1800 meters had a 80 cm length and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Thereafter was built an improved version, RM-1A and, during the summer 1959, of the tests of flight of the rocket on two floors RM-2 were started in the desert of Bledov.
This rocket had a length of 1.4 meter and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - rocket RM-34 should have had a range going up to 14.5 km and have been used to observe the wind in altitude.
But in 1963, all work of development was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded the first rockets of the type RM.
This rocket, designed with two stages, had an overall length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were characterized by dimensions from reserved space to the scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space offering a volume of 0.4 liter, while in Meteor-1B this volume was of 0.34 liter and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 liter.
The maximum range of all these types of machine was of 37 km.
During the time 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first tests of flight began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.
Thereafter the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is still advisable to mention the entry of Poland with the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national committee COSPAR two years later.
Within the framework of the Interkosmos program, Poland also took part in space exploration on the artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second cosmonaut not-Soviet of this program.
The abrogation of the law on work of public utility is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional court repealed the law on work of public utility.
This decision raised in the public opinion a sharp discussion.
It is without any doubt interesting to examine these problems from a broader point of view.
The economic systems directed towards liberalism, as well in the EU as in the context of globalization, are founded on the principle of more than not regulated economic competition.
This means concretely that the various economic entities as well as the national economic systems are perpetually in conflict the ones with the others.
This results from the principle of freedom of trade and free circulation (without limits) from the private capital combined with an unrestrained financial speculation.
The considerable differences of the price of work (wages) generate a tension on the prices.
It is advisable to put under this term the following significance: a producer makes an effort by the importation of goods sold with bottom taken to resist economic competition in “expensive returning” the price of the competitor, with an aim of removing a greater market share and of thus increasing his own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either to transfer the production abroad, or to buy at low prices, or to disappear. The result is an important unemployment in the countries where the prices of work are high in comparison with other economies.
Since the private capital is not any responsible from the social point of view and consequently for responsibility with respect to the unemployment which it generates, the social contributions of the State necessarily increase.
All this situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and to thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused with the whole of the company by this race with the profit.
This situation is at such a point of public notoriety which it is not necessary to provide of the concrete statistical data.
The practices without scruples of the private capital generate in the various economies a situation in which the governments of the various countries are constrained to launch out in a mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social status of their own population with an aim of attracting the foreign assets on their premises.
In other words, the governments put their own population at the mercy of capital deprived without taking account of social collapse.
This appears mainly in the amendments of the laws in force.
The objective is to force its own population economically to accept the diktat of the prices of the private capital, in particular in the field of the wages.
This occurs on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and on the other hand by the restriction of the rights of the employees in the field of the industrial legislation.
It results an increasing poverty from it and the deepening from the differences between the rich person and the poor.
In FRG, there exists since years of the points of public distribution of food for the poor which cannot provide for their needs with their own work.
One already counts per million the number of these people.
Within the framework of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes completely current that the employees receive such wages that the State is seen constrained to pay a supplement so that they reach the vital minimum.
Such a scandal for example was updated in the case of the employees working like auxiliaries at the federal Parliament.
Measurements of saving in practically all the Member States of the south of the EU generate, without any doubt, a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of the company, people are constrained either to emigrate (as it was the case at the 19th century), or to live sparely with starvation wages, in margin of the company, in the hope which one day the private capital invests in their country.
Should here be raised the following question: from which will this capital come?
If it comes from other countries of the EU, then poverty will pass from a country to another; this capital can not come either, or then an Chinese, an Indian, Brazilian, a Turk, a Morrocan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of European wages.
This relates to also all the Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media affirm, to weary itself some, that the State cannot make investments in capital in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
The private capital defends the idea bitterly that the State cannot intervene in the economy by regulating interventions.
It should then be wondered whether the private capital does not influence and, even, does not direct today, depending on its egoistic own interests, the policy and by the same one, the entire State.
The answer to this question is without any doubt yes.
The proof is that there exists a lobby the practically Almighty and present in all the States.
It results a desperate plight from it appearing in the field from corruption, by the granting of mutual advantages, in the legislation, where all is condemnable but not punishable.
In FRG, the situation is such, that because of the lack of means financial, the national ministries delegate the development of the government bills to law firms closely related to industry.
These bills are then adopted at the Bundestag.
The totality of the power does not come from the people, as the constitutions of the Western type declare it, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is manifest that the democracies directed towards liberalism are seen now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in its work entitled “the crisis of the Roman empire at the time of César and of Pumped”: “The State was for a long time in full deliquescence and the functions were allotted by violence.
Blows of bribes, favours obtained illegally, and the stones and the swords were also used to obtain these stations.
The under the counter payments and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with already sold voices”… … “honest people at all did not seek themselves to obtain functions, it resulted from it once the State remained 8 months without consuls”…. 'One really started to say that the remedy for this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man”… It is true that Appianos with the spirit Had pumped, but it is César which transformed irréversiblement the democracy into absolutist mode.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the current society is founded on the preference of the personal profit, without regards for the interest of the company as a whole.
In its petrol, the private capital is not able any more to understand and put forward the interests of the company as a whole.
It results from it, today like formerly, a decline without preceding by the elites, any effort to carry out in-depth reforms.
We must thus seek the causes of the emergence of the fascistic and communist modes in liberalization without scruples of the economic systems of 19th and 20th centuries.
In the actual position of the things, one can consider the disappearance of these systems to the profit as of democracies of the liberal type a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are unaware of completely the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, the humanitarian crises and social of which we are the witnesses today as well as the crimes against humanity such as we know them from the ancient history and recent.
The abrogation of the law on work of public utility is not a solution, at least in the long run.
Under the pressure of economic competition, as well with the international plan as on the level interns European, the government of the Czech Republic will be constrained to continue to search means of decreasing the social status of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists into cubes reforms with sociopolitical aimings, which will reinforce the investments in capital of the State in the economy, will increase the influence of the citizens on the government and will weaken the position of monopoly of the capital deprived in the company with the profit of the State.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
“Nothing will never leave violence and never will not be able” declares Sting in the song entitled Fragile whose worms the main thing of the refrain is “do not forget how much we are fragile”.
“If my sons did not want wars, there would not be”, affirmed Gutele Schnaper, the woman of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violences between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, of many reactions rose.
Some opt for Israel, putting forward its right to the self-defence and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, calling upon the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide made against the Arabs of Palestine and regarding Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on the question of knowing which is guilty and which is victim, in its waves of recurring slaughters; altogether, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not live the beginning of violences.
I would like to offer to the readers a point of view located “behind the curtain”, on that with which benefit mainly from the tensions which have continued already for more than 95 years (as from the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a short period of country of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available under investigation, others come out from my own comprehension of that, or more exactly of the group of individuals, which is the principal instigator of the events of the modern history.
The history of humanity is before all the history of a fight for the power.
At each time, we can find a Alexandre the Large one or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is to know if these individualities acted in an independent way or if they owed their acts with the throne with somebody who directed their acts according to beforehand definite objectives.
We must admit that we live at one time when the world wealth is concentrated between the hands of some individuals and which this financial concentration generating certain powers could not be made during one only generation.
Among the families having an astronomical wealth is particularly distinguished the family Rothschild, which could be regarded as the head of the octopus (I am unaware of if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude it).
Little is written on their subject.
Of course.
As of the Nineties of the 19th century, they acquired the first world news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of bonds between their name and serious criminal acts with which they were mixed and which had always meant for them reinforcement to be able to them, an increase in their fortune or both.
They have major participations in almost most central banks of the world and prepare or carry out wars against the countries in which they do not have such participations yet (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries were of 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the inversion of Kadhafi only of 4, meanwhile Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Any person who tried to draw up herself against this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew in Bank of America of Rothschild the statute of central bank and started to emit during the civil war clean sound money (governmental, I hear well) and was assassinated in a theatre in 1865.
JFK started to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, it was assassinated in 1963, the deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 whereas it wanted to bring a lawsuit against the EDF to have started the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for being able on a world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a freemason initiated with the 33e degree, being the highest level.
The first war aimed to eliminate great official monarchies from Europe, the second was to remove colonialism, in particular British, and the third should reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create only one universal religion (oecumenism not being anything else that the starter of such a solution) and, with final, acquire an absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with at their head Rothschild consists in creating a crisis then to suggest a solution then (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to an aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the EDF intended to prevent that are not repeated crises as those which they caused in 1907).
After having succeeded in starting the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo de Ferdinand, Habsbourg heir with the throne Austro-Hungarian, they destroyed Russia tsarist by causing the revolution Bolshevik.
The First World War ended abruptly in a German capitulation without justifications economic and military (the war was not necessary any more to the destruction of Russia tsarist) and it was followed by the parcelling out of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier release of the Second World War, the bankers let the politicians create a conflict situation latent: they have, on the one hand, imposed on Germany of amazing war reparations thus generating the conditions of a toughening of the impoverished masses (it is enough for them then to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing finger of the culprits, suggesting simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created Czechoslovakia made up of various nationalities, including strong German minority which was to play the part (that it held indeed) of fifth column to spark off an explosion and to start a war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschield inspired the creation of the movement Zionist, of which one of the branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish State, preferably in the region of historical Judaea with Jerusalem like capital (return to Sion).
The declaration of Balfour mentioned above posed the bases of a massive emigration of Jews towards Palestine and the first frictions with the Arab local population started.
Terrorist acts were made on both sides.
The second world war burst; it is difficult to appreciate if Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had held it initially; or if all that it has fact were planned, the fact is however that the sufferings of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the bases of the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; same manner as the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel lit a hearth of fire which can cause a third world war.
If the international bankers manage to start this war, the Jewish population will be as it was it during the Second World War, the first victim of the combat, this time just as the Arab or generally Moslem population of the Middle-East.
Israel is like an immense laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but with the international level (it is enough to see how people divide bitterly between partisans and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is victim in the israélo-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong generates another wrong according to a circle of violence without end and where does one find, at the origin of all, the cupidity of certain individuals and their desire to acquire the power on the whole world?
It is necessary here to make the difference between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because like on our premises, the international bankers propose to people with the elections only their own candidates.
Current the Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascist, honest politician with respect to the international bankers, who does all in order to start a war with Iran, which could, because of the adhesion of this country to the cooperation organization of Shanghai (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc…) to extend to become a world war and, since Iran controls the strait of Ormuz by which 20% of all world oil forward (this naval corridor has a width only of 2 miles) and to generate a destruction of the worldwide economy.
Under which light the remarks made by David Rockefeller appear now in 1994: “The only thing which we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.”
In their idea, the new world order is a world of Masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is useful by the rest of the human population.
A world in which very new born sees itself establishing with the birth an electronic chip making of him a completely controlled being.
“That they force all the individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to be related to the hand or the face a brand to red iron, so that it can neither buy nor to sell that which is not called after this wild animal or the figure of its name.
It is necessary to understand: that which has good sense counts the figures of this wild animal.
This number designates the man and it is six hundred sixty-six.”
The Argo film: when all goes to most badly, to call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a bunch of demonstrators made up of islamist students took attack the American embassy of Teheran and retained hostages 52 diplomats.
They were to be released in return for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled in the United States, which had supported its mode for several decades.
The situation did not offer to the American administration of positive exit, it could not, indeed, give up the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic mode, it was not able to obtain the release of the hostages.
It was a heavy blow for the prestige of the United States, blow still worsened later by the fiasco of the attempt at release of the hostages by the force.
The sequestered diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following the negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate caused in the United States a wave of solidarity and a feeling anti-Iranian.
The Iranian rout strongly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter vis-a-vis Ronald Reagan with the presidential elections of 1980.
The Argo film, of the actor and director Ben Affleck, described an episode of this history which offered a small victory to America.
Just before it is occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated adventures, they were found in the residence of the ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to make them leave Iran thanks to a fantastic cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a team of turning come to make locations for the turning of a film with large show of science fiction.
Combination of the kinds
The plan of the expert in exfiltration Tony Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to make the legend more credible, of store specialized mentioned this project of film, of the press conferences were organized and a fictitious production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained a long time secret, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
The film of Affleck is an unusual combination several kinds.
It is on the one hand about a conceived political thriller in a realistic way but also one “to wrap movie”, the account at a stretch successful, of a treachery - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean' S eleven, twelve and thirteen.
Environments follow one another: sequences of documentary Teheran of style (in the subtitled sequences iconic photographs of the time of the events and the manner are presented whose, thanks to these photographs, these same situations were retranscribed in the film, it does not have there great differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes of the general headquarter of the CIA and other institutions with dressed up men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the telephone…
Ben Affleck succeeded in starting again his career in a remarkable way.
Of ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and its game of actor ceased causing ironic remarks.
Argo is its third feature film after the dark police officer “Gone Gone Baby” (2007) and the thriller “The town” (2010).
It is also the first film of Affleck which is not held in its town of origin, Boston.
The direction of the atmosphere of a place constitutes one of the characteristics which placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also shows this direction of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Teheran “is held” by Canada.
The best scenes of the film are held in streets, during the reconstruction of actual facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clearness which also suggests confusion and the unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and its collaborators obtain a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (team of turning in the bazaar of Teheran distorts it).
Too many actions to too many places
The director had to be satisfied with a subject not offering in fact that few palpitating scenes, with the cinematographic direction of the term.
It is left there extremely well, it adds sometimes certain elements with reality and there, the result is not always also elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis to the airport of Teheran is drawn aside by a telephone call in America and the continuation on the runway are drawn enough by the hair).
The weakness of Argo lies in its dissipated character, which had with the need for showing too many events to too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are completely charming in their role of Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have deserved a larger place and it is not, far from there, only in this case.
The film of Affleck misses a little dramatic tension, it is let see with a moderated interest, by appreciating the realization and the pre-1940s style of the Seventies.
It involves the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a recall of a history still, in a certain way, unfinished to date, and like illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of the secret services like omnipotent and omniscient, he gets the bargain.
Rules to inflate balloons, bananas and the circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com waiter, which investigates each year a public survey the bank charges absurdest, decided, now, to launch the competition of the regulation or the ideas coming from “absurdest workshop EU”.
“The fact that the EU considers, these last times, to adopt a quota of 40 percent of women for the direction of the European large companies was at the origin of our decision”, for the Právo newspaper the organizer of this investigation declared, Patrik Nacher.
Among the nonsenses mentioned, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify the insurance premiums for the men and the women.
Until now however, the women were favoured as regards the rates of the life insurances because they represent, objectively, a less risk for the insurance companies.
People can announce until the end of the year any other so incredible idea of “the workshop of the EU”.
“The vote will take place before the end of the month of February 2013”, Nacher informed.
Among the discussed regulations of the EU is, for example, the obligation to add components organic to the fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or prohibition to use the reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small quantity of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of the cages of hens, which involved the raising of prices of eggs.
Criticisms were also emitted in the past against the prohibition in fact to use the expression “butters to paste” or of the withdrawal of the sale of the classical bulbs.
The bananas of quality must have a size of 14 centimetres.
The European administration often reacts under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose requests are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (thus the Czech Republic currently imposes the requests for its banks while threatening to use its right to veto).
The interests of the lobbies are also, for example, at the origin owing to the fact that in the Union, the bananas should not be of a size lower than 14 cm nor to have a “abnormal curve”.
The European Commission defended itself while arguing that it did nothing but harmonize nonhomogeneous national standards which complicated the trade.
The standards concerning the fruit and vegetables were softened in spite of the opposition of certain States, applicant whom the existing directives involve a wasting of foodstuffs.
The first price will be can be decreed in this investigation with the regulation of the EU of last year according to which must be reproduced on the inflatable balloons a warning indicating that the children of less than 8 years should not inflate without monitoring of adults.
The EU has refers to an American investigation according to which the balloons are, among the toys, the first cause of death of children by smothering.
A similar restriction applies to the children of less than 14 years as regards blowing in trumpets of fair.
On our premises also, one has odd ideas.
The following rule concerning the European officials themselves is rather absurd: because of the sensitivity of this topic for Greece, any person having an official function within the EU cannot use the name “Macedonia” and owes, in the place, speech of FYROM (To form Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with association “Let Make” gathering liberal economists, the Bankovnípoplatky.com waiter named in this investigation, in addition to certain nonsenses mentioned above, the regulation of the Union relating to the volume of the reserves of food substances into the territory of Czech Republic.
The EU had fixed maximum volumes for the reserves of food substances being able to be on the territory of the Czech Republic the day of our adhesion at the EU.
The Czech Republic exceeded then, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and risked, so a door amends.
The organizers of this investigation considered to be interesting the idea to pay money sums with certain countries because they do not have an access to the sea and the idea to grant a subsidy to ask for the granting of subsidies.
These ideas are however not originating in Brussels but in Prague.
“The fact of not having sea handicaps us.
We will request from the European Union a refunding”. Thus expressed itself, with the autumn 2004, the Minister for the Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He asserted that, because of our production of wheat, and following the purchases known as “interventionists”, the State had been found with full stocks which he had then had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have poured us million euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the final analysis, the European Commission accepted the Czech request and organized an invitation to tender for the purchase of wheat coming from the countries without maritime access.
The subsidies for obtaining subsidies were proposed with the communes by the ministry for the Local development directed by the minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), those were, concretely, to be used to write requests for subsidies granted by Brussels.
The EU declares: “the odd regulations are rare”.
If the regulations often cause criticisms in the Member States, according to many experts, the efforts made by HAVE regulation improvement of the effectiveness of the operation of the Union like in the field of its general development, praises deserve rather.
More serious is, for example, according to the experts, the problem of the use of subsidies of the EU for projects which do not have absolutely anything to see with the reinforcement of European integration, but which was imposed by the Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic must, like other Convention countries, to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific denominations for these products traditional (fight which it does not leave always victorious) causes sharp emotions among Czechs.
So at the end six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs defended successfully the denomination “Olomoucké tvarůžky”, for what name “Tuzemský rum” which goes back on our premises to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it by the denomination “Tuzemák”.
Only the products containing cane sugar alcohol, and not containing beet sugar, can carry the rum denomination.
In the official list of the recorded products of the EU, one finds accompanied by cheeses universally known today like Feta or the Gorgonzola, the marsipan cake of Lübeck or Parma ham, biscuits of Karlovy Vary (“Karlovarské suchary”), carps of Pohořelice and Třeboň (“Pohořelický has Třeboňský kapr”) and hops of Žatec (“Žatecký chmel”).
The gingerbread of Pardubice (“Pardubický perník”) and the cakes called “Horns of Hořice” (“hořické trubičky”) can also be proud of their Community brand.
People want that I save the Republic, but I am only one amateur, declares senator Okamura
Mister the Senator, how does one have the idea to present himself to the presidential elections?
It is not to be a senator or president who counts for me.
If all functioned without problems in our country, I would not be candidate nowhere.
But I do not support more to see as the country has been plundered for these twenty last years, than the robbers are not under the bolts and the taxes and the age of the departure to the retirement increase.
I did not have the ambition to become politician.
But when I then see something which I do not like, I try to bring a solution so that changes.
And as I have more than forty years and that I am independent, member of any party, I do not have other solutions to influence the situation to only present itself to the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered to the Senate but you put yourselves quickly on the way for the Castle (N.d.T.: sit of the presidency).
Don't you thus turn your back on those which elected you?
I always said that I will launch out in the battle for the Castle according to the results of the senatorial elections
Thereafter, I specified that if I were elected senator, I would present myself to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, this one is only one instrument enabling me to carry out my vision.
This is why I need the largest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we give a death rattle with the bar or in front of our tv station, but it is also that we trample cough those which try to bring change.
To that the press is added who breaks the reputation of the people and confuses free speech with freedom to lie.
One, for example, affirmed on my subject that I bribe the journalists or that I was the advisor of Jiří Paroubek.
Let us come to your visions.
You started the fight for the Castle with like hobby horse the topics of the material and penal responsibility for the politicians and the retroactive tax declarations beyond twenty million [of CZK].
You must for this purpose change the law.
As a president, you do not have such a power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When as a citizen, I put pressure so that the activities of tourist guide constitute a liberal profession, I won the case.
The problem it is the backroom politics: when somebody arrives of left or right-hand side with a good project, this one is knowingly refused and that delays the citizens.
Like independent, member of any party, I am likely much more to obtain the support of all the parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and dogma partisans, to take each party what there is the best for our country and to apply it.
Do you regard yourselves rather as a left or man of the right?
From a Czech point of view, I have the feeling which people place me rather on the left.
For me, that it is a little on the left or on the right, it is not really important.
For me, important it is that we went from the front one.
What counts for me, it is not that people are of left or right-hand side but to gather people.
I always support any solution contributing to the community property, even if she is proposed by the Communist party or ODS and I acted also impartially against bad ideas.
Do you flare up when somebody known as of you who you are populist?
But what you declared doesn't prove it?
When you work out a plane business in a company, you have also a certain optimal goal and a vision.
You try to bring you closer.
Some can call that of the populism, but all the proposals of which I speak were applied by the world and about the recognized experts spoke about it.
But without the support of the Parliament, there remain to you only slogans.
You will not survive a long time in policy with that.
Do you think that if you will see people and their speech, you will make a success of, for example, to impose the material and penal responsibility?
I do not have another option.
It is necessary me to convince the politicians, the journalists and the public opinion and to try to rejoin them with my camp in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to live broadcast on television my request with the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and penal responsibility politicians, civils servant, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they do not want any.
When there is a strong personality which will identify the abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the election of the president by the direct suffrage, it was obtained thanks to the pressure of the public opinion.
I acknowledge, to the point, being an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and my visions.
I have just launched me in policy and I try to obtain the support of the majority for my program.
I try, only, to advance the things, and if that does not go, I will stop in six years and I will turn over in the private sector.
It is a little as if Okamura were to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a saver.
I know that only one person cannot make the difference, this is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to also present itself to the senatorial elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the quantity of work.
I have at least constant the journalist of investigation Jana Lorencová which revealed the frauds with fuel oil.
I presented myself because people are really disgruntled but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of people did not vote and what have it fact have, for the majority, given their voice to a representative of the Establishment.
With the Senate, we are only two independent.
People elected a Senate which will be able to impose changes with difficulty.
Despite everything, I will fight for my vision, for example the election by the direct suffrage of the mayors and the regional prefects.
Do you plan to found your own party?
Not, not yet, because I do not have time to check if the past of each potential member is without spot and then I do not have financial means.
I do not have either money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my “transparent” account.
Don't you have money?
Do you speak about tax declarations, which is yours?
I estimate at approximately 60 million the value of my personal goods.
I have in Prague a ground of a value of 25 million, an apartment of a value of ten million, another apartment being worth 8 million, a collection of works of art of a value of approximately ten million, an Aston Martin which is worth 3.5 million and Škoda Superb of a value of 1 million and a few million on my account.
It should be said in passing, I have an Aston Martin, because it one was dreamed of kid: I always loved James Bond, who drived car, was gallant with the women and fought against the evil and the abuses.
Do you roll in Aston Martin, do you have a heritage of a value of 60 million and don't you have money for your countryside?
Do you want to change the Republic but don't you want to invest your own money there?
It is not very convincing.
I do not have 15 million for this countryside.
Should I involve in debt me?
I already invested 2 million and half in the countryside.
The fact that I do not have any sponsor shows well that my program does not arouse a great interest.
I do not have the obligation to pay this countryside of my pocket.
My expenses of countryside are covered overall by the remuneration which I will receive as a senator.
But I could not live on it, for example to pay the English school of my son who costs 30 thousand per month.
If my only objective were to earn money, I will not present myself to any election.
Will you thus continue your marketing activities to be able to live?
Hadn't you affirmed that you would put your activities out of silencing device?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take over in spring the leadership of the travel agency.
People would like that I would be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
It is however necessary well that I live on something.
Which was your usual monthly salary when you were entrepreneur?
I gained and I continue to gain between two hundreds and four hundred and thousand.
If I were president, I would put an end to my marketing activities.
You will find this interview in the edition of Saturday of the Práva newspaper.
The architects of cabinet MVRDV prove that the true adventures are not only business of imagination. To be convinced some, it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of books lately set up - 2 photographs
“I find that this building is funny, the weather is very futuristic, finally something of interesting to see”, us says Lisette Verhaig, busy on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a data processing specialist in a close large company, tells us: “Yes, it is indeed quite beautiful, this building”.
But I wonder why we still need today a library.
Everyone has Internet, a iPad and e-books.
Today, nobody any more does go from full sound liking in one of these old-fashioned libraries, not?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town which does not have anything of attracting with the doors Rotterdam, holds a rather particular record.
The commune of 80.000 hearts displays the lowest rate of the education of the Netherlands.
In order to give again some neurons with the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general knowledge and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges which are reproduced on the tickets of euros in the form pretty small painted reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
Thus the authorities of the city realized that there was only one way of taking again the hand on the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, of the office of architects of Rotterdam MVRDV, Master of the diagrams in daring and creative sticks of buildings full with spirit and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and presented himself to competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a snigger on the face.
And while the members of the jury still looked at themselves, disconcerted and raising the shoulders, Maas, the shameless one, piled up its books of choice by order of size to make a pyramid of it, and finished its backed up speech of arguments activists by one: “dear commune!”
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or like one says, Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros spouted out of ground.
The building falls under a project of revitalization also comprising an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and some buildings and semidetached houses for a total of 50 dwellings.
At the beginning of November, the mountain of books received the second prize “Best Library of NL 2012”.
Moreover, the project was selected for National Dutch Wood Award 2012.
Thus this small village dull, which until today had nothing more to offer that pedestrian precinct postmodern and town hall by ugliness confusing, whose white frontages invite to think that they shelter a dairy, grew rich by a contemporary architectural work.
Most important, it is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building of its history.
The long way towards the reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese cover.
Admittedly, an elevator transports you in the middle of the solid mass, but the true joys of the reading and architecture open with you when you press the ground of the building on a tour of his topography.
The entirely made interior of glass is luminous and clear, the ground out of clinker bricks and the reverberators elegant speak unambiguous the language about the municipal public places.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
One seeks already glance of the public benches, dogs and little boys and little girls who play ball.
And everywhere of the books, the books and still of the books.
“Normally, the rays of library are along the frontage and in the medium is a large room and sinks, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal”, explains Willy Maas.
We completely upset the classical space configuration and opened spaces of reading of the interior towards outside.
The interior of the mountain of books was skilfully arranged: in the medium are the offices, library Internet, the club of failures, the center for the environment and the technical power station of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes skirtings, sometimes balustrades, sometimes of the slopes of staircase.
A new experiment for the sight, the touch and the sense of smell.
Even the architects and the hardened engineers of the building do not want materials unknown.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials”, explains Joop Trouborst, chief of the project near the commune of Spijkenisse, in an answer to the Standard.
Thus one day we found in a Friesian agricultural company a waste ad hoc resulting from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, one uses since years of the synthetic membrane of a millimetre thickness like substrate in the greenhouses and the fields.
They is cheap and time is saved.
The fine membrane is used during one or two seasons, then one can throw it.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time into cubes such quantities, in plates a four centimetres thickness.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the “Landbouwplastic” (KPL) changes color and is transformed into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose odor evokes at the same time a new car and sport shoes.
At the top of 105 steps the top of the mountain is.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary coffee offers a unspoilable view to us on the city, but also of the Dutch croquettes and the ficuses out of pots.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they contribute especially to the maintenance of the ideal level of moisture of the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the new heart
“It is incredible, but despite everything surfaces of glass, this building is a model project as regards ecology”, Trouborst entrusts.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermics.
Though the mountain of books is below a cloche, the sun illuminates only little time the interior, even the days of good weather.
The thick beams out of wooden assembled of through compared to the frontage of glass are used as sun visor, intercepting most of the rays.
The surrounding air is very pleasant.
The completely automated blinds take care moreover.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic data processing specialist, already went so far as to enter the new library.
Lisette Verhaig also was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professeure of Chinese traditional medicine, described even Boekenberg like “the finally found heart” of Spijkenisse.
There is a few weeks indeed, during the unveiling, each citizen was invited to donate a book resulting from its personal library.
This measurement made it possible to fill the vacuums of the library which was not yet completely furnished (today, it counts 70.000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The rays overflow of all shares.
For the architect Winy Maas, “there is nothing worse than a library with empty half.”
“I believe that our invitation created a certain relation between each citizen and this new building.
Each one knows that its book is part of this building.
Even if it is only for decoration.”
Thus MVRDV reached the main discipline which one calls, in the professional jargon, “the creation of an identity”.
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Even if it can appear young and little educated.
It is finally about a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: “the Germans must play a greater part.”
Germany chose the abstention at the time of the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert of the relations between the United States and the EU, this decision put Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the request of Palestinian to obtain the statute of observant State at the United Nations.
But it then chose the abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must show prudence, because it maintains the particular relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support either the American position.
Germany wanted to affirm its independence, without however showing itself too critical towards Israel.
At the time of the insurrection in Libya of March 2011, Germany had also chosen the abstention at the time of the vote on the installation from a zone of air exclusion.
Finally, NATO imposed this measurement.
Does Germany have difficulty of adopting a clear position in connection with the great international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is re-examining its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so to speak definite by the Americans and to found a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans thus encounter several faces.
It is waited them until they play a more independent part, but they are not accustomed there.
I believe that they still grope to find this role, but are on the way of a foreign politics “more normal”.
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
What then means concretely the term of foreign politics “normal” for the Germans?
It shows the will to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to the national files.
I believe that the German foreign politics is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and his relationships to certain areas, like Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of the other great powers: this is why Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the position of Germany with respect to the conflict in the Middle East and the abstention at the time of the vote of the United Nations?
Germany has initially important outlets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
This is why Berlin must take care not to run up against the public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
It is without any doubt a crucial factor.
However, I would not grant too much importance to it, because it is not about exclusively unilateral relation.
But it is there in any case a crucial factor in the German strategic reflections.
Does Germany harm its relations with the United States by choosing the abstention at the time of important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that Europeans and the Americans understand the German position perfectly.
This is why I think that the fracture is not so serious that it was it in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even as Germany only will be respected of it.
Indeed, Germany thus showed that it must be taken with serious as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, the opinions concerning the Palestinian initiative are varied.
On the other hand, the United States announced their veto of a clear voice.
Do the opinions differ between the United States and the majority from the European countries?
There always were differences because of the scene American domestic policy.
I believe that the Administration Obama secretly shown a great comprehension towards the European position.
But considering the political configuration of the country, the government cannot of course defend its position publicly.
I believe that the true differences in opinions are not so large that they always appear it.
If you observe the relations between Obama and Israeli the Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing of enthusiasm with regard to the policy of Netanyahou.
Does Germany have difficulty of reconciling its close relationships with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the large European partners, on the other hand?
I think that does not facilitate the things for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today, it is not the case.
They cannot thus be registered within a vaster political line and must affirm their singular position.
It is what they currently do in the question of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will assume a role of engine in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not simple for Germany, in particular because of relations with Israel.
This question was always delicate.
But in my opinion, the Germans are quite conscious owing to the fact that they must play a part which marks their independence more.
Does Germany see itself playing a part of serious actor on the international scene, Germany wants it only to assume one key function?
Or does she always have difficulties in assuming leading roles?
Germany is still not accustomed there, that is always uncomfortable for him and, in obvious reasons, the country always has difficulty of playing a more important part.
If one looks at, for example, the crisis of the euro, one notices that with each time Germany decides to weigh more, of many feelings antiallemands are made hear.
That does not facilitate the things for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: one does not want to be encircled hostile countries.
This point seen, Germany is in a position much more delicate than the United States.
It must compose with neighbors and opinions very varied, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on the European policy do nothing but decrease, but currently, the EU does not fill this vacuum, then which does it does remain?
The Germans will have simply to play a more important part.
And even if they do not like that, even if that their is unpleasant and if they only are appreciated of it, it is life!
Stephen Szabo is the assistant editor of Transatlantic Academy of Washington, an institute in which academics and experts in policy of Europe and North America analyze the challenges of the transatlantic community together.
Szabo is also member of German Marshall Fund, where it specialized in German policy, American foreign politics and transatlantic relations.
“Protection of the brands” in China: when Puma and Armani become suddenly Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are brands known throughout the world.
Does Armani Sports shirt… of what really act?
Behind this name a registered trademark in China is hiding place officially, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The brand enjoys thus a protection such as the company which is called from there cannot carry felt sorry for.
And even if it could it, it is not sure that she would win the case.
“It is increasingly difficult for the foreigners to protect their brands in China”, explains Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the cabinet Taylor Wessing specialized in violation of the property right in the Far East.
Each week, a new file arrives on my desk.
The imitators need only some additional letters to be able to record their brands.
Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is recorded, and instead of Prada, one records Prada-Kny.
German companies are also made copy in all legality, like Puma, the manufacturer of sports equipment.
Pattloch opens a sorter in which the recordings carried out near the office of the brands of Beijing are.
On September 14th, 2010, a Chinese company deposited the brand Zegna DF Puma, a denomination which the firm artificially created by adapting part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the house of mode.
It is a known fact which the Chinese became the world champions of the copy and the violation of the intellectual property.
In the big cities, one finds shopping centres on several floors which sell practically only counterfeits.
The cases of Pattloch are however different: its constituents give the responsibility it to attack the fact that the Chinese office of the brands officially confers to the Chinese companies the right to use a denomination which is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak about “Mingpai Bang”, of brand relationship.
The term is derived from “Dakuan Bang”.
It is with this term that the women are designated who marry with rich men.
The Chinese authorities say not to have anything to reproach itself.
“They is bad for the business, it is necessary to fight against this trend”, requires Pattloch.
“The brand is edulcorated, the singularity disappears, the damage for the reputation are enormous.”
The financial losses and the legal expenses amount to million for the sectors concerned, especially with regard to the expensive featured products.
According to the data of the company of research market CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third worldwide market of luxury items and that which develops most quickly.
However, it is not easy to erase the doubtful recordings of the register of the brands and these procedures are expensive.
These last can last up to nine years, and the exit is never certain.
Pattloch mentions the lawsuits at the time which the court rejected the complaint, because after one long period, the criticized denomination had become a “reality of the market”.
Pattloch explains us why if the plaintiff does not have a chance, it can even be obliged to pay money with the plagiarist, because it would have harmed his brand in China.
In this field, it is sometimes the law of the jungle which dominates.
Famous cases relate to also graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the manufacturer of machine of Sany building site, the same company which had just repurchased the producer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.
This is why the Chinese can use an emblem which resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, the acquisitor of Volvo, used before a blue logo and white which pointed out that of BMW. The conflict was regulated and Geely had to modify it.
The house of mode Lacoste had lost against the plagiarists of Hong Kong and Singapore who had reorientated the glance of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of nothing.
The office of brands CTMO in Beijing however admits to have known some difficulties in 2010 because of a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would have spent last year of a “emergency in the course of work to a found normality”.
Thus, the number of the untreated procedures of opposition would have dropped by 22%.
Nearly 57.000 cases of this type would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81.500 procedures remain in suffering with the office.
To act is expensive
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
The year spent, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million requests for deposit of brand, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, it is about a record and that means that China is for the tenth consecutive time at the top of the ranking for the number of the new deposits in the world.
That would also be worth for the full number of the legal brands, which is of 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office would have entered 1.8 billion yuan of registration fee.
In other words, each recording brought back on average 1.280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, like illustrates it the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has fought against a Chinese plagiarist.
Admittedly, the Germans could obtain that the illegal manufacturing of components of vehicle is suspended.
However, the imitator could maintain its rights Chinese on the Freudenberg brand.
“It is our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany”, explains Hanno Wentzler, president of the direction of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The office of the brands had thus rejected the objection of the Inhabitants of Munich.
Freudenberg won certainly the case near the two following authorities, but the opposing party continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is of setting
Today, the business is in authority near the Supreme court.
Wentzler is trustful, he believes in a positive exit of the lawsuit and praises the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: “the procedure is long, testing and much time and money costs us.”
It is also difficult to evaluate the internal costs. The service of the archives has even due to review the hundred last year old acts in order to bring evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain with the opposing party “large summons in euros with six digits” to regulate the litigation.
“It is with that which one sees what that represents for us”, Wentzler entrusts.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overflow as far as Europe.
It would be the case so imitators of this area made sure the exploitation of the not protected brands.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit in Germany the name of Freudenberg for a company of production of shoe and leather.
The company had for a long time given up this sector, but it had been able nevertheless to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: “vigilance is of setting”.
Pattloch and advise to him with the German companies to show a greatest caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to trust the international law of the brands, the foreigners should rather “also record in China all that is likely to be protected”, like says it Wentzler.
If not, the costs can be much more important than those of the recording.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle at the time of the last act of its legal drama, the company should pay fees of licence with the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains it.
Or then, we would lose our place on the segment of the market in question.
World day of fight against AIDS: to type foot, to sing, help
The Imbongi choral society repeats in Heidelberg, and the orphans of the AIDS of Swaziland are delighted by their arrival.
Here history of a bond which crosses much more than one distance of 8.733 kilometers.
Initially, foot is typed: the boots of cowboy, the tennis shoes, the pumps for the ladies and the moccasins for the men seek the rhythm by striking the ground of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the singers develop slowly - viola, low, tenor and soprano -, they are carried, bewitched and are followed.
Fiete Hopf, orchestra conductor the 29 year old loses almost its shoes of fabric when it directs the orchestra with his gestures of a wild flexibility.
We are Monday evening, the Imbongi choral society repeats a new song in the room of music of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years came, of the geneticist in human medicine to the house-husband.
“Om' Obani” is not an easy piece, each chorus-singer has different words, the whole in a very exotic language: the Zulu, a spoken language by 11 million people in South Africa, in Botswana, in Lesotho, in Malawi, in Mozambique and in certain areas of Swaziland.
To be helped to help itself
The ONUSIDA, the program of the United Nations of fight against AIDS, estimate that 34 million people throughout the world is reached disease.
23.5 million of them lives in the South of Africa.
Swaziland counts 245.000 infected people.
Moreover, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
180 orphans of the AIDS of the village of Esitjeni found godfathers in Germany thanks to association “Voices for Africa”.
70 of them attend an establishment of secondary education.
For 15 or 20 euros per less, one can become godfather.
This sum guarantees to the child of the money for the school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal in the center sucker.
Imbongi means into Zulu “storyteller of stories” or even “singer of praises”.
Nobody can usually speak the Bantu language in this area, but all can sing it.
Since nearly 10 years, the choral society repeats songs in this foreign language which it brought in Germany for now returning it to her native area: south of Africa.
Because with 8.733 kilometers as the crow flies of Heidelberg, in the North-West of the Kingdom of Swaziland, Esitjeni is, the village which depends on the vocal power of the German choral society.
40% people reached
The village counts approximately 2.000 inhabitants, some live in modest huts of straw or of ground and the majority of them is children.
More than 300 between them are orphan, because the VIH carried their parents.
In Esitjeni, one can observe with more small scale the evils who overpower Swaziland: the rate of infection with the highest VIH and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to the UNICEF.
The population practically never accepts the male circumcision, a measurement which however guarantees a proven reduction of the risk of infection of half.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland is carrying the virus of the immunodeficiency and it is not rare to die in the middle of about thirty.
At the time of a travel of group in Africa in spring 2005, the choral society had been able to discover the village. Imbongis especially saw many children in the street with which it missed not only the parental care, but also quite simply all: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
At the beginning, they were only some people who personally committed themselves pouring a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to the school and to offer a hot meal per day to him.
But hardly one year later, the choral society founded “Voices for Africa”, an association which is since then occupied in an almost professional way of the orphans of the AIDS of Esitjeni.
Facts in connection with the infections sexually transmissible
Which are the sexually transmitted diseases most current?
Among STI bacterial, one counts syphilis, chlamydiées and the blennorrhoea (or gonorrhoea).
STI current are the VIH, the virus of the human papilloma, the genital herpes or hepatitis.
The pubic louses and the scale belong to STI parasitic.
Which are the groups mainly concerned?
Syphilis and the blennorrhoea often appear at the men who have sexual relationships with other men.
The Institute Robert-Koch estimates that the sexual contacts between men are at the origin of at least four cases of syphilises on five declared in Germany.
In the adult heterosexuals, the infections related to chlamydiées, the trichomonase, the candidiasis (fungic), the blennorrhoea and the virus of the human papilloma are current sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of propagation of the VIH between adult heterosexuals is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of the new infections with the VIH are observed within this group.
In the young people, one observes a rate of infections related to chlamydiées appreciably higher than at the other groups of population.
According to European statements, the three quarters of all the infections relate to the young ages from 15 to 25 years.
Moreover, in Germany, the virus of the human papilloma is current in the young people.
Which is the evolution amongst infections?
It is not obligatory to declare all the sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Institute Robert-Koch, the number of the cases of syphilis more than doubled in 10 years: the figure passed from 1.967 in 2001 to 3.698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of the new infections with the VIH falls.
In 2011, there were approximately 2.700 cases.
That represents a reduction in a tenth compared to the previous year.
Which are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
The infectious diseases can cause abscesses on the level as of genitals, of the urinary pains, the vaginal discharge, the pains to the stomach as well as the appearance of buttons and warts.
However, they regularly do not involve any pain or another symptom and thus remain hidden.
How to protect itself?
The condoms can decrease the risk of infection, but they do not protect at 100%.
The reason is that the disease-causing agents of the sexually transmitted diseases can be also transmitted by lubricating infection or close body contacts.
The experts thus recommend to any person often changing sexual partners to pass regularly from the examinations.
Most STI quickly detected can be cured and the late after-effects can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, with the gifts, but especially at the funds which the chorus-singers thanks to their voices collect through whole Germany, the means accumulate.
“In all, we already sent approximately 200.000 euros to Esitjeni”, Annette Lennartz, president of association specifies.
At the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a sure woman of oneself and which always obtains what she wants, manages the money coming from Germany.
It also takes care that the orphans are well placed, at one their grandmothers for example.
Suckers, thus one calls the old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them accommodate to 14 orphans, they offer a roof to them and take care that they go each day per hour to the school in their uniforms.
The orphan who does not have anybody any more is accommodated in a sure place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by association, just like the two cookers which prepare each day the meals for more than 200 famished children.
Moreover, “Voices for Africa” created a school of seam and licence the construction of two hen houses. With the participation of the American organisation for health PSI, association organized a screening test of the VIH for many inhabitants.
That does not go from oneself, because even if the disease is quite visible in all the country, it remains a subject taboo.
A king and his 14 wives
“The AIDS is a true taboo”, explains Annette Lennartz, “because it is a subject which touches sexuality.”
They is rather curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of the Black Africa, the King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of the democracy.
These manners sanctioned by the State, inter alia, are responsible for the fast propagation of the VIH observed these last decades.
Migrant worker also disseminated the virus through the country.
One however finds condoms with each corner of street, adds Annette Lennartz, “but almost nobody uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh.”
In order to support the cultural exchange somewhat, the chorus-singers of Imbongi travelling outfit leave all both or three years in the South Africa and strike up filled up songs of nostalgia, of courage, confidence and black identity that many inhabitants of the point of the black continent still know time of apartheid.
The bus filled with white which sing in African language is a means of recognition such as it generates not only good mood and joy, but tears off sometimes also a tear with some frightening frontier guards.
The bus always takes them along to Esitjeni, where the chorus-singers visit their godsons.
Even if it is difficult to find the small village on a chart, Esitjeni is well-known in the valley of Ezulweni.
“In Esitjeni, you Go will find light there”, people say over there.
And after a travel 8.733 kilometers as the crow flies, of return to Heidelberg, in front of these chorus-singers who type foot in the room of repetition of Bergheimer Straße, one finds also the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe brought back evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The layer of ice could reach 20 meters thickness.
American space agency NASA proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as three studies published explain it this Thursday in the specialized magazine “Science”.
The Messenger probe brought back evidence of the existence of a cover of ice in the area of planet permanently plunged in the shade.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimetres being able to go up to 20 meters.
Water probably comes from comets or perhaps from asteroids which would have run up against Mercury.
However, nobody establishes link between the water discovery and the assumption of a presence of life on planet, explains in chief scientist of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other essential components with the life arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Unperceived of the inhabitants of our planet, the probes, the telescopes and the small robots as Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
Time with other, they send images to the ground, such of the small interstices through which one observes the infinite one.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers of Institut Max-Planck.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Cérès.
Comme Pluton, who orbits around the Sun behind Neptune, Cérès is not regarded as a “planet”, according to the new definition of the term of the international astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infra-red photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a “portrait of family” of the innumerable generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink points, more difficult to identify, are the “new-born babies” in the room of childbirth of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this area where are born the stars, baptized “W5”, a name well not very romantic, in the constellation of Cassiopée, at 6.500 light-years.
The Spitzer telescope of NASA photographed the blazing glare of a star dying.
The circle in the fritter shape is composed of elements which the star projects when she dies.
In immense Trifide nebula, at 5.400 light-years of the Earth, gas and dust new stars form.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this room of galactic childbirth.
Pleiads, star cluster also called “seven sisters”, can be observed by the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope more emphasizes the colors.
On this photo infra-red, the nebula of Propeller, like a red eye, looks at the spectator directly.
It is at 700 light-years in the constellation of Aquarius.
Its resemblances to a terrestrial continent were worth the title of North America to him.
The combination of the photo normal and the photo infra-red makes it possible to observe a spectacular colour.
Only the infra-red detectors of the Spitzer telescope could capture an image of new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmas of astronomy relates to the creation of the Saturn's rings.
A theory is that the rings are the remains of the Saturn moon which disappeared there is 4.5 billion years without leaving traces.
One of the largest photographs and clearest that the telescope Hubble took is that of the galaxy of the Swirl.
According to the colour, the photographs of the spiral galaxies can become true works of art.
The photography published by the European southern Observatory shows the nebula of Trifide in the constellation of Sagittarius, to several thousands of light-years.
The name of Trifide comes from the Latin word “trifidus” (divided, shared into three), because three trails of dust divide the shining heart of the birthplace of stars.
The astronomers photographed the first steps of a cosmic pile-up in the constellation of the Serpent eater: to 400 million light-years of the Earth, the cores of two galaxies in fusion precipitate one towards the other, the collision is inevitable.
The telescope Hubble observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you do not like the technical abbreviations, you can use his nickname of “southern wheel of fire”.
The photograph of the space telescope Hubble shows a detail of the nebula of the Iris, in the constellation of Céphée.
Nebula is at 1.400 light-years and is made up of grains of dust which are ten to hundred times the smaller than current domestic dust.
This photo was elaborate starting from the optical and radiographic stereotypes taken by various telescopes.
One can see there the circle made up of the black holes who is to 430 million light-years of the Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies baptized Arp 273.
The scientists named largest spiral galaxy “GC 1810”.
In this nebula the group of the young stars most luminous of our Milky Way is.
The celestial cradle always gives rise to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the nebula of the Rivet washer, also permanently create young stars at 5.000 light-years of the Earth.
In this galaxy with the light rays and opening of a small black hole, there does not exist yet of dust, it is only gas.
The scientists think that it was born the bigbang shortly after, when the universe was mainly made up hydrogen.
Our glance on the universe: principal telescopes
The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it later one year to observe stars.
Since, the mirrors of the optical telescopes did not cease growing bigger and thanks to them, it was possible to see always further in the universe.
During 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the telescope Hauls Observatory of the mount Palomar close to San Diego was the largest telescope of the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, in the United States, Broad Binocular is Telescopes.
It makes it possible to observe the universe through two mirrors having each one a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of Gran Telescopio Canarias with Palma, in the Canary islands, is immense. The mirror with him only reached a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of Broad Southern African Telescopes in South Africa was segmented in order to save money.
The diameter reaches approximately eleven meters all the same.
The disadvantage of the method of construction economic is that the telescope is fixed at the level of the vertical angle, which in limit mobility.
The telescope Hobby-Eberly in Texas is also fixed at the level of the vertical angle.
Its characteristic is due to its great capacity of collection of light.
In spite of a diameter of relatively small mirror, this capacity approaches those of largest reflecting telescopes of the world.
The scientists listen to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using the radio telescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person owner of a computer can help in the “Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence” (SETI, or “research of the extraterrestrial intelligence”) by using the computing power of her machine.
Sight on the southern European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here Broad Very is Telescopes (“very large telescope”), an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can light the average infra-red spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (Broad European Extremely Telescopes) is also planned for the site of the ESO in Chile.
Its principal mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of almost 1.000 elements to mirrors.
However, the telescope will not be able to take stereotypes before 2018 as soon as possible.
Until 2007, the two telescopes of Keck on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were regarded as largest of the world.
They raised two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each one.
The telescopes of Keck are part of the observatory of Mauna Kea who observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new gigantic telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration makes it possible to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come to us from the space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24th, 1990, it delivers images of the distant worlds to us.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler seeks extrasolar planets, primarily those which are livable.
NASA announced on February 2nd, 2011 that it had found 1.235 planets candidates since the beginning of the mission.
This photograph illustrates the final preparations before the launching of the space telescope Kepler.
The space telescope James-Webb (JWST) will be sent in space as soon as possible in 2018 on board a rocket ARIANE 5.
The first mirror of the infra-red space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope will have in particular the role of finding light projected by first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
The scientists think that the Mercury south pole shelters also ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, because Messenger orbits much more close to the Mercury north pole.
The data radars indicated since decades the presence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launching of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to be orbited around Mercury, the scientists have the certainty now of it.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Even a museum of longevity there is found.
An investigation into a country, in which one is still relatively young to 97 years.
In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Even a museum of longevity there is found.
An investigation into a country, in which one is still relatively young to 97 years.
The travel in the Talysh mountains is of a dishevelled romanticism.
With the turning of the many turnings of the road, the small bus jolts along timbered hills, of torrential rivers and modest farms.
All is green and fertile, one would believe oneself almost in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the major South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only with a few kilometers.
It is here that the Caucasian ethnic group of the name of Talysh lives, by the way which large-thing is not known, if it is not that they speak perfectly the Persan one and the Azeri and that they have a very great longevity.
Terminus: Lerik.
The plastronne small town with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era which does not agree at all with the picturesque landscape of mountain.
The European tourists are rare here, the way since the capital of Azerbaijan, Bakou, is well too painful.
It takes eight hours to traverse the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one way.
The province did not benefit yet from the legendary wealth that the country must with its crude oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years, is persuaded that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
“Bakou became celebrates in May thanks to the competition of Eurovision, and the next year, there will be here the festival of the oldest people of the world”, explains Fatulayeva.
It is director of the museum of longevity, the only museum of the kind in the world.
One can discover there the life of approximately eight tens of Talysh of the area which have more than 100 years. Fatulayeva shows us a monochrome photo.
Here my grandfather, it reached the 120 years age.
To have still a child at 136 years
But the star discussed of the museum is Șirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
There does not exist however birth certificate.
And when it is thought that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems more than doubtful.
“It was born in 1805 in this area, it died in 1973”, Fatulayeva specifies.
The man would have married three times and it would have had 23 children. At the 136 years age, it would have still designed a girl.
Would Șirali Müslümov have been mistaken in a few decades by calculating its age?
Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist at the Institute Max-Planck de Rostock, also heard to him of the man at the great age of Central Asia.
“Surprisingly old people also live in certain areas of China, in Japan or in the valley of Hunza in Pakistan”, explains Scholz, “in Sardinia also, there are men who live incredibly old.”
However, it is impossible to establish a scientific proof because of the inexistence of the documents, not counting there was no civil register.
Each day, glass of melted butter
It is nevertheless in fact that people of the area of Lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years.
Which is thus the reason of longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks that it is a question of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the meals rich in calories of Talysh, which like the meat, the bread and especially the dairy products and of which much drinks melted butter glass daily, are good for health.
Or is this the simple lifestyle which preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village close to the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years, it is still relatively young for the area.
Mirzayeva, which affirms to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wood house, as it is typical to see some in all the area of the Caucasus.
She sat on the ground beside a churn, of which she beats the contents indefatigably.
Eight people live here under only one roof, among which one of the sons of Mirzayeva and a girl, who are for a long time adult.
Two small children also gambol in the house.
In the kitchen, one prepares tea for the guests been used in typical glasses armadus in the shape as belly.
The white teeth of Mirzayeva are aligned perfectly, and under its scarf long braids of fair dark hide that his/her son reveals us with pride.
I always washed my hair with milk, and thus I never lost them and that they kept their color.
“I never used shampoo”, Mirzayeva adds.
The monthly retirement is enough to live
She always ate what comes from its clean firm: tomatos, potatoes and garden peas.
Of all my life, I never bought least food in a supermarket.
Then, she speaks to us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But very improved when the “beloved father” Heydar Aliyev took the orders.
The language of propaganda astonishes in the mouth by an old woman.
However, the worship of the paternal figure of the nation, a man who however directed his country like a dictator, almost does not know limits as Azerbaijan
It was with the power until 2003, his Ilham son succeeded to him thereafter.
At all events, the elderly people of Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva monthly receives 230 manats (approximately the same amount as in euros) for its retirement, a sum which guarantees a good progress of life in the area.
And perhaps that the son for a long time greying of Mirzayeva is right: “the elder ones enjoy a great respect in our culture”.
They are the center of the large family, they are liked, looked after and happy.
Here is a good reason to live more possible for a long time.
“Human rights” omitted in the Constitution
The revolution reappears in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations reveal the major fracture of the country.
The constitution project based on the charia is violently discussed.
The Egyptian president is not miserly filled up words of emotions.
We must make a success of the transition.
“And this success is of my responsibility towards the people and God”, he declared on television State.
Its speech was intended to the entire people, but also especially with the Coptic Christians, with the liberals, Muslims enlightened and laic.
Because all the members of the confused and hopelessly divided opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile with the hands of the powerful Muslim brothers.
Mohamed Morsi declared, almost while excusing himself, temporarily to have restricted competences of the Constitutional court and to have widened to them his “in order to save the revolution”.
However, the Egyptians and the world do not know really what this 61 year old wants to save engineer, holder of a doctorate of the American university of California of the South.
Will the judicial power be reversed?
The 234 articles written with haste by the constituent assembly mainly Islamic of 100 people at the time of fifteen hours a night amazing feat are indeed worrying to a certain extent.
As in previous constitutions, the project provides that jurisprudence rests on “the principles of the Islamic right”.
But what means really the word “principles”?
It was and that remains always a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that the islamist ones use the vague formulation and the legal manoeuvre margin which results from this to apply a more strict interpretation of the charia.
In any case it is which an article lately introduced stipulating gives rise to think that, with regard to all the subjects touching with the charia, the university al-Azhar must be consulted. The establishment is the Islamic institution most important of the country and its glare radiates on everyone Islamic Sunnit.
That can, but does not want inevitably to say that the clergy will monitor the legislative device, which would de facto involve the setting under supervision of the judicial power.
Many items in the constitution project are matter with interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the probable maintenance of the military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts got busy to repress the opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, to 11.000 civilians were held by the soldiers.
The State also must, one can read in the project, to protect “true nature from the Egyptian family” and “to promote its morals and its values”.
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that the institutions of the State could even control the contents of art cinematography and the literature.
In light, it would be quite simply about censure.
Moreover, no article expressly guarantees the equality between the men and the women.
Instead of that, another prohibited article to offend or defame the Mahomet prophet or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what is an offence nor how it must be punished.
Quite as doubtful is the formulation implying that it is interdict “to offend the people”.
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke to the detriment of a man of law?
Many points are thus matter with interpretation in the project that Morsi submits to the vote and who, according to its own words, will be “very soon” the object of a referendum near the Egyptians.
“The revolution reappears”
The opposition is mobilized since weeks against the digital superiority of the islamist ones.
Friday evening, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual harmony on the Tahrir place in Cairo, promising to make fall the charia before it comes into effect.
“The revolution reappears and we will gain”, launches Hamdin Sabbahi, arrived third at the presidential elections.
The Nobel Prize of the peace and ex-chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei declared that the constitution project is “to throw in the dustbins of the history”.
On Twitter, the instant message service, it showed the partisans of Morsi to want to foment a “putsch against the democracy”.
“If he proclaims the referendum, one will go to his palate and one will reverse it”, exclaims To gossip Said, an opponent.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not expiated yet”, declared according to the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition.
Moreover, several judges announced not to want to supervise the referendum, which would involve its nullity.
“The Koran is our Constitution”
On her side, the Moslem brotherhood, organized well, called with a counter-demonstration not on the Tahrir place by measure of precaution, but on other bank of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the university of Cairo.
The buckled women and the partisans of the Salafists, which took part in it in great number, stressed: “the people claim the application of the law of God.”
“Our country Cleans! ”, they asked Morsi, by affirming that “the Koran [was them] Constitution”.
A combat for sovereignty on the symbolic system places Tharir, where all started, would well quickly have generated a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, it is what the partisans of Morsi wanted to avoid.
The Muslim brothers declared that the opponents with the constitution project, as well as its partisans, had expressed themselves high and strong.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballot boxes of the direction which the country must take.
The project of islamist will gain certainly the majority.
“The human rights are not mentioned only once”
Hafez Abu Saeda is in anger against this imposed constitutional process which should have been prolonged until February and include all the social forces.
This lawyer of the human rights of 48 years and president of the Egyptian Organization of human rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or in front of the courts under Mubarak.
It did it not because it shared their design of the world, but because for him the human rights are indivisible.
This is why it was coiled blows, was considered and imprisoned.
“And now, the term is not even marked once in the new Constitution”, he regrets during his discussion with Welt amndt Sonntag.
The extension of the powers of Morsi to the three powers discouraged lawyer.
These measurements are attacks shouting with the rules of the democracy and they will generate a new dictatorship in Egypt.
“Instead of reinforcing the civil society, the president removes all his powers de facto to him”, Saeda regrets.
However, a democracy cannot function without organizations of the civil society.
Saeda feels forsaken, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the various political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could be paid.
A demonstrator on the Tharir place warns: “you are confined of a monster that it will not be possible any more for you to control.”
The rakfisk of Norway: is it the most odorous fish of the world?
The five million people who populate Norway profits from one of the more high levels of life, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secrecy of the success of the country be related to the appetite of the buildings for an extremely odorous fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty clothing of football.
Wait one week.
And you obtain the disturbing odor of the rakfisk, one of the most snuffed mets of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, at approximately 3 hours of Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this odor, omnipresent, impregnates the air.
The rakfisk is composed of trout powdered with salt and fermented in water for one length of time - according to the odor which you want that it exhales - which can go up to one year.
When the darkness settles and that the weather is cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival which takes place here, in Fagernes, devoted to this incredible culinary speciality.
“You eat raw, then you swallow glass of aquavit”, explains Havard Halvarsen, full-time local fireman whom one also calls “General Rakfisk”, responsible for the management of the festival.
Around us, people avalent of small pieces of fish and thread a great quantity of drink.
“Certain people prefer the aquavit with the rakfisk”, Havard adds.
The drink kills the odor.
I test a few pieces.
If you can avoid making it pass under your nose, it bad - that is not done to think of a sushi which would have spent long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk goes back to one time when Norway was poor, before the invention of the refrigeration, the fish was immersed in water barrels tight with the air, then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once fermented well, the fish left and - without any doubt with the directions reduced by alcohol - ate.
With the former generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, emigrating mainly towards the United States.
Now, the population develops quickly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the full employment, the high wages and a complete health care system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was it does not have so a long time richer there than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is regarded as something of important, a vital element, although odorous, past of Norway.
That made party of the most expensive dishes.
But all is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each one.
Norway often does not make speak about it in the international topicalities, which is not to displease to him.
Here, people are not laid out with speaking about Anders Breivik, the racist extremist of right-hand side which killed 77 people, among which women and children.
When they evoke this slaughter, they speak about “the incident of July 22nd”.
The Norwegians have evil to accept that in their peaceful country, one as of theirs could make such a barbarous act.
Since the beginning as of the Seventies, Norway owes its wealth with its oil industry and gas, one of most important in the world.
“But oil is not the single reason which justifies our success”, explains Anna, our waitress, with blond hair and the eyes of a transpiercing blue, the image of the Scandinavian wellness, with a plate of rakfisk to the hand.
We are - how known as-you - careful people.
Its English, as that of the majority of people who live here, is perfect.
We are discrete, we do not like to point out to us.
Norway managed its oil wealth with much prudence - all, except for a small percentage of money resulting from this industry, is invested in funds special with the profit of the future generations.
When other countries threw money down the drain, during years which led us to the international financial crisis, Norway knew to keep the quite tight cords of its purse.
“As long as one can ski in winter and make excursion in summer, we are happy”, Anna specifies.
“Without forgetting the rakfisk”, she adds in a carefree laughter.
I am held upright under snow and I make the tail to buy what to eat - I had my amount of rakfisk.
With the menu, a hamburger made up of dash, a true discovery, it is excellent.
But this evening, the odor of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I remain is one of the many places where one serves as the rakfisk to dine and where one can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for most odorous of them.
There is an emission of TV where the presenter carries a node-butterfly, surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
One would believe oneself in the competition of Eurovision.
“Which score you did give to best fish, in the Thor-Juergen mountains?”
“Here our points, Havard.”
One hears laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse aquavit.
Or perhaps it is because of fish emanations.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto knows a difficult departure.
Whereas entering President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take up his post in Mexico, Will Grant, of the BBC, is interested in the difficulties which expect it and the expectations of the people, which are numerous.
The road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present.
In a city where the congestions are legion in normal weather, a stopping of security has been set up for Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing a real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the objective was not to prevent the people going to their work, but from preventing the demonstrators from reaching the Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president in charge of the nation.
A complicated task expects it.
The economy of Mexico goes well, of the results which one owes with outgoing president Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a war of the drug which already costed the life of approximately 60.000 people in six years.
“My government undertook towards the Mexican people to reduce violence”, Mr. Pena Nieto with US president Barack Obama in the Oval office declared a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new strategy as regards security which will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before mixing with the US president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populated and tentacular state which encloses the capital. On its ground of predilection, the opinions concerning this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic commune of Valle LED Cheer, for example, it is registered in the memory of all.
The buildings allot to him the development of tourism and the infrastructures in the commune.
To join the city, you can take one of the new motorways of Mr. Pena Nieto, an important improvement was brought to these roads, formerly embossed and full with cracks.
Plates raising its name are hung outside a new sports complex and of an impressive interactive museum dedicated to the climate change.
“We count on him to set up lasting changes”, declared his/her friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and party of Mr. Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for a true change which our country needs so much.
After 81 years without fault with the power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of the congress Olvera admits that after 12 last years apart from the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many waitings within the party concerning Enrique Pena Nieto.
It rejects criticisms of the opponents who reproach the new president for missing charisma.
It is a whole man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
It is an excellent statesman and, over all, it can listen.
However, it is not always the image which people of their former governor have.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known under the name of Ciudad Neza, contrast with the paved streets of Valle LED Cheer could not be more obvious.
Hidden under the overpasses of the motorways, it constitutes, with many regards, suburbs of the town of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the soldiers were called with the rescue to fight against the gangs of drug which prevail in the districts, and the violences made to the women are particularly serious there.
In a disaster area, one found, in edge of discharge, the bodies of tens of women assassinated during two last years.
More than 1.000 women were killed in the state of Mexico whereas Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a rate much higher than in the very violent town of Ciudad Juarez - a place sadly celebrates for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
The detractors of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, it did not succeed in damming up the problem of the murders perpetrated against the women when it was in function.
In the worst case, they show its administration to refuse to see reality opposite.
In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated district, Irinea Buendia fights to retain its tears when it shows me photographs of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version mentions a suicide made by Mariana in 2010.
However, its family thinks that it was killed by her partner.
“When I arrived to it, it seemed to me that its body had been washed”, Señora Buendia tells.
Signs indicated that it had been beaten, and the rigor mortis was already started.
Whereas his/her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana equips the wall, beside a cross where figure the word: Justice.
However, it is exactly what the family saw itself refusing.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old gossip, a fautrice of disorder, a crybaby.
They want that one accepts what they say and which one keep silent.
“But it is not normal that there are as many irregularities and omissions”, she declared.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf Saturday, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families were touched by the crime in Mexico during six last years and the new president made the promise that it would make his priority of it during his mandate.
“I hope that it will be as good as a president as when he was governor”, Olvera declared, in Valle LED Cheer, member of the Congress.
However, it is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear more.
Bradley Manning did not complain ill-treatments, declare the prosecutors.
The prosecutors try to counter the claims of ill-treatment whose Bradley Manning would have been victim at the time of detention.
The lawsuit relates to the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, to Virginia.
Defense wants to classify the business with the reason that the sequestration of Manning was done under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is shown to have concealed thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to show, Friday, that the soldier Bradley Manning -- shown to be at the origin of the largest escape of confidential information of all the history of the American army -- missed many occasions to complain about the ill-treatments which he claims to have undergone at the time of his military detention.
At the time of a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary audience with Ft. Meade, Maryland, the Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein affirmed that weekly recordings of visits paid to Manning by officers during its nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not reveal any complaint concerning its treatment.
The cross-examination -- during an audience, defense presented a request requiring that the business Manning be classified with the reason which sequestration was made under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified his desire for committing suicide during his detention.
This analyst of the military information, decree in June 2010, is shown to have concealed thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning had been their source.
At the time of the audience of Friday, Fein examined with Manning the forms which the officers had filled after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison of Quantico, where it was subjected to a maximum prison insulation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers put questions to Manning and consigned his answers.
When Fein evoked the forms, Friday, Manning recognized that the treatment that booked its guards to him was “excellent” and that the treatment which it had had within the prison was overall “very professional.”
The forms do not mention any complaint for ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned it about its prison treatment, affirmed Fein.
Manning answered that it had orally expressed concerns relating to certain problems and that the officers in visit had discussed its concerns and had indicated that they would be occupied some, but they did not consign the mentioned problems.
“They wrote “any problem” (after having approached concerns), and for as much, that did not mean that I had not raised issues”, Manning declared.
The military judge Collar. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during a discussion in January 2011 with the special subcommittee which had met to evoke the suicidal thoughts that he had expressed in writing a few months before.
Manning answered that its intention during the meeting was to make amend its restrictive indicating a “risk of wound”.
The soldiers declared that they had assigned this restrictive statute to him -- a level below the monitoring brought closer for risk to suicide -- for its protection and the security of the others.
“I wanted that staff knows that I was well, and I wanted that one withdraws me this statute… in order to profit from a better quality of life from my point of view”, Manning declared.
Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and of his transfer to Kuwait, where it was held during nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison from the base from the Body from the Marines with Quantico, in Virginia, in July 2010.
He stated to have planned to commit suicide when he was to Kuwait and to be themselves disappeared once because of heat.
He added that the fact of not being held with the current of what he was going to arrive to him or from what occurred in the rest of the world was very distressing.
“My world was tiny room to Arafjon Camp, with this cage”, Manning declared, Thursday.
I thought that I was going to die in this cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning declared that it had spent most clearly his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects of which it laid out were a mattress, a cover, flip-flops, clothing and its glasses.
It tried to remain moving, because to sleep or remain lengthened during the day was contrary with the regulation.
Manning also specified that when it tried to sleep, it had a light in the eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see its face when it was turned over the night, they awoke it in order to be able to see its face.
The lawyer of Manning deposited a formal complaint for the treatments undergone by Manning in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison with Strong Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Friday also, the judge put questions to Manning concerning an allegation reported in his testimony of Thursday -- that after forcebeing forced to sleep naked a whole night in his cell with Quantico, one forced it to be held naked in front of the guards and other prisoners one morning, during the call.
Manning testified that at any moment, it was allowed to him to be covered with a cover during the call.
During the questions of the judge, Friday, Manning declared that he had deduced about his guard that he was to release his cover which could have hidden its nudity, but he recognized that nobody had ordered to him to release it.
Manning testified Thursday that it had been forced to sleep naked the night before, because it would have tried to prove to an officer who he was not a danger to itself.
Manning would have declared with the officer that it could have used the rubber band of his slipway or its flip-flops to be wounded, but that it had not done it.
This night, Manning testified that its underwear, its flip-flops, and its glasses had been withdrawn from its cell.
Its lawyers hope that at least the judge will take account of the experiments that it lived during his detention and that it will reduce his sentence considerably if he were to be recognized guilty before a court-martial, a lawsuit which should be held at the beginning of next year.
Defense declared that Manning plans to plead guilty the least serious offences and to fight for the abandonment of other loads considered to be too extreme.
The audience should take again this weekend, with prosecutors who should assert that the detention conditions were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was imprisoned in accordance with the regulation which governs the detention conditions of all the prisoners with Quantico.
The counts of indictment carried against Manning include the flight of goods or public documents, the collusion with the enemy, causing the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of relative information to national defense.
If all the counts of indictment are retained, it incurs the life imprisonment.
My Mexico City-American identity crisis
He says that many was forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities
The Mexicans tend to blame those which left; they recall the Mexicans the difficult periods, he declared.
Navarrette says that Mexico City-American finds itself taken between two worlds.
At the time of a recent travel to Mexico City, while arriving in the hall, owe the immigration and customs authorities, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two ways: for the “Mexicanos” (“Mexican”), another for the “Extranjeros” (“Foreign”).
I remained motionless during several seconds, not knowing towards which file to direct me.
I grew in the center of California, where me was called the “Mexican” all my life.
It is about an ethnic qualifier, as well as that which my friends of Boston use when they are said “Irish”, or my friends of New York when they are said “Italian”.
Then, I became “Mexico City-American”.
But, here, it was Mexico.
And, on the ground which saw being born my grandfather, no need for special qualifier nor of hyphen.
I was simply an American.
I speak Spanish, to manage sufficiently well a maintenance in one or the other language.
But I do not have the vocabulary of indigenous, and I cannot lose my American accent.
Then I took my American passport and I moved towards the file “Foreigners”.
I thought of this moment of the week when new Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama, in the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their topics of predilection are immigration, drug and the trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to speak about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons which push the Mexicans to remain in Mexico rather than to risk itself in the United States.
It wishes to be combined in the United States and Canada, and to create a Union for the trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto commits itself continuing the war against the cartels of drug in Mexico, although it did not provide more details.
For Mexico, the relation with the United States complicated and is filled of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to yield in writing half of their territory to the forefront of rifle.
But for the Mexicans, who reflect in terms of centuries, and not of minutes, the memories are everywhere.
Consequently, as soon as official U.S. formulates the least critic with regard to Mexico, you start to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints on the way in which the Americans undermine the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma seek the brawl.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relation is that which the country maintains with the most 35 million Mexico City-Americans who live in the United States.
Do you want that the subject of the bitterness is broached?
There is much of it.
Mexico has its winners and its losers, of the people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for which the country does not offer any.
The only reason which explains a large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at a given time, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a relative or a grandparent, did not find any opportunity in Mexico and had to go in North.
And generally, this person corresponded to a standard profile -- a sunk skin, little informed, resulting from a poor village, etc
We are their descendants, and we are honest towards them.
Pas le Mexique.
And even if we currently live dreamed American, that we in good schools and that we have good situations, we went do not have to never lose sight of the fact that it is dreamed American that we live, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our honesty is obvious.
We grant it to the United States.
In addition, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not love us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We point out a humiliating defeat to them and they measure us as if we were individuals of stock lower and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will be never rather good, our bonds with Mexico will be never rather strong.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves not wedged a good side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost hearts.
My woman which was born in Guadalajara and which emigrated legally in the United States whereas it was child, recalls me that there exist frictions between the Mexicans and the Mexico City-Americans, because the Mexicans more firmly assert their identity and the Mexico City-Americans are opposed by it.
Although it is American citizen, it has the feeling to belong to two countries.
In addition, many Mexico City-Americans whom I know do not have the feeling to belong to a country or other.
We adore the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigers del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of the two worlds, but we are rooted in none of both.
In Mexico, one regards us as Americans.
And in the United States, one regards us as Mexicans.
And now, to complicate a little more the relation, as I learned during my stay, certain Mexican leaders and part of intelligentsia want to approach the Diaspora.
They want that the Mexico City-Americans work as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, by representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country which it is absolutely necessary to visit and put the pressure to the political leaders to reinforce the bonds with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That will not arrive.
There is too much bitterness.
And, if one considers the inequalities of wages, the corruption and the violence related to drug which are omnipresent, much among us are not persuaded that it is about a fantastic country.
You will have to only clear up you, amigos.
It is normal.
So certain Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States in the way in which they treated Mexico there are one century and half, they must consequently accept that certain Mexico City-Americans are upset with them always way in which the members of their family were treated it does not have there so a long time.
Hmmm.
Perhaps let us be us more “Mexican” that I did not think it.
Old quarrels, the new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas are still a failure for peace.
Won't it be able to never have there a durable peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is vain.
While persist in the same futile arguments to know which started, of tens of buildings were reduced in dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most between them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, of the launched rockets of Gaza landed close to Tel-Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the Holy City of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem blocked in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full change.
Arab spring did everything to fly in glares, and that it or not is wanted, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up with by this regional upheaval.
Perhaps that their fight will intensify still a little more.
However, there are all the reasons to think that could help them to leave this dead end mortal.
A war which makes to no loser nor any winner
At first sight, it seems difficult to show optimism.
Even if the cease-fire granted on November 21st is maintained, the combat of this week reinforced the partisans of the force, on the two sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the islamist movement which directs Gaza since 2007, will pride themselves to have forced the Israelis to give up, even if Gaza wiped a beating.
To have killed some of its leaders and to have driven back the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and over-populated corners of planet, Israel did not succeed in destroying Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas gains ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently to the hands of their rivals of Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas could think that time is their ally.
The influence of islamist of the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas was made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a regional power in full rise, formerly the Moslem ally nearest to Israel, took makes and causes for Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the richest states and most dynamic of the Golf.
The members of Hamas are jubilant and say that the Islamist crescent is curved around Israel, from Lebanon, in north, where the militia of the Hezbollah exerts her domination, via Syria, where the rebels with islamist trend can reverse Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where the allies of Hamas threaten the king.
And most important, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim brothers with in the chair the Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far more populated and most central of the Arab countries, changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, this despot who controlled Egypt during 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim brothers are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders rely more easily on the public opinion.
In the future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an actor of importance which could not be excluded any more even by Israel and America.
During this time, the partisans of the hard line of Israel will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was given out of box.
The system of interception of missiles baptized Iron Dome proved its effectiveness and of many missiles of Hamas were destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their two ears - during a certain time.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and of many European countries reproached Hamas for being at the origin of the last wave of violence.
But especially, Israel thrived, in particular under Binyamin Netanyahu, the first-minister, who completely was unaware of the peace process.
Although rocket fires of Gaza killed approximately 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel was saved by the attacks suicides, in particular thanks to the barrier of separation which encroaches on the West Bank, the principal piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects the Jewish colonies which continue to extend in spite of their illegality as regards international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party amalgamated with a party even more warmonger, that of the leader Avigdor Lieberman to the approach of the election of January 22nd, has the beautiful part.
Why pamper these rotten Palestinian in their giving a state?
If they directed the West Bank, wouldn't they launch of the rockets, as their compatriots did it in Gaza?
It is preferable to keep them behind this wall and to strike them as soon as they leave the head.
Perhaps that the partisans of the line lasts will carry it; but it may be that Arab spring changes gives it.
Even if the islamist ones which takes the power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate Israel little, their priority will be to attack the problems in their own countries.
The defence budget of Israel is more important than that of its four brought together Arab neighbors.
To begin a war with the local super power will not help the new Arab governments to arrange their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to obtain a cease-fire what is of good omen -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think in the future.
With the Arab rest of the world which becomes more democratic, to deprive the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create an explosives magazine which is dedicated to explode one day in the occupied territories by Israel - a little like the bus which exploded in Tel-Aviv this week.
Repression weakens already the democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza all both or three years to sound Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic level.
The two sides need to be thorough by those of outside.
The answer remains that preached by the reasonable people whom one finds on each side, and by most external world and this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in return for the security.
A hope, small and short-term, is that the cease-fire will give the opportunity to the external people to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now harness itself to put an end to the circulation of weapons towards Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is placed better than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the borders of 1967 with exchanges of shared ground and a Jerusalem.
The Arabs of the external countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah so that they are linked.
That would contribute much more to creation of a Palestinian state that the nearest proposal for a pseudonym state with UNO.
Mr. Obama also has any interest so that Israel agrees to negotiate.
During its first mandate, it did not present its own peace plan.
Of return to the White House, it seems quite as reticent to establish one of them.
It is a very skimped vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital challenge for America.
That makes by a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for neutral cigarette packs are comings into effect in Australia
Warnings and sick photographs of bodies recover the green packages dark which all are identical, whatever the brand
This law coming into effect in Australia is first world, the logos and the colors were replaced by a dark green olive and horrible photographs of sick bodies and representations of children and babies whose diseases were caused by the tobacco addiction of their parents.
Apart from the various photographs and medical warnings, the only difference between the packages, for this Saturday, has been the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all the packages.
It is the most strict mode in the world as regards packing of tobacco.
The Australian federal government declared that the objective was to dissuade the young people to smoke by removing any representation glamour.
Studies showed that if the people did not start to smoke before the 26 years age, there is 99% of chances that they never start.
“Even when they are very young, the children understand the message conveyed by the manufacturers of tobacco through their brand image”, the Federal Minister for health declared, Tanya Plibersek, by quoting studies which revealed for example that the children associated the crown of a logo to a princess.”
Even if Australia records more the low level of tobacco addiction in the world and if these changes have only little impact on the benefit of the multinationals, other countries consider a similar approach.
The tobacco industry put pressure against this law.
The manufacturers of tobacco declared that would start again the trade of the black-market, which will more easily give access to less expensive cigarettes.
“Fatal consequences will rise from this legislation”, Scott McIntyre declared, of British American Tobacco Australia.
The forgers of China and Indonesia will sell much more cigarettes of counterfeit in the streets of Australia.
Others declared that this law had instigated their activity.
Sandra Ha de Zico Importation Pty Ltd, a family small company, declared that the request for cases with cigarettes, in particular out of silicone to mask horrible packing, strongly increased two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain' S Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco disputed the law and lost before the high court of Australia.
Ha declared that Zico sold 6.000 of them to wholesalers and is on standby of renewal of stock.
For us, the business is good.
The only trouble, say the experts, is the popularity of the social media and the slice of population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting the advertisements with the TV, sporting sponsoring and the obligation for the dealers to dissimulate the cigarettes, the marketing of the tobacco is now available online.
Australia prohibited publicity on the Web by the local companies and sites, but it cannot prevent the foreign sites from making some.
“If you work in the marketing of the tobacco and that you do not lay out any more that of a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the place impossible to circumvent par excellence”, declared Becky Freeman, enquiring in public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noticed an increase in the contributions of certain average citizens in favour as of brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Do we have to wonder whether it is about an ordinary citizen who adores the Marlboro cigarettes and which tried hard to make a video, or if it is about a campaign marketing orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia declared that industry concentrates on the new regulation into force rather than on marketing.
Industry went until paying the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to dispute these new legal decisions - these countries declared with WHO that the trade is wrongfully handicapped, although none of these countries had important commercial exchanges with Australia.
A decision of WTO should be taken during the course of the year 2013.
Plibersek declared that the government had held of the discussions with other countries concerning of the similar laws on packing.
Canada was the first country to make compulsory the photographs of warning on packing in 2001.
Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, of which Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More severe laws are currently under investigation in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photographs.
The photographs do not disturb me.
I am unaware of them.
“You take a cigarette and you arrange the package”, declared Victor El Hage at the time to buy a package on which figure a photograph of tumour of the mouth.
To be frank, the only reason which will make me stop, it is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the “King of the Pack tobacconist” in the center of Sydney, declared that the uniformity of packing made difficult the storage of the packages on the displays.
“Front, it took me one hour to discharge a parcel, now, it takes me four hours” declared Yu.
“The government had only once and for all to prohibit them and we would have said OK, they are good, one stops and one puts the key under the door”, he added, while raising the arms with the sky.
In a world constantly connected, it can be good to be bored.
I spent five hours in an airport for the period of Thanksgiving, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to expect the arrival of another plane.
Consequently, I had sufficient time to think of the topic of the trouble.
I will not lie you.
To spend one half-day in an airport to expect a flight is rather tedious, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (without forgetting the shops of duty-free).
But more and more, certain academics and experts specialized in the development of the child speak in praise of the trouble.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to be bored from time to time, they say.
That forces the brain to take interesting ways, to even nourish the creativity.
And as we are, for the majority, constantly in front of several types of screens, we do not know any more the benefits of the trouble.
Then should we accommodate the trouble with open arms?
Yes.
And not.
But I will return there.
First of all, following the example of much of people, I thought that the trouble was a rather recent phenomenon, in particular since we have more free time.
But it is not the case, declares Peter Toohey, professor of history gréco-Roman at the University of Calgary, with Canada, and author of “Boredom: In Lively History” (Yale University Press, 2011).
“The trouble goes back to very far”, he says.
On the walls of Pompéi are reproduced of the Latin graffiti which evoke the trouble, they go back to the first century.
Then, there is the definition which we give to the trouble.
The problem is that it was defined, and discussed, in various ways, declared John D. Eastwood, qualified schoolteacher of psychology in York University in Ontario, Canada.
After having traversed many publications and subjected the idea to a newsgroup of approximately 100 people, Professeur Eastwood and his colleagues defined the trouble as being an experiment which consists in “wanting to do something, but without managing to launch out in a satisfactory activity.”
What differentiates the trouble from apathy, he says, it is that the person is not undertaking a task although she would wish it.
With apathy, he says, it does not want there to do something.
What is in the middle of the trouble, he declared, it is “the interruption of the process of attention, associated with a gloomy mood and the feeling which time passes slowly.”
The trouble can strongly resemble a depression.
But Professeur Eastwood declared that if both can be dependent, the people who are bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while the depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes, it sometimes happens to us to think that we are bored whereas it acts by way of a problem of concentration.
Within the framework of their study, “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention”, which was published in the newspaper “Prospects one Psychological Science” in September, Professeur Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an older experiment in which the participants listened on cassette, the voice of a person reading an article of magazine.
Certain groups heard, coming from the room at side, the too high sound of an emission of TV which did not have any report, others just heard the emission of TV, and the third group did not hear at all bandage it.
Those which heard the TV on a low noise level said that they had been bored more than the two other groups - they had evil to concentrate, but did not know why, and allotted this problem of concentration to the trouble.
When you try to concentrate you on a difficult or fascinating task, an interruption of the attention can lead to the trouble, declared Mark J. Fenske, a qualified schoolteacher of neuroscience in University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you carry out a tedious task, “like looking at objects on an assembly line, the music can help you not to annoy you.”
In fact, he says, now, we know that when one twists oneself or that one scribbles, these gestures, often considered as signs of trouble, are in fact a good means of remaining physically more alert.
“Studies showed that the children who are authorized to wriggle learn more and retain more information than those which are forced to remain without moving”, Professeur Fenske declared.
We are bored a whole day or the other - the delay of my flight of plane, a speaker with a monotonous voice, a particularly tedious film.
But certain people are more likely to be bored than others.
To measure that, of the researchers developed a “Scale of predisposition to the trouble” in the Eighties.
The scale includes assertions like, “Among the tasks which I carry out, much of them are repetitive and monotonous”, and “I have centers of interest so much that I do not have time to do everything.”
By using such a scale, the researchers discovered that the boys tend to be bored more often than the girls, declared Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology in University of West Florida, and need in particular many and varied stimulations.
But in general, the teenagers are quickly blasé.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor under development individual and Community in University of Illinois, undertook an experiment during which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times per day via one to beep.
It raised that 32 percent of the teenagers stated to be bored at the school and during their duties at the house, while 23 percent stated to be bored when they were not at the school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents stated to be bored.
Professor Larson declared that it did not know if the percentages of trouble of today, is 21 years later, would be raised or lower.
But he added that he knew that “adolescence is one period when the trouble reaches its more high level”, in particular because the children and the teenagers do not have much control on what they want to do.
If I rest my question: is the trouble good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, that can involve the people to take absurd physical chances, to make bets or to misuse certain substances to spend the time, as the studies show it.
On the other hand, of many philosophers and writers evoke a bond between the trouble and the creativity, declared the Professeur Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
“The trouble is the means which the brain found to state to you that you should make another thing”, declared Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology to the N.Y.U.
But the brain always does not know which is the thing most adapted to make.
If you are bored and that you use this energy to play of the guitar and to cook, that will return to you happy.
But if you look at the TV, that will return to you happy in the short run, but not in the long run.
Then if your child is bored and that you give him a iPad, it will not be bored any more, but it will not have learned how to be occupied all alone nor with autorégler, declares professor Fenske.
And “this autorèglement passes from a situation to another”, he declares.
Your child does not only learn how to divert himself, it obtains more control of itself in other fields.
I do not think that we should glorify the trouble.
Just like I do not think either that we should criticize it.
To feel at ease apart from the constant boiling that generate the activities and technology is the objective towards which should tend to us.
Professor Eastwood is of agreement on this point.
“We need to more often annoy us, but the trouble wakes up an acute and frantic desire to be connected to something which has direction”, he declared.
According to him, which people search, it is a means of disconnecting and of appreciating the downtimes.
“In an environment where we constantly are hyperstimulés”, he added, “it is difficult to find ways of launching out in something when the noise stops.”
In Colorado, any directive for the new law on the marijuana
Anthony Orozco, 19 years, studying in a university and football player in Colorado, is accused for something which will become soon legal in its state: possession of pellets of marijuana and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco declared that one day, in September, him and some friends were on board a Lamar car, in the middle of the fields, close to the border with Kansas, when they were stopped.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a quotation to appear for drug possession and equipment which can be used with his consumption - minor offences, each one being accompanied by a fine of 100 $ - and a date as appearance.
“We are treated like criminals”, Mr. Orozco declared.
But is it one?
During the weeks of uncertainty which followed the vote of Colorado to legalize the consumption of modest amounts of marijuana for its personal use, the answer given to hundreds of business implying a weak use of drugs depends more of the place than of the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offences implying the use of marijuana were classified without continuation.
The police services ceased accusing of the 21 year old adults and more minor possession of marijuana, because the law will into effect come the weeks to come.
But the prosecutors who are in the more preserving districts of Colorado invited to accelerate the business of existing marijuana and continue to accuse the people who have some.
In parallel, several cities of the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West currently vote to prevent the opening of trade of sale of marijuana approved by the State in their districts.
“The things evolve so quickly that I know what the future books to us”, Daniel J. Oates, the chief of the police of Aurora declared, east of Denver.
The organizations of regulation of the State of Washington have also not bad doubts.
They are in search of directives on the way of installing a system of licence, authorizing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1st, 2013.
They say that Colorado, that it or not is wanted, is in advance on most states as regards regulation on the marijuana, first of all concerning the use with the fine therapeutic ones and maintaining with regard to the personal use.
“Colorado has a market more regulated, and constitutes a good indicator”, declared Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place nor system, recognizes Mr. Smith, cannot make more than suggest what functions.
“There is not a real precedent on which we could base ourselves, he said.
The law of Washington, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6th, which leaves one year a gap in the law, during which the system of licence will still not exist, whereas the possession of marijuana is legal.
During this time, practical matters remain outstanding: how to balance the mandate of the state which guarantees an access appropriate to the approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of trade of sale of cannabis in a radius of 30 km around a school, a park, a playing field or a crib.
“It will not take place there more difficult than urban areas to install an approved trade of sale of cannabis, in particular in the metropolitan zone of Seattle”, Ben Livingston, a spokesperson of the Center of legalization of the cannabis declared, a group of research recently formed.
On November 21st, the chief of the police, Oates, in Aurora, sent e-mail to his officers announcing that the “City attorney” (representative of the Public Ministry) would not continue any more people the 21 year old and more which has modest amounts of marijuana, and which the police was to cease accusing of the people for this kind of offence “for immediate purpose.”
The Chief Oates declared that the police would apply the new legal decisions which regulate the activity of those which cultivate the marijuana at medical ends, and which it would continue to continue the drug traffickers and the dealers.
In Weld County, in the north of Colorado, the “district attorney” (Public prosecutor), Ken Buck, incarnates a more strict vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with the business of possession of marijuana, mainly in order to put pressure on the users so that they are made detoxicate.
At present, 119 people are accused of possession of 56 grams or less marijuana, but much of them are the object of other inculpations.
“Our office has the obligation to bring continuations against these people who made an offence which, at the time as of facts, was a recognized infringement”, Mr. Buck declared.
The reactions were complicated even in rural places like Mesa County, where the voters rejected the initiative in favour of the restricted consumption of marijuana.
The police with Large Junction, more the big city of the county, does not make any more appear of adults for possession of restricted quantities.
The representative of the Public Ministry of the county, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to classify without continuation all the business of detention of marijuana.
“I do not have the impression to waste my time to continue to apply the law until it changes”, he declared.
Although 55 per hundred of the voters of Colorado supported measurement, to offer a legal framework and governmental appropriate to the personal consumption of marijuana is not easy matter to achieve.
And the contradictory reactions which were observed in various American cities highlight deep ambivalence among the official buildings with regard to the legalization of the marijuana.
“It is about a cultural barrier” with the representatives of the Public Ministry, declared Sean McAllister, a lawyer of Denver which represents the marked people of consumption of marijuana and which is expressed as a local spokesperson of the “National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws” (National organization for the reform of the laws on the marijuana).
“They passed a good part of their life to be prosecuted of the people who consumed marijuana, as, they have evil to accept as it is legal”, he declared.
As first states to treat the restricted consumption of marijuana with the same level as that of alcohol, the Colorado and the state of Washington are about to becoming a case of jurisprudence for the legalization of drugs.
Whereas the defenders and of the representatives of the State envisage a new border of legalized sales, they expect with concern the directives of the federal government, which always conceives the sale and the culture of marijuana like federal crimes.
The defenders of the legalization of the marijuana hope that the Ministry for Justice will yield.
In spite of certain popularized through the media arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and salesmen, the federal government especially allowed the trade of sale of marijuana to the fine therapeutic ones to exert in Colorado, in Washington and in 16 other states.
If it is true that the police probably will not insert the doors to seize small sachets of drugs, there is extremely to bet that she is opposed to the approved trade of sale of marijuana with personal use authorized by the new laws, declared Kevin A. Sabet, a former political advisor of the administration Obama.
Many cities of Colorado did not wait until the federal authorities act.
Well before the votes, certain local governments approved moratoriums concerning the creation of the new trade of sale of marijuana, even if it is only about one carryforward one year.
Last week, the town of Montrose obtained a 6 months moratorium, and should impose this prohibition the next week.
“We do not want to find us in a situation where a licence is granted to somebody and then to find us confronted with a federal problem”, declared Bob Nicholson, a member of the town council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than to the vote of the State.
Many questions are posed.
Petronella Wyatt: I was abused and excluded from Oxford, because I was a “Tory” (preserving).
They are not only the students of today who are attacked for their opinions.
Also far I remember, I always dreamed to enter to the University of Oxford.
My father and my older brother studied in what was for me an eminent place to know, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times which stimulates the two pillars of the civilisation, the freethinking and the tolerance.
However, two weeks after me to be installed in Worcester College at the end of the Eighties to study the history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father crumbled and started to cry.
My friends were disconcerted.
The newspaper of Standard Evening claimed that I had left this university, because I had objected the fact that students of the first cycle had sexual relationships in the room beside the mienne.
Author A. NR. Wilson declared with joke that I had left after being forced to drink in notched cups.
The truth was less funny.
I fled.
Yes, I fled, because I had been victim of intimidations and is the object of constant victimizations.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, nor because of fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for only one and single reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowledge, I was victim of a racist and barbarian behavior: my regretted father, Woodrow Wyatt, one was advised very influential of Margaret Thatcher and I was well-wisher of the Conservative party.
Why evoke that today, you will tell me.
And well, of the recent studies revealed that a new generation of students of centre-droite undergoes the same type of persecution.
Increasing and institutionalized hatred students Tory in Oxford east such as last week, some of them required a protection of their rights, as well as those of the gays, the handicapped people and the ethnic minorities.
The preserving members of the room of students (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College declared that they “were often insulated, attacked personally and felt undesirable” because of their political opinions.
They want that there is a representative within the Committee of the university for the equal opportunity so that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary one diffused on BBC Two “Wonderland: Young, Bright and one the Right” (“country of the wonders: Young people, Intelligent and of Right-hand side”), devoted to the policy in the students, and which depicted the “Tories” like eccentrics and the neo-Nazi ones.
One discovered there in particular the student Joe Cooke, former president of “Conservative Oxford University Association (OUCA)”, which moves in Rolls-Royce, raises complete silver plated and moves with a cane with chrome head.
In other universities, the preserving students say being treated like scapegoats of the installation of the increase in the school fees.”
Luke Black, 20 years, vice-president of “Conservative Nottingham University Association”, declared with a Sunday newspaper “that there is a bias of left growing in the universities.
People think that we are like Bullingdon Club without same to have met to us.”
Samuel Roberts, 21 years, studying in history in the Corpus Christi, which proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is “uncomfortable”, and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, president of the OUCA, known as that there was a deterioration of the attitude of the members of the JCR with regard to the people who are of centre-droite.
“That constitutes an obstacle with the freedom of the intellectual debates, like with the wellness of the members”, she declared.
I was the only one to think of the kind during my first past weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, I was then 18 years old and of a paralysing timidity.
The hatred of the conservative party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted the refusal to grant to Margaret Thatcher - old student - an honorary title, because of the reduction of the financing of the higher learning.
The atmosphere was in charge of Stalinist vibrations.
As of the first days of the week of reception, when the new students made knowledge with the others and the professors, I had a first impression what thereafter was going to do without.
I discovered that the professors not only took part in the sarcastic remarks towards the students Tory, but that moreover, they took pleasure there.
It was like if the policy about the minor strikers, of privatization and the opposition of the government to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were engraved in the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcastic remark of which I was victim related to a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared there.
“Miss Wyatt”, professor Harry Pitt said (now deceased), “please translate the first paragraph”
I lost foot.
Pitt, a small man with the pustuleux face, carried himself easily.
“Thatchéristes do refuse to learn French or it is just stupid?” he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears burned me the eyes.
“I you suggest taking French courses during your free time - finally, if you are not too occupied making you friends”, he launched an aggressive tone.
I am turned over in my room, inconsolable.
During dining it there this evening, I am base alone then I felt a light slap on my shoulder.
It was student in second year of English studies, named James, who was presented in the form of a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are”, he said, nicely.
I am afraid well that it is thus.
Any person suspected of being a Tory (preserving) is taken for target.
It is hard already enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, that will be thus even harder for you.
Most young Tories claim to be Ploughing (members of the Labour Party).
Later, with the local pub, I loosely tried to hide me.
I insisted on the fact that I was not agreement with all that Mrs. Thatcher had said.
This stratagem failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political sciences and economic which, ironically, had studied in Eton, said: “You are the girl of a fascistic pig.”
You are contaminated.
Other students took again the refrain.
I was perverted, dirty.
“How Tories make love?” asked one of them.
They strike the ones the others, isn't this?”
I felt like the homosexual ones before the liberal legislation of the Sixties.
Could I only have led a normal life to Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people sharing the same points of view only after fallen the night?
Should I have become Ploughing and disavow my opinions?
The three years to come were going to resemble a purgatory of ostracism and insulation.
Only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, which taught in my university.
He was hated not only because he was preserving, but also because he was to advise in foreign policy of Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
It was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and unimportant place, like his adhesion from the point of view of Marxist-determinist of the history.
In 1997, it accepted a post of professor at the university of Bilkent, in Ankara, in Turkey.
“You will not be happy here”, it said me.
I started to make the shuttle between Oxford and the house of my parents in London, finding refuge near my family and of my more open town friends of spirit.
I said to my father that I hated Oxford and I explained to him why.
It was incredulous.
During its studies in Oxford, in the Forties, all the political points of view were accepted.
“But it is the best place in the world”, it said me pathetically.
They would not do that, not in the city with the bell-towers dreamers.
Even my communist friends had irreproachable manners.
It had the tears with the eyes.
Leave them a chance.
I am sure that is to tease you.
That would break me the heart if you left Oxford.
Tired by my frequent travel to London, my emotional resistance gradually worsened.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to the pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a working session directed the following week, when another professor of history suggested most seriously of the world, that I was “an enemy of the people”, I decided to do as much of it.
Reddening internally of shame, I admitted to be victim of the washing of brain of my parents and treated them of “insane old men”.
The respite was of short time.
It is my father who inserted the last nail of my coffin oxfordien.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the press of Murdoch each week.
My door was locked.
I remained tapie in my room, and after five minutes, my prosecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed my bag and I took the first train for London.
I am never gone back there.
You can treat me softy pleurnicharde.
But no 18 year old child should be victim of such an intimidation in a school.
More tragic is that it was about Oxford, which not only has product 14 Prime Ministers Tory, but also profits from a steadfast reputation from equality and freedom of thought.
“Valentino prefers elegance with notoriety”
Within the framework of the exposure “Valentino: a Master of the Seam”, inaugurated this week in London, ABC questioned Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian dressmaker.
Somerset House, the old residence of Élisabeth Ire of England, is the only place of the worthy British capital to accommodate an exposure on Valentino Garavani.
The dressmaker recognized it during the unveiling of “Valentino: a Master of the Seam”, a prestigious retrospective which joins together more than 130 models of haute couture created for its designers house during 50 last years.
“I adore this palate”, he declared with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exposure is the point of organ of a history whose only protagonist is “it signore” Garavani, but which could not have been written without its famous customers.
Valentino was always fascinated by the closed world and except for nobility.
In the first room of this exposure, open until March 3rd, one finds a number impressing of private letters and photographs signed by the cream of the aristocracy, since the princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, via the princess Marie-Chantal de Grèce and Margaret d'Angleterre.
Valentino exposes its personal memories like the trophies of its social rise: of the modest dressmaker of the town of Voghera, north of Italy, with the idol of the international jet set.
There is nothing evil to like the royalty.
“At least, they do not crush their cigarette ends of cigarettes on your splendid carpet as certain stars of the pop music do it”, the baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza declares.
In the Sixties and Seventies, we lived both in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
“We adored all being invited in its country cottage of Gstaad”, explains the ex-wife of “Heini” Thyssen, intimate friend of beauties of the time spent like Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino always preferred elegance with notoriety.
And even thus, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, carrying a Valentino model
The mannequin Argentina, Valeria Mazza, did not forget the charisma of the dressmaker either.
Several years ago, after a procession on the Place from Spain, in Rome, we went to dine with his apartment.
We were about twenty people, among whom Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
One saw and felt his spirit in each detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, the music.
“With him, each guest felt important and appreciated”, remembers to it “top model”, which started to work with him lasting the week of the High-Seam in Paris in 1995.
“It will never pass from mode, because its creations are works of art”, she finishes.
Procession of line of nobility
The life of Garavani is not a history of obsessions but of loves not shared.
He loves quite high people and with the largest titles and them like it too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House was transformed into a podium sixty meters broad glamour which proposes to exchange the roles: the visitor takes the place of the mannequins and must ravel on the podium to admire a “public” of dreamed creating principal Valentino, as the tailor whom Jackie Kennedy for his marriage with Aristote Onassis had chosen, the costume which Monica Vitti in “Notte carried”, or a coat out of wool and fur having belonged to the empress Farah Diba.
Among this public of mannequins, one finds names like Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norvège, Rosario de Bulgarie or Sophie de Habsbourg.
Naty Abascal and the dressmaker in 2006
Many of its customers say that the first Valentino clothing is like the first love, “impossible to forget”.
I remember some perfectly.
It was of trousers, a shirt, a waistcoat “gillette” and a jacket of the collection autumn-winter 1971-1972.
“It is a present which he had given me”, declared Naty Abascal, one of the Muses of the dressmaker.
“I prefer it with all the others for his femininity, his great love of the women, and because it sublimates our beauty”, the ex-duchess of Fair adds.
I like much the colors that it uses, they am luminous and light the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and modeuse Patricia della Giovampaola d' Arenberg cannot, it either, to forget the first time that it carried a Valentino model.
When it was teenager and lived in Italy, it dreamed to have the age and the opportunity of carrying one of its evening gowns…
Finally, that was possible at the end of the Nineties.
I bought my first model Valentino for a festival in the castle of my cousin, prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red evening gown, with a flounced skirt, a draped long-line bra and a low neckline to fall.
“It one was dreamed become reality”, the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg declared.
“Valentino is indifferent to the mode, it is obsessed by the timeless one”, explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg preserves the evening gowns of the dressmaker with “the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only one dress, it is also the whole of the memories which it conveys”.
The “king” of the mode
The large final one of the exposure of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller carried at the time of his marriage with Paul de Grèce in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 “ragazze” (the dressmaker calls its dressmakers thus) to produce this silk dress ivory with incrustations of pearls, twelve kinds of laces different and a drag from four meters and half.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the haute couture of the end of the 20th century, “the return of the customers of the high society”.
Obnubilated during years by the “knowledge-being” of the nobility, Valentino is now its best representing.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander about Arts and of the Letters, decorated with the Legion with Honor, Garavani cumulates as many honors as any husband of its customers.
“Its refinement, its calm, its neat and perfect aspect always jumped me to the eyes”, recognizes of Arenberg.
The last time that I saw it, it was one month ago with a dinner of official reception to the Museum of Orsay.
He had sat with the table of the countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my large friends.
“It was impeccable, the years do not have any effect on him”.
If it is a princess who says it…
The hardest trade of the world: human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their life and their health while carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others which work literally in hell.
It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn a living while carrying the sulphur of the volcano Kawah Ijen, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work each until the underground of the crater, where the sulphuric gas emanating from the entrails of the ground is solidified in contact with the air.
After having collected large sulphur rocks, which weigh on the whole nearly 70 kilos, it installs them in two shopping carts in bamboo which it charges on its shoulders through the steep paths.
There are only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano which culminates with 2.386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers put more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, with a pace of tortoise, by keeping balance and measuring their steps not to stumble and fall into the chasm.
They know that a false step could cost them the life, as that arrived to a French tourist who fell a deadly fall in the volcano Kawah Ijen several years ago.
The minors of Kawah Ijen gain 5 centimes of euro for each kilo of extracted sulphur.
Once in top, it frayent a way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were animals of circus, and carrying the heavy shopping carts painfully, they go the 3 kilometers to the balance which a mining company installed a little downwards with 1.850 meters of altitude.
It is about Pt Candi Ngrimbi, a company which exploits the volcano since 1960 and, one can say it, its employees, with whom he pays 662 rupees Indonesian (5 centimes of euro) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it with 10.000 rupees (83 centimes of euro) with petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in the daily life and is used to manufacture candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and is even used to bleach sugar.
“As we transport approximately 70 kilos, we gain approximately 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) with each travel”, explains us Anto, which makes three journeys per day in general.
Each one takes 3 hours to him and it finishes exhausted, but that enables him to gain 138.000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although that appears to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is triple of what it would gain in the fields.
“The income of the minors is very here high, where the harvest of the coffee is paid 15.000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the monthly average wages are of two million rupees (167 euros)”, the carrier declares which worked formerly as mason on the tourist island of Bali.
Over there, its wages were of 75.000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not also difficult, but Anto returned close to its family in Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason which, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulphur: “I married an young girl of Bali, where they are hindouists, and I brought back it to Java so that it converts with Islam”.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and its eyes are irritated by poison gazs.
At 27 years, it passed three of its life to defy the danger on Kawah ljen, but sulphur already started to make him pay the invoice although it covers the face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and its eyes are irritated by poison gazs rejected by the volcano.
It is the price which it must pay to continue its dreamed.
“I will work two more years, because I want to open a shop or to study Spanish or French” promises he in English more than acceptable.
Abused by the life, this nice and intelligent young person could be tourist guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead of that, it does the work of a mule.
It shares an unhealthy wood hovel with other carriers, is lifted each day to a height of two hours of the morning because sulphur does not cease spouting out the night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto goes down in the crater in lighting with a small lamp fixed at its helmet, which it bought itself with its own money.
Some 400 carriers load the shopping carts with sulphur on their shoulders since the bottom of the crater.
In spite of its comfortable benefit, the mining company did not mechanize the extraction of sulphur to save the costs and does not provide any equipment to the carriers which work on their account and are paid with the weight.
Moreover, they do not touch either under 30.000 rupees (2.50 euros) of increase per camera, besides the entry of 15.000 rupees (1.20 euros), that the guards of this natural park invoice with the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and his human mules.
“This work is made for the animals, not for the human ones”, protests Madrusin, a corpulent carrier 42 years which has worked in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since it left the college.
Able to carry up to 110 kilos, it ensures that it will not stop working “as long as it will be able it”, because it needs money to raise his 3 sons, old between 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is all my life.
Although sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the minors in the thick columns of smoke which leave the volcano, they are so hardened that nobody complains to suffer from the serious diseases… to which are added obviously their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritides, pains in the knees and the shoulders, deformed by the weight of the shopping carts.
By balancing the shopping cart on its back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only charge 50 kilos.
Each day, its companions and extract 15 tons to him from sulphur of the volcano, that three trucks transport to the warehouse of Tamansari, to 18 kilometers from there by a path of goats invaded by weeds.
“I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is all my life”, Unainik affirms by opening the mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The elder one of his/her five children, 30 years old, also works like sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but misery from generation to generation perpetuates one of the most difficult trades in the world: that which the human mules of the volcano Kawah ljen do.
Singapore searches babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans throw the responsibility for this absence of children on the career, the stress and the cost of the access to the property.
“The population of Singapore must develop”.
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fill our civic duty and give the life!
It can appear incredible that these words come from a publicity for pastilles to mint, but in spite of that, or perhaps thanks to that, the video was spread like a powder trail on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a group of rap which uses local references as “will put Punchinello in the drawer” to make fun of the birth rate of Singapore.
BBH, the advertising agency at the origin of the video, hope to draw attention to the problem in a way amusing thanks to this publicity.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, declared that it wished to use the power of the music so that people fill “their national duty”.
It is intended only for the Internet, we thus could return it diverting and amusing.
It is the principal problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of the birthrate, thus we felt that it was a topic that we must approach.
We knew that the government had tried several things like launching perfumes to the phéromones or organizing evenings of speed-dating.
Many of these ideas were creative but they inevitably did not function.
We thus said ourselves the following thing: what could be more creative to solve this problem than to make a song of rap of it?
1.2 children
The government of Singapore does not take it as much with the light one.
He spends 1.300 US dollars a year in policies to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A measurement of the government in favour as of marriages and the fathers grants to 15.000 dollars per child, lengthens the maternity leave and distributes pre-tax profits.
But all that had few effects.
Singapore is city-state rich and of high technology of the South-east of Asia, such a known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, in accordance with its national distribution of population, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time that it was above 2, regarded as the it, renewal rate was in 1976.
Why thus the Singaporeans have don't more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the policies of the marriage and the family of the National Division of the Population, affirms that it is due to a “better education” and with “a broader choice of career appropriatenesses”.
“That made it possible to people to have a broader range of options in terms of objectives of life and priorities, beyond the marriage and of the constitution of a family”, she explains.
These changes of the social norms contributed to the increase amongst single people and to delay the marriage and the births, which has as a result a reduction in birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aiming at radically increasing immigration to counter the reduction in the population created a resentment within the local population.
In Singapore, one finds Web sites who abounds a xenophobia hardly disguised against the new immigrants, in particular towards the Chinese who are shown to draw the wages to the bottom and not to be integrated.
The increase in immigration is also perceived as one of the reasons for which the party in place in Singapore knew last year its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they tried to correct the problem with the installation of quotas and higher taxes for the foreign workers.
Unhoped-for consequences
Whereas the fall of birth rate has effects known on the economic growth of a country, the tax incomes, the medical costs and the immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unexpected consequences.
The government tries to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, that started to affect the real sector.
The authorities of the urban development started to control the number of small apartments, known under the name of “box with shoes”, being able to be built in given zones of the city.
These apartments have a surface of 46 square meters and their sale gains much success.
However, the authorities are worried by the fact that they can promote a lifestyle of single person and discourage the promoters wishing to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, chief executive officer of real estate company EL Developers, affirms that its “boxes with shoes” are sold much more quickly than the larger residences.
They are more popular, in the direction where these residences are built much more quickly than those of bigger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasury.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to the promoters, with which one put before sticks in the wheels if they wished to propose too many small residences in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-State.
If as well is as these new regulations can be a step towards the increase in national birth rate, while discussing with the Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the center, it would seem that they will not have much effects.
“People are very stressed, the houses are expensive, just like education, therefore people gives it to later”, a junior manager declares.
The other people can have children.
“But for me, it is important to be able to have my money and of my time”, another young person of about twenty years declares us.
The men and the women mention their career, the stress and the cost of the access to the property and education like the reasons preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the government tries to convince its citizens to have children, when it is a question of making babies, they are the Singaporeans themselves which have the last word.
What is private off line is private online
Privacy
In accordance with the Dictionary of the Academy Royale Espagnole, it is quality the private field or “the private field of the life which we can protect from any intrusion”.
What comes under the field deprived for less than 16 years?
How to apply this definition in the daily life and on the social networks?
Does it understand the dangers to which it is exposed while diffusing on Internet of the events that it would certainly not share off line?
The newspaper elPeriódico questioned five young boys, old between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the fabric.
In four of the cases, they associated the term “something of very personal” on the personal plan and “the password and user name” when they applied it to the social networks.
“I will not reveal my most personal secrecies in a post”, Jorge, ten years affirms, when it tries to explain the significance of the term deprived on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it has had an account for two years.
“They are very secret secrecies, my mother can know them but not everyone”, he affirms.
On BFR, I post nice images or games.
I also discuss with my friends.
“I will not share one of my photographs or somebody which would make the imbecile”, he says.
The young boy recognizes that it is badly to publish obscene photographs, stripped people, crimes or to write humiliating comments or violent one.
Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 friends on BFR like his nine subscribers on Twitter.
The majority are of the family.
His/her mother in fact part, it knows the password of the one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express and write interesting tweets.
“I do not know if they answer me, I post them simply”, he adds.
“The social networks are amusing, I can speak with distant parents or with my friends, in a fast way”, he says.
He affirms that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He will not trust either somebody who would recommend a foreigner to him.
The case of Jose, 14 years, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on this last, it admits not to know 20 of the people registered on her list of friends.
“That does not worry me because we have something in common, music for example”, he declares.
According to the young boy, nobody made him advances nor did not ask him his address or for his phone number.
“If they put the pressure to me or required it, I would remove them simply my account”, he recognizes.
Jose subscribed in Ask after having read a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiments which one knows today under the name of cyberstalking are not foreign to the young boy.
A close relation of one of my friends was racketeered on a social network.
They threatened it and required money.
“It never knew which it was” ensures it.
The victim, according to Jose, did not close its account.
“It only passed it in private profile”.
He explains us then a series of handling to configure his account in a sure way.
Unlike Jorge, this young person would post photographs of knowledge in situations uncomfortable or embarrassing.
Yes, I would make it if I were annoyed or irritated.
“Even if I know that it is cyberstalking”, he affirms.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, professor of English and laid off in Education and Training, considers that, to direct the children and the teenagers, one must understand that the goal of the social networks is to inform.
“The Internet has emerges like a means of seeking information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rules of the game changed”, she mentions.
Porras announces that the academician Marc Prensky, who has a master degree in pedagogy of the university of Yale and author of the book “digital Natives and immigrants”, uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives, it is them, the children and the young people who were born with technology.
“Us, we are the digital immigrants who must teach to them there, whereas we are ourselves learning”, she says.
It adds that the topic is complex, “because we ask them to have a criterion defined on what it is or not advisable to reveal, to publish or say in an age where they do not have maturity necessary to do it”.
“We also let us ask them to be selective whereas what imports to them more is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences” she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective manner to teach the confidentiality with the children and the teenagers is to use questions which make them reflect.
“To tell Them not to do it is not used for nothing”, she affirms.
Then, Porras enumerates some examples: are there things which you would not tell with a foreigner, why do do it you on the Internet?
Or, that you would it like that they publish a photograph of you as that of a friend whom you published?
Do you know what the others publish on you?
When you do you identify photographs of festivals, requests to the other people the permission to identify them?
And also, everyone does it need to know what you do at every moment?
Another point is to render comprehensible to them that they must act online as they do it off line.
They are the same rules.
“Out of the Internet, each one must act with respect, morality and other principles, that must be similar on the social networks”, she affirms.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, professor of university, primary education teacher and advisor of education, declare that it is essential that the parents conscientiously read the conditions of use of the social networks.
By including each term, they will have strong foundations to discuss with their children the implications the opening an account on Internet.
“For example, the age and what it is allowed to share or publish”, he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to recall the children whom one should not speak the abroads.
The top of Unasur finished without the Declaration of Lima being made public
The Life presidential top of the Union of the South American nations (Unasur) finished today in Peru without the Declaration of Lima being made public, although she was announced previously and theoretically adopted by the 7 agents present.
Efe tried on several occasions to reach the document signed at the time of the Ordinary Life Réunion of the Heads of States and government of Unasur, but the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the presidency announced at the beginning that it would be revealed after the top closure, then affirmed that it would be published from one moment to another on the website of the Peruvian government.
When they were questioned on the text, they announced that its contents had been reported on the president of Peru, Ollante Humala, at the time of short declarations to the press.
The access of the journalists to information concerning the top was constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message “session private, audio restricted” was diffused in the press room.
The little of information which circulated between the journalists was those given by the press agents of some of the governments of Unasur who assisted with go, except for Peruvian spokesperson.
The single document revealed at the time of the day was the list of the presidents present, which caused a certain discomfort at the hundreds of journalists of various national mediums and international which claimed more important information.
Later, the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the “final declaration” of the top, but it was the speech of president Humala and not of the official document which concluded the top.
Last October, Peru was the host of the 3rd America top of the Arab South-Countries (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although that was required with authority by the press, he had not diffused either the declaration called also Declaration of Lima, as that had been previously announced.
On the official site of the ASPA, one can check that the document was published in the month of last March.
In both go international, the Peruvian authorities tried to set up sure systems of transmission for all the journalists, but they limited to the maximum obtaining of information.
The top was also concluded with the joint agreement from Chile and Peru to accept a judgement of the Court of The Hague which slices different frontier between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the time of the appointment regional and stated that they would respect the decision of the CIJ to hear the pleas of the two parts in the lawsuit that Lima brought against Santiago and who starts Monday in The Hague.
“We will respect and carry out the verdict which will solve the disagreements that we carry today before this international court”, president Humala stated, at the side of his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile always was, and will continue to be a respectful country of the international law, peaceful resolution of the controversies, treaties and international courts”, president Piñera added by giving a handful of hand to president Humala, beside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents whom they would subject to the CIJ took place after Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogota by which it had agreed to be subjected to the decisions of this international court, after a decision on the maritime limits with Nicaragua which it regarded as seriously erroneous.
The top was taken place without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended of Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not take part in go.
The president host, Ollanta Humala, were charged to open the deliberations the morning and to close the top shortly after midday in Lima.
The agent read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been fixed between the South American countries for a total of 17 million dollars of investment.
Among the adopted agreements, it mentioned that the countries of Unasur would set up “important approachs to achieve the goal of the South American citizenship by the development of agreements on the residence permits”.
It informed that actions would be installation to improve the “co-operation in the fight against the urban insecurity and the international organized crime, of the actions for a better accessibility with the drugs, the access to the Internet at low prices in the totality of South America, and to evaluate in a joint and effective way the risks of natural disasters”.
With Europe in crisis, “the economic consolidation (of the Latin America) should not have a matrix triumphalist person but must help to increase our productive matrix and to foresee a better future for our populations”, president Humala concluded.
“We decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects which improve the connection of spaces of South America, in particular in the rural areas and frontier… by linking our countries and by generating new economic channels”, the president Peruvian at the time of a speech stated.
Among these projects, it mentioned that five related to Peru and were on the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two aimed at a more important connection with Ecuador although it did not give fuller details.
In the same way, the final document mentions the political situation of Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its rehabilitation within the Union of the South American Nations”, from which it is currently excluded.
The need which the Latin America remains an area of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relationships with its neighbors, is another topic approached at the time of the top.
In this direction, the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, stated, before beginning to it appointment regional, which he hoped to meet his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, saturdays following to Mexico City to discuss the maritime disagreement calmly through judgement of the CIJ requested by Bogota.
“It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I hold a meeting with president Daniel Ortega”, declared president Santos.
“We will revise all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua which will require to have a discussion with this country”, he underlined.
“I hope to be able to say to president Ortega whom we will regulate that in the possible most civilized and respectful way”, president Santos added.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City where they envisaged to attend the catch to be able of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Same manner, within the framework of the top, the Ministers for the Defense of the block will meet beforehand to approve the Action plan of the year 2013, which tries to reinforce the dialogue and the consensus in terms of defense in the area.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although this last country is suspended.
Peru takes the presidency pro tempore regional block.
“South America must learn from Europe how to integrate a citizenship”, Rafael Correa declares.
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, affirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which “South America, in this case, was to take as a model Europe”.
President Correa, who took part in the Life top of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur), located at Lima, declared on television State, TV Péru, that Europeans “had to kill each other at the time of the Second World War” and of other conflicts, “but which they formed now almost a fatherland”.
In this direction, it defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
“It is necessary to arrive at freedom of movement of the citizens and the workers in any South American country, as it is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there remain still fields reactionaries which we want to make belong to the past” it informed.
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president showed himself in favour of the reconstitution of the Organization of the American States (OAS) with the objective to decrease the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and to take into account the signatories of the pact of San José on the human rights.
Those which reshuffle us the ears never do not compromise anything, contrary, us, the South American ones, all signed it.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission of the human rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States”, he affirmed, by alluding to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, because he did not betray itself his principles, but he on the contrary respected his “deep democratic values and of the human rights”.
He concluded that at the time, “there were founded suspicions according to which Assange would be extradited towards a third country and that its lawsuit would not be respected”.
Moreover, he criticizes the Swedish justice which required that he subject himself on his territory to a interrogation concerning a sexual offence supposed whereas “the proper Swedish legislation makes it possible to do it by videoconference, which could be done since the embassy from Ecuador in London”.
Correa affirmed that there was a risk that the mental health and physical of Assange worsens.
“I did not speak to him since it is in our embassy, but the ambassadress informed me that it had pulmonary small problems, but nothing low register”, affirmed the Ecuadorian president.
It is possible that its physical and mental health worsens by the fact of being locked up in a small space without being able to do exercises with the free air.
“That acts on the health of no matter whom”, he concludes.
Correa announces that solution of asylum granted to Assange since June in embassy Ecuadorian of London, which would be the attribution of a safe conduct which would enable him to go to Ecuador, is between the hands of Great Britain, of Sweden and of the European legal authorities and it stresses that it had discussions in London in order to find a solution with the seclusion of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with the human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there were permanent discussions.
“The solution with this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, of Sweden and of the European legal authorities because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, launched a whole series of procedures near various European authorities”, he mentioned.
And he thinks that “if Great Britain granted the safe conduct as of tomorrow, that would finish”.
And if Sweden, as its legislation allows it completely, and as it already did in other cases, questioned Mr. Assange in the embassy from Ecuador to London, or questioned it via Skype tomorrow, the problem would be also solved.
Correa benefitted from it to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and it specified that what it did not tolerate was “the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lies which harm freedom of expression”.
“The largest enemies of freedom of the press are not the malevolent or perverse politicians but the bad journalists in the pay of greed, of the blackmail and the extortion”, he declared.
Under this angle, he was pleased that is this kind of journalists “neither the bankers nor the hegemonic countries and middle-class man who dominates in Ecuador” and, rather than to propose his re-election, “he would look further into the revolution to carry on the way and to trace the right track”.
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay within Unasur at least until the next elections, while arguing that the organization “was to be firm and not to tolerate the opportunism and the disguised coup attempts of State”, because actually, “that destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy”.
Who more is, the Ecuadorian president regards as “perfectly relevant” the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries by the means of the judgement of the International court of The Hague, which will reinforce the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
For the moment, this judgement is not respected.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
The conflicts are inevitable, but they must be exceeded by the will to advance together.
They should be solved as a whole to exceed them and go from the front one.
In same time, it is known as trustful in the good resolution of the litigation concerning the maritime borders which opposes Peru and Chile within the same court and it affirmed that it is “beneficial which the Latin America seizes the international authorities if the two countries agree to accept a judgement so firm that it is”.
In reference to the possibility of its presentation like candidate with the future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to aspire to a third consecutive mandate, it announced that it saw this possibility “with much optimism and joy, although that is sometimes rather difficult”.
Correa ensured that, if it lost the primary educations of February 2013, it would withdraw public life.
At the personal level, the power never interested me, but in situations as unjust as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can be solved only by the means it political power.
“My political movement believed that it was me which guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility”, he affirmed.
If I gained, it would be my last presidential mandate and I will withdraw myself then political life.
If ever we lose, I will also do it.
“It is my decision”, he affirmed.
Correa also has refers to the new medical care of the president Venezuelan, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just discussed with the vice-president Venezuelan Nicolás Maduro and he told me that a medical care of routine was already planned and that he expected the end of the campaign to go back to Cuba.
“That does not mean relapse of the health status of president Chávez”, he commented on.
The Head of Ecuadorian State took part today in Lima with the Life top of the heads of state and government of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur) which ended in a call to a better regional integration in order to support progress, the equality and the security.
The deaths related to the AIDS are due to a late detection today.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when him the result of the test was assure: HIV positive.
“It is as if the sky had fallen to me on the head”, he says while referring at the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make “less painful”, in vain.
The young man hid it with his family.
It decided to only take care of its disease and started to get information about it and its eagerness was such as it has just celebrated its 43e birthday.
It is, without any doubt, one of the most former patients of the unit of the VIH of the civil hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), in which it was found in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the virus of the human immunodeficiency (VIH) for 22 years, something of difficult to imagine at the beginning of the Nineties, where there were many doubts, little choice of treatment and more marks.
Then, even the director of a private clinic of the IMSS avoided telling him goodbye “because it was without voice”.
In this time, to have the AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and to have a good quality of life.
However, being unaware of their disease, of many people still arrive when the virus already caused damage, “exhausted” their immune system and are opportunist victims of infections.
31 years after the appearance of the AIDS in the world, in all the cases after the first announced cases, “the great victory is today that the survival of a patient having begun a treatment the convenient period and survival from the population in general are exactly the same one”, the chief of the unit of the VIH of the HCG indicated, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it takes for reference which this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The infectiologist and expert in VIH/sida, Andrade Villanueva, commented on that since 2008, the scientists concluded that the AIDS was not any more one fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level on assignment on the immune system which the patients presented at the time of the diagnosis, with better prospects for those not consuming drugs: up to 30 years for a rate of CD4 of 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4.
To speak simply, that means that for somebody who would receive a positive diagnosis VIH at 25 years, “as long as it will remain under control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years”, explained the questioned scientist.
In order to replace this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of the Mexicans is 76 years today on average.
If it is true that mortality decreased these last years significantly, in the case of Mexico, the number of people deceased of the continuations of the AIDS passed from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of ONUSIDA), but it is also true that, since the appearance of the AIDS, 60% of the patients listed on the national database died.
Only in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May this year; however, it is ensured us that the access to the antirétroviraux drugs is universal since 2005.
Then why y-a it still of the deaths?
I think that the problem does not come from the access to the treatment.
It is as that I see it, it is what occurred in our hospital.
Over the 12 last years at least, we never missed drugs, the problem is that the patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or then they learn it at stages advanced from the disease.
It gives us to an indisputable fact “new patients on ten arrive whereas they present already an opportunist infection, which it is necessary to have a greater impact on total mortality, it is to carry out earlier diagnoses and, for that, it is necessary to propose screening tests in a massive way, with all the people who ask it”.
The specialists and the members of the Council of State of prevention of the AIDS of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, just as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who has to make his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, in spite of his young age, it was already carrying the AIDS and suffered from the sarcoma from Kaposi, a cancerous tumour which is one of the current complications.
Any exchange when you learn that you have the AIDS.
Some think that they will die and wants nothing to know.
“If I will die, it is better that I burst myself three times per week”, it they say is not my case.
The change was beneficial, I eat well, I do exercise, I take my medicines.
To date, his/her parents know only that he suffers from a cancer.
I have a normal life, like no matter whom of other.
“I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but jointly responsible, I pay attention to me and the other person”, Fabrizio tells, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to its testimony, those which are afraid today, at the time of the walk of the World Day against the AIDS.
That they make the test, if they took chances, more they will know early if they are HIV positive and better it is, and if they have already the diagnosis, it is necessary that they know that one can live like everyone, while being responsible.
Its message summarizes the slogan of the battle against the AIDS in this year 2012.
Condoms on the counter
It there has many gaps between the programs of health and the ordinary citizen, supports Ricardo Salazar, journalist of Guadalajara which embraced the cause of the VIH.
And largest resides in the prevention.
In all the places dedicated to that, “one actually increased the distribution of the condoms, before one gave of them us one or two, now one gives us packages of one hundred of them, it is very well, but it results from it, that still today, some do not have access to the condoms”, he affirms.
Among most vulnerable to the new infections, one finds the teenagers.
The question: “What will you make some? ”, posed with sarcastic remark and value judgments by the social workers, the careers advisers, the pharmacists and the health professionals, is the question which the teenagers do not have desire for hearing, the journalist ensures.
He proposes to reorientate this ineffective distribution; that the condoms are not only sold with the counters, but that one finds them in the distributors of the public toilets and the places which attend the young people.
It is not a question of encouraging promiscuity.
It is not a question either of paying them the girls and the motel, as had answered the governor Emilio González when it had been asked to him whether there would be a distribution of the condoms within his administration.
“It is not as that which sexuality functions, best is to sexually provide condoms to the already active people”, he underlined.
Figures with Jalisco
13.435 cumulated cases are counted (12.158 from the AIDS and 1.317 of the VIH).
The State is the 4th State of the country of number of the new cases and cumulated cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of the patients of the VIH.
92% of the contaminations are done by sexual way, 6% per blood way and 2% per perinatal way.
It is estimated that 50.000 people live with the VIH, since for each recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who are unaware of it.
A judgement ratified in call by a court of the United States is unaware of the reorganization of the debt of the Vitro group agreed via a commercial bankruptcy to Mexico. The scenario causes a harmful precedent for all the national companies having of the ramifications in the adjoining countries and having problems of solvency.
One would thus say that the procedures of survival of the companies authorized by the Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the spangled banner, to opposite course to the international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow dealt to the judgement returned on June 15th by judge Harlin Hale of the Court of the bankruptcies for the northern district of Texas, leaves the Mexican companies without defense vis-a-vis the possibility of embargo of their properties beyond the Cheer.
However, the resolution will make it possible to the principal manufacturer of glass of Mexico to seize the Supreme court of the United States while being based on three inconsistencies.
Initially, whereas the judge of the cause announces that the creditors must be recorded according to the law on the bankruptcies of the United States, the court of call of the fifth circuit, sitting at New-Orleans, affirms that the principal procedure is the commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico.
The first point would imply to denounce the co-operation of international procedure in the cases of insolvency of companies having a transnational profile.
In fact, the Model law of the United Nations for the Uniformity of the International trade law had been created for this purpose by taking American Law Institute like referee.
In the second place, the judgement establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by subsidiaries of Vitro towards the parent company, the necessary majority for the approval of the reorganization could not have been obtained.
However, the Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are here half a dozen examples, among which Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose Federal Institute of the Commercial Bankruptcies had guarantees the debts.
Moreover, which is certain is that, since there remained the votes of the subsidiaries, all the ways the creditors of Vitro who fought against that in the courts of the United States, i.e. the funds “vulture” like Capital Aurelios, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been of 45 votes against 37.
A data omitted by the court of call.
On another side, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation that it met since 2008 without stopping with the economic serious attack which faced the United States, reflecting the costs with the country.
For the moment, the company of the family González Sada will lodge call in front of the same court of call so that the vote takes place in its totality, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The recourse of insurance will claim not-prosperity and requires the revision of the lawsuit by a higher authority, in this case the Supreme court of Justice of the United States.
Most serious is that the court was unaware of a document sent by the government of Mexico in the name of the amicus curiae (“friend of the Court”) in which was detailed the procedure followed by Vitro within the framework of the law on the commercial bankruptcies, by announcing that released it from the conventions signed by the two countries to put it at the same level as subparagraph 15 of the law on the bankruptcies of the United States.
Moreover, it announces that the country yielded with the principles of the Commission of the United Nations concerning the International trade, i.e. the rules fixed in the case of transborder insolvency, which guarantees equity for the debtors and the creditors.
Pile-up of two parts: they strike Vitro and they strike the country.
General assessment
The complaints of the trade unions of the Mexican Company of Aviation against the ex-owner to the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were overlooked during several months, this one was shown of fraudulent administration, the Property owners' syndicate of the Pilot Aviators already encountered problems.
The authority, overseen by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just presented a penal request against the Banking National Commission and of the Values which is shown of obstruction to justice.
According to him, the authority of inspection systematically denied to have provides information to the Prosecutor Général of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to withdraw F/589 trust of the bank 9TH 198 pesos million in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of Professional actions of the Administration of the Hotels.
As each one knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the principal shareholder of the chain of Posadas hotel.
They besiege the Mart Dragon
Join together in the end of the week in an amphitheatre of the University of the Caribbean, a group of ecologists national and foreign, professors of university, entrepreneurs and members of the civil society approved the creation of a broad face of opposition to the unveiling of Chinese the Mart Dragon in Cancun.
As you know it, we speak about a colossal center of sale and distribution in Mexico, in Central America and with the Caribbean of products of the country of the great wall, with a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra (the National Room of Industry and the Transformation) had succeeds in linking the governors of the zone of South-east in order to be opposed to the monumental project which is partly on protected areas and represents largest of all the threats weighing on industry.
The ACTA died
The government proposed a requirement of the senate to explain under which terms and circumstances the ambassador of Mexico in Japan had signed the Trade agreement Anti-counterfeit, known under his English initials of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of the Intellectual property, this topic is already of the ancient history.
As each one knows, that was done well that the senate itself condemned this possibility, because she was regarded as a breach of liberty of expression on the social networks.
Long-term Homex
With an aim of paying long-term debts without affecting those in the short run, the property developer Homex launched out on the market of the Stock exchange for 500 million pesos.
This emission of titles is the first of the four emissions for which they propose to pay interests every 28 days.
Birth of Competival

The investments in this field exceed the 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor “Hetin” Reyes “The basketball is all my life”
The sphere-trotter of the basketball “Hetin” Reyes passed more than 60 years of its life in relation to the ground and, thanks to him, travelled in the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as large as that of Héctor “Hetin” Reyes.
The reason is that before a cerebral hemorrhage condemns it to the wheel chair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport during more than 60 years, that is as a player of lower leagues, player of the national team of tennis shoe, a manager and directing of the national team, the BSN, with Vaqueros de Bayamón or as a president of the federation of basketball.
“I carried several caps in the basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, chief executive officer of the national team and president of the federation during the Nineties”, remembers Reyes at the time of a visit of Will precede Hora at his place in Bayamón, where it resides with Isabel, its faithful wife since more than 50 years.
“The basketball is all my life”.
Reyes does not exaggerate when it makes this assertion.
The walls of its house, almost all decorated with photographs and memories which point out its route except standards, testify some.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all its memories, those which it is fond of more are those which point out to him its passage as player within the team of Vaqueros in the middle of the Fifties until 1982, after having spent 15 years as a Co-manager or to manage of the team.
“That was my best years, those of which I the most profited because I was likely to take part in eight championships of Vaqueros starting from 1967, whether it is like managing, Co-manager or leader.
That done many years of satisfaction, including the five championships disputed of 1971 to 1975.
I then withdrew myself at the time of the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy entered the team of the BSN.
From there, “Cuco” Ortiz, which was a large administrator, took the lead in the team”, Reyes indicates.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been leading here and which was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: “I have a player strapping man for you, it measures two meters.
You want it?”
It is like that to begin Mincy, one of the best players than had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse to me, who was naturalized and who was one better gunners.
I remember that he said that if Mincy had made it possible Bayamon to gain a championship, Mocks was going to help us to try to gain another of them.
He east is delighted by the championship of Vaqueros with Mocks, but only remotely since in 1988 he was already the big shot of the federation.
In this time, he preferred to benefit as of his loads and from those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we gained it for the first time in the United States at the time of the pre-Olympic tournament of Mexico City in 1989.
Then, there was the World one of 1990, where we arrived 4th and where we should have gained the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not made us play again the last match, declared Reyes.
Is the team of World of 1990 the best national team than you saw?
She belongs to best, just like that which beat Dream TEAM at the time of the Olympic Games of 2004.
But my preferred is that of the Pan-American Games of Cuba in 1991, when we gained gold and that we put a beating to the team of the United States, which was rather similar to that which had gained bronze at the time of the World one.
This team was not only made up of Mincy, Mocks, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and “Piculín” (Ortiz), there were also the young people (Javier) “Toñito” Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario “Quijote” Morals, which had not been able to attend world of 90 because of a problem of knees.
A team which was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy at the time of the pre-Olympic tournament of Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like “Canito” Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young person Rolando Hourruitiner to replace the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan-American Games of Mar del Plata, we gained gold against all the forecasts.
Which was the best player of Puerto Rico?
Without any doubt, it is about Piculín Ortiz.
Its statistics on the level as of international tournaments are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico dominated on this level like made Piculín.
And that without taking into account its trajectory in the various leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Porto Rican leader?
It is very difficult to say.
We had a good team made up of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In the young people, I like much work that made Leo Arill.
For you, which is your greater success within the federation?
To have been part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that at the beginning of the years 1990, the BSN counted to 17 teams in one season.
What remains you to be made?
There are things which I would have liked to set up, like the regionalisation of the minor categories.
For example that the boys of Pounce play only in their zone and face only teams of the other corners of the island at the time of the national play-offs.
Today, the young people travel and play too much whereas that is not inevitably necessary.
I at least saw the advantage of obligatory certifications and the courses for the leaders, the staff field and the referees.
That returns to me happy.
What do you make today?
In general, I listen to music, I look at clips of my time on YouTube, I benefit from my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend matches of basketball.
And of course, I benefit from the company from my wife, Isabel, which always was at my sides.
Died of the actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21st, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), was universally made know by the main role of John Ross Ewing, more known under the name of J.R., in the televised series “Dallas”, in which it incarnated a businessman without scruples, frightening and manipulator.
Larry Hagman, whose role of oil tycoon without scruple J.R. Ewing in the televised series “Dallas” became a symbol of avarice in the years 1980, is deceased.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, which had returned this year in the role of J.R in a new season of “Dallas”, is deceased Friday evening complications of a cancer, according to an official statement of the family sent to The associated Near for Warner Bros. , production company of “Dallas”.
“Larry was of return in his dear birthplace of Dallas, again playing the ironic part which he liked more”, the family declared.
The family of Larry and her close friends were with him in Dallas in this bank holiday of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of his wife in the original series and the continuation, was with Hagman when it is deceased in a hospital of Dallas, declared his press agent, Jeffrey Lane.
It brought the joy to all those which knew it.
It was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and much I will miss it.
“It was a person of exception and he lived the life at bottom”, Gray in an official statement declared.
The doctors had diagnosed a hepatic cirrhosis with Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had admitted having drunk much during many years.
In 1995, one had detected a malignant tumour with the liver to him and it had undergone a Clerc's Office.
Several years before “Dallas”, Hagman had been made known on television in the role of an ordinary type in the series “Jinny of my dreamed” diffused by the NBC chain of 1965 to 1970.
In this one, he interpreted the role of the captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a tempting genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and that he brought back it at his place.
He also played in two comedies which remained little of time to the antenna, “The Good Life” (NBC, 1971-72) and “Young stag We Go Again” (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles with the cinema, one finds roles received well by the critic in “the group”, “Harry and Tonto” and “Primary Colors”.
But it was thanks to its masterly interpretation in a delicious way hateful J.R. that Larry Hagman had greater success.
The drama series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and their close relations were diffused from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan “Which killed J.R.? ”, invented to maintain suspense around an episode full with emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost assassinated, generated speculations in the whole world and of the million dollars played in bets.
Thanks to that, inter alia, the series reached a record of audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in an episode of November 1980, 41 million televiewers was on average in front of their screen and made of “Dallas” the second program of entertainment more looked in the world, after the final episode of “MASH” in 1983, which had gathered 50 million televiewers.
It was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had drawn to him above.
J.R. had put pregnant and had then threatened it to show it of prostitution if it did not leave the city, but other people had also reasons to attack it.
Hagman played the part of Ewing like a corrupted and insatiable man but to the charismatic smile: an entrepreneur dishonest person and an unfaithful husband who tried to make intern his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
“I know what it would be necessary like epitaph for J.R”, Hagman declared in 1988.
One should write: “Ci-to lie honest citizen J.R. Ewing”.
Here the single part which it lost.
Victoria Principal, coprotagonist of the original series, remembered this Friday of Hagman like immense man “, as well on the small screen as in the life”.
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for million fans throughout the world, and in the heart of each one among us, who had the chance to know it and like it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of “Dallas” were diffused a few months ago with a great success on chain TNT.
The recording of five episodes is already finished for the second season and sixth is under development, informed the chain.
For the moment, neither Warner nor chain TNT communicated on the way in which the death of Hagman in the series will be integrated.
Originating in Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who knew the celebrity with classical works like “South Pacific” and “Peter Pan”.
Mary Martin was still a teenager when it gave him the day in 1931 whereas it was married with the lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the scenes of the theatres of New York at the beginning of the years 1950 then was used in the air force of 1952 for 1956 in England.
It is over there that it met the young Swedish decorator of interior Maj Axelsson and that it married it.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where reside of many celebrities.
In 2001, it entitled its memories “Hello Darlin ': Tall (and Absolutely True) Bruise about My Life” (in French: Hello Darlin ': Pitiless memories of J.R)
“I did not write anything in this book which can wound somebody or affect it some manner that it is”, he declared with the press at this time.
After its clerk's office of the liver, it became a militant credit of the donation of organs and worked like volunteer in a hospital to assist the anxious patients.
“I advise them, I give again confidence to them, I come with them when they come to be made operate and afterwards”, he tells in 1996.
I try to offer a little comfort to them, as “are not afraid, that will not be easy during a small moment, but that well will go”.
It was also militant against the tobacco and took part in several campaigns.
A treating course of the “End of the world” has just started
Each week, the students explore apocalyptic topics like the nuclear war, the zombies, the viruses and the germs and climate warming.
This six-month period, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, it knew that it launched an irresistible hook there: the end of “large deducts” calendar Maya, on December 21st, to which refer of many people as being the proof of the imminent end of the world.
But professor Charmé did not have any idea from what awaited it during following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax pit that some called “Armageddon of the debt” and a conflict growing implying Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end of time thought that would start the apocalypse.
“I did not realize that was going to be the most apocalyptic six-month period which I never knew”, this week professor Charmé with his students of the University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey) declared.
If one analyzes what occurred in the world today as if we were 30 days later and that we say it, that was a very good period.
And it should be remembered that what is bad is good for those which believe in the apocalypse.
And he is not the only professor to give courses on “the end of the world” this six-month period, which will be, in theory, the last of the history.
With Temple, the assistant professor Barry Vacker exempts the course “Media, culture and end of the world”.
Each week, the students explore apocalyptic topics like the nuclear war, the zombies, the viruses and the germs and climate warming.
“We analyze that because these ideas proliferate with time”, he declared, and the way in which they offer hypothetical scenarios guides a certain human control.
If the nuclear armament fell into the hands from terrorists, for example, a war could burst.

“We add “2012” to have the possibility of giving the course again, if the world does not disappear”, professor Restall declared.
In spite of the “imminent disaster”, the students must study, create projects and pass their final examinations.
In the State of Pennsylvania, the final examination will have passed the Apocalypse day before, which does not leave the student of another choice to work “until the night even of the end of the world supposed”, Restall declared.
The courses appeared rather popular.
“It was complete in two hours”, affirmed Restall in connection with its course intended for the high level students, composed of 35 students.
We received messages by e-mail several weeks before the beginning of the six-month period, on behalf of people who asked whether there were still place.

“Our first project treated Maya prophecy, and in a certain manner discredited we it”, declares Julie zegle, student of last year with Temple, 21 years old and originating in West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world, it acts only of one key date on the calendar, declared Restall.
But I concede that there exists an anxiety related to the apocalypse in the Occidental culture, tonic at several centuries, which makes that people react to the changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet caused a rise of these speculations.
“In other places of the sphere, people does not think of that”, he ensures.

Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion of the University the Room which gives courses to Philippines this year, answered quickly when it was asked to him whether it knew that one gave here courses on “the end of the world”.
“Philippines do not take part at the end of the world”, to us-have it answered, as if it were about an exception coming from a higher authority.
We have a grace of the Pope.
Restall points out that over the years, one spoke about the many supposed dates of the last judgement, and he affirms that if nothing occurs on December 21st, “people will immediately start to think of the next date” or to philosophize on the fact that on December 21st marks the one 7 years period beginning at the end of which the world will disappear.
The students and the professors take the date with the light one.
Several told us that they thought of going to festivals “of the end of the world”.
