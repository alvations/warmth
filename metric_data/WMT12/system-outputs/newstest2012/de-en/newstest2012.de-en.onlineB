No amendment liberating for Tymoshenko with Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today refused the request, as part of an amendment to the Penal Code to abolish those paragraphs, have been sentenced on the basis of the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was.
The new regulations, which would have the way to free the imprisoned Expremierministerin can pave, rejected the delegates at the second reading of the request for mitigation of punishment for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was sentenced in October for the completion of an alleged adverse treaty with Russia on the purchase of natural gas to seven years in prison.
The verdict is not yet final, in December to the appeal of the convicted are pending before the courts.
Timoshenko himself described the ruling as political revenge of the regime and the West has raised the suspicion of bias, the process of the court.
The application, Section 365, was sentenced on the basis of the Expremierministerin to remove from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 deputies.
226 votes would have been necessary to its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of Libya&#39;s struggle for liberation or rebellion Libyan already knows their losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried at an undisclosed location in the desert, and without him the war is over.
Now just have to define the winner.
As usual it in this region, Islamists win the elections, the only question is which - the moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council is known to customary law of the Shari ʿ a, from which one has even now to God a certain idea.
Libya would become a country without crime, as for theft in short chopping off the hand.
Women also should not forget the thought of emancipation soon, any apostates are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the Company is of mutually warring tribes united in the future from the Koran.
In short - in Libya will rule an order that this country is hardly conceivable, and in particular hardly desirable.
But - our lifestyle is now not even the only objectively and probably not the best fit and would change the Libyans hardly mentioned.
In this sense it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters could ever help the infidel dogs.
May well serve as an excuse just the fact that the air strikes of NATO is not by any General from America, but by God himself were conducted, whose omnipotence after each successful hit was praised.
The winner in Libya? The West is not among them.
We took part only in an exchange of fire, served the interests of Islam and our politicians got rid of the dictator in the person of a political ally, without any benefit that would have entailed.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq we have seen better from a military occupation of Libya.
Thus, the locals are going on a concern - namely, the expulsion of the Crusaders.
Do the oil companies but without the occupation of black gold at a bargain price?
Probably not, and so the West can finally boast of his selflessness when it comes to legal protection of human rights.
If they will not be the Shari ʿ a representative ruin.

The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro, they won 1-0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football team has mastered the most difficult task for the whole season!
Thanks to a good-humored goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent gate of Petr Jiracek they won 1-0 in Montenegro.
With a large dose of luck, the Czech football was able to defend his lead from the luxurious home game and will not fail again at the European Championships.
IHNED.cz followed the rise of play in a detailed report.
A little excitement in the first half and a huge amount of luck in the second.
The Czech team won thanks to the degree of weakness of the home team, a brilliant Cech&#39;s and the hero of the day Jiracek quite happy in Montenegro 1-0 and thus has her ticket for the UEFA Euro redeemed.
Also because of the precise defensive game of the Czech Mannschaftkonnten they put the Montenegrins until the second half under pressure.
The pitch of the game birds were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two huge opportunities.
Also, thanks to an excellent Petr Cech, the Czech team so next year will be involved at the European Championships, is also encouraging that the local football flows to a premium of approximately EUR 200 million.
From the first minutes of play was quite combative football.
Both teams combined long and it was played primarily at the midline.
In the second half was the pressure from the home team and the wide discounts before the penalty was blocked by the Czech defense successfully.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country&#39;s nuclear program.
They formed a living shield.
Several hundred high school students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, she wanted to demonstrate their support for the nuclear program of their country against a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed Tuesday at noon in front of the object and then the United States and Israel announced the death.
A few hundred students at the University of Isfahan in Iran on Tuesday formed a living shield around it to the core technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed.
So they wanted to make known that they are willing to protect their country&#39;s nuclear program, if necessary, to their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) presented recently in its report that Iran had abandoned its efforts to all appearances, not a nuclear weapon long ago.
Even in Israel talks about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon in front of the entrance to the complex and then the United States and Israel announced the death.
In the case of an attack carried out with the intention to put the Iranian nuclear program largely paralyzed, would the Israeli press, from the center in Isfahan, the uranium enrichment plant in Natanz target.
The menu is an obese child: It is not breakfast for dinner and eats meat
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have a weight problem, where 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of children are overweight.
Recent surveys proved - Obese children often come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
It shows once again how important for the healthy development of a human being is the milieu in which he grows up, and the examples are that surround it.
On the tables of obese children sausages are up to half of the table more often than in families living in those of normal weight children.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had the day before the awareness campaign under the slogan &quot;Obesity is not a coincidence,&quot; French fries for dinner.
In families with Fatty and sports is not one of the favorite pastimes, which also affects the majority of today&#39;s students - only 15 percent answered that their parents at least once in the week, time of active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted last year by the end of the school year, while nearly 900 children were interviewed from elementary schools in the Czech Republic.
That was the second year of the Action &quot;Obesity is not a coincidence&quot;, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
Previously participated in the project more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8 Some classes.
Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the alarming increase in the number of children who are overweight or even obese.
&quot;Only half the children surveyed cited, for example, five times a day, breakfast-mode second breakfast-lunch-snack-food dinner - one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet&quot;, is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relatively minor, such as the regular breakfast time, the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic have breakfast but only 23 percent of the families of the students.
And - in most families, breakfast each by itself.
Worst of all was the finding that breakfast is not at every tenth family.
The breakfast is regarded as the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey test brought to light, among other things, that in families of obese children consumed more often unhealthy fries.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight again - drinking sweet sodas each day (70 percent)
While driving more than 40 percent of the children&#39;s sports, but only less than half of their parents do - namely, only 15 percent.
Imagine your own menu together
Another part of the survey made it possible for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to put together out of options offered by their own appetite and think diet.
&quot;What do prefer Czech children aged between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite foods were many desserts, meat dishes and of course desserts.
&quot;It is alarming, especially the huge popularity of sweet lemonade,&quot; is emphasized in the final report of this survey.
At lunch, which is the main dish, pasta won just ahead of poultry.
Legumes liked the children and hardly even the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Turning toward the health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are willing to change their eating habits when they get correct information.
&quot;In the control group of survey participants, the questionnaire after the enlightening lecture&quot; Obesity is not a coincidence, &quot;filled out, was in many cases, a clear shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition,&quot; noted in the results of the project mentioned.
What is striking, this was the case with the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children crossed the questionnaire also much more than poultry or fish main course of the day and were willing to eat less food or sweet dumplings.
Professionals say - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how to get stylists, I had a bit of grumbling that it was a bit too much material to start with.
Since I had no idea at all what is to come.
Presentations by three professionals from the industry, the apparel problematic characters and a seminar on how the &quot;on the square&quot; is running.
It will get worse.
The closer the test, the more information and practical tasks ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, he is still full.
This time we had a debate with director Alena (the course takes part, not a single man), how to dress a woman who has no ideal proportioned figure.
And after all, most of us.
Some people have too short a neck, the others are too boyish figure without proper curves and some chubby.
It is for the stylists to cover up broad shoulders visually to extend the neck or conjure the necessary curves.
We were also given tips on how to make a woman like Jennifer Lopez type - ie large breasts, wide hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure-hugging attracts, without being too provocative acts.
If so great as the difference between waist and hips, the skirt or the pants do not really fit, you should at least have a piece of tailor-made.
This one will not regret it, because well-fitting clothes is simply priceless.
In such a tailored skirt makes you feel that is much better than in an off the shelf, the high and constantly slipped, protruding into the waist, etc.
Boyish figures can get away again, to wear clothing with folds, bulking, appliqué, embroidery, or gathering.
With this amount of information and character types, I&#39;m glad I have time for a whole week, I leave everything to thoroughly go through your head.
And yet I am afraid that it is applied in view of the homework is not to create almost.
Each of the students got a celebrity that is assigned to come up with matching outfits for them - day wear and evening wear.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the stars and the corresponding figure type.
I want Miranda Kerr &quot;attract&quot; that you may know from the campaign, Victoria&#39;s Secret.
Inside, I rejoice, because this is for me personally a lot better than, say, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera to dress, which has in recent times probably gained a hundred pounds (okay, that&#39;s a bit excessive), or the young Selena Gomez.
The garments we should cut out from magazines or search the Internet, print, and then graphically edit.
In the &quot;mood board&quot; as the whole result is known, then come to our own personal style and our relationship to graphic design for print.
Indeed, it is very important to think about the graphical side of the styling.
The stylist takes the models that is not only physically, but also designed the so-called product page in the journal (according to specific requirement, for example, trend handbags, coats, etc.).
Of these we told the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But the return on the Sunday.
This means that a stylist have a good overall view must.
The figure was with information on types of stuffed spiced same lecture Saturday by three visitors from the industry:
by Jan Pokorný stylists, fashion designers from Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit this.
And be able schickter stylist with a single piece of clothing in many different ways to work.
The magic word is versatility.
So you can wear as a trench coat over jeans as usual, just like a T-shirt or jacket, you can also wear it on the naked body, to wear high heels and wear it as a dress.
It&#39;s enough to roll up our sleeves and collar or equal to the whole look is very different.
&quot;Play with it,&quot; he said.
Most came to me but the next Council Situated: &quot;First you have to know the rules perfectly.&quot;
&quot;Thou must not until then she hurt her,&quot; said Jacob.
Finally, I realize why we need to cram all these theorems, which can be combined with what and why, even though you might see in fashion magazines often quite different.
Not to mention fashion shows all over.
Thanks to photographer Ben I know now that a stylist have prepared a lot more clothing options must be when he finally photographed.
So you have a fashion story with ten pages (pronounced ten outfits) to be prepared and make up at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing in the photo used in combination with other accessories at times look very different than in reality.
With all this so you have to expect in the design of the outfit.
The image and style, sometimes for half the success that we confirmed, Jan Pokorny.
Because you need spend only a Madonna, not just to watch a brilliant singer, have transformed the image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic is one of the services of a stylist more reserved about.
Even famous people often consider it waste of money for (the main thing is that I bring something, what I look like this is secondary).
And if someone already can be styled by us, then we should expect that he or she imposes on us are likely very different (smaller) size, as he or she needs in reality.
Then you need to google then only to establish with certainty that the tabloid press, writes the appropriate celebrity to have taken off again, or, etc.
Jan and Mario put us on Sunday to the heart, not to believe that a stylist to only focus on fashion and then the outfit &quot;assemble&quot; needs.
In his work he has to communicate, especially with the people he styled and he must be a shrewd psychologist.
People to assess themselves and are without pandering to his opinion.
&quot;If we ordered any manager to sift their wardrobe and to add nice pieces, then we can not dispel all her wardrobe and say - my God, that&#39;s terrible.&quot;
&quot;You have to find at least some commendable things for which we suggest what you can bear it,&quot; says Mario.
He also showed us very specifically what needs to include such a so-called &quot;space bag&quot;.
So that&#39;s a bag that is buttoning at the waist and in which one carries all the necessary Proprietäten with him.
Besides such clear terms, such as scissors, paper rolls for hair removal or safety pins, it also contains such utensils, such as a nylon thread (so that the stylist helps when photographing products, such as handbags and hats off), special clips, which is behind the clothes gathered if it is too large (pins or other terminals are prohibited, so the fabric is not broken) and of course sewing.
We need to listen but not only, but also to try something practical, we learned how to stick to shoes properly.
Even when shooting in the studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the shoe sole, let alone outside.
O we are stuck and stuck ...
With the scissors you can not even touch the shoes, so they were not even damaged.
So you have to really act skillfully.
Mario pleased me by praising my &quot;creation&quot; with no restrictions.
The aforementioned skill is in fact not exactly my forte.
All this was only the fraction of what we heard during the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me - the styling is dedicated to professional level, is not child&#39;s play.
Need for Speed ​​V: &quot;The Run&quot; - the illegal race across America
Review
Originally careless driving is a series of entirely avoidable, amateurish error routine trip to the morning shift.
Although it managed to fulfill the ambitions for the most part, but what good does it matter if no one had obviously want to do a bit more.
Even before he came to the counters, the new sub-awakened with the subtitle &quot;The Run&quot; high expectations.
But he promised that even elderly game series &quot;Need for Speed&quot; move back a little into a new dimension in the playable demo examples, he actually seemed to be not only one of many action-driving games.
We were also curious to know what the fitted passages in which the main protagonist of the car rises and goes away.
But as it is already used with NFS, is ultimately much different than we had expected.
Sure - there are potentially quite decent arcade racing, but overall the game from a few unnecessary errors is diminished, which in this series are more or less been a few years present.
So there are really no more errors, but rather a sign of laziness in principle incomprehensible game developers.
The adventure starts out very well.
First one is introduced into the story, the main character Jack has some problems of a personal nature, the only solution seems to be in an illegal race across America to participate through.
In San Francisco, then on the West Coast, you sit behind the wheel - with the task of being the first to be in New York.
The basic idea involves a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race will be held at a different distance and that the stages take place in different, different enough and interesting environment.
It has not a moment the impression that would offer the same game over again.
Some environments are to be considered still very pretty, although the technical level of video does not extend beyond the earlier parts of the series.
So, nothing earth shattering.
But the journey through the desert, through autumnal landscapes or high up through the snowy landscape more visually pleasing.
Occasionally, atypical elements bring a little variety in the individual race.
In the desert, for example, will be caught in a desert storm, which severely restricts the vision.
In the mountains again you have to watch like hell that you will not be buried by an avalanche.
By the way are pretty well built, the individual race in a row.
Although only a few, but they are.
For a while we tried so to pass the prescribed number of enemies (basically a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the clock), then expect a more personal duel with a single counterparty.
And to that interferes even the police who want to screw up one&#39;s whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack is leaving the car.
It&#39;s more about some interactive animations, where Jack runs away from anyone, and where the player must help him by pushing the right buttons at the right moment.
So, nothing complicated.
Not surprisingly, however, that the game is much less of such passages, as one would expect (well actually only three).
Ultimately, this is the cause rather an advantage, because this element has at least a chance of being boring - it belongs in the context of the foregoing, the elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model walks in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, seen from today&#39;s point of view, it pulls out but no trees, on the other hand, could not be said, it would be bad.
Those looking for realistic simulations may need to look elsewhere.
But an action-packed racing the local drive model will continue to meet pretty well, although you might find the competition better.
Until then, if everything is fine.
Real problems emerge only after some time.
In contrast to the driving model is the collision model is not quite OK
Is a game of this kind can hardly be expected that it calculates complex deformations and collisions, but if you are practically no impact on any object idea how the car handles, then obviously not all right.
Case in point: When overtaking or passing close to oncoming cars, &quot;touches&quot; to the other cars in some places only slightly, in others, almost identical situation to get there but skidded and turned wild pirouettes.
Or drive the cart to the same crap.
Thanks to restart the system but does nothing further from it&#39;s definitely annoying.
The restarts are solved: if you have a total loss, or far away lands of the track, then looks back at the game the last clue of the route.
But - in every race you have only five restarts.
If you have exhausted it, everything goes all over again ..
The restarts are therefore more like a tool in the event that something does not succeed, but if you prefer not rely on it.
Sometimes helps but not even the restart, there&#39;s no alternative but to learn the critical section from the head.
Extremely unpleasant, that is the same thing happens often in the same places.
Some curves have to pass through, for example, in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit.
Elsewhere, one encounters in the appropriate place &quot;civilian&quot; cars always in the same configuration, regardless of whether it later as the first or fifth, formerly five seconds or a minute is.
This is annoying, especially in situations when one sees that the opponent&#39;s play before a two oncoming cars pass by, but even there until you arrive, the car has been in a position such that they avoid or slow down.
And it does not matter when you get there, everything that is designed so that it comes close to this situation, always at your fingertips.
The opponents are even more advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you will always be overtaken in the same place the same opponents again and again regardless of the time.
On the craziest this is the end of the game on the long bridge that you pass in the opposite direction.
The counterparty must have a pass here, obviously hell-bent on.
And then if he is ever before you, then he takes a course, the point of view, so that there initial runs his own car a few times to smithereens.
Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and thrilling but this intention is so clear that it spoils the pleasure of a fast game.
And that&#39;s a shame, because despite a simpler model is driving the overall game quite entertaining and action-packed places so that you almost do not know where one is the head.
And basically do not care what &quot;responsible&quot; thing is - the concept of fifty unique routes, the location of the race in a way that can never get bored, or something completely different ...
An unusual idea is also to change cars during the race.
One must not overlook the gas stations along the route, since this is where you can change the car, although sufficient in most cases, the car that you currently have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the large American sedans for the straight highways and super-exotic sports car for the technical tours, for example, on the switchbacks in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game&#39;s story mode, and the tasks (challenges) - so the race in the individual localities, which are known from history.
There are not only medals, but also experience points for your own profile to gain that is common for the problems (challenges) and the story.
To reach the higher level driver, must be open to different objects: the car started right up to the backgrounds for your profile.
This is the same with the online feature Autolog, which compares with others their own results obtained with those of other players and also provides other collective functions.
One of the more incomprehensible blunders is a situation in the last race in history.
This one comes with the car that is in a subway tunnel (I care), where in the dark on the rails long races (I care).
Look at the speedometer digits between 150 a 200 km / h (because of me), but there comes suddenly from behind a subway and an uncompromising drive to scrap.
In our editorial we will probably argue for a long time about whether it was a blackout of the game designers or whether we keep the writers for that stupid.
The technical side is not overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is, in most cases quite appealing, and here and there, even brilliant.
Even more upsetting is that slow for some exciting moments, the refresh rate is and this sometimes quite dramatically.
This applies, however, especially the large number of accidents with Involve, where a continuous FPS benefits anyway.
The sound is far O.K. and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to as wide a scale as possible rather just talk to young audiences, was a soundtrack a la &quot;bit of everything&quot; - but who buys such a game because of the music?
The overall impression of Need For Speed: The Run? The feelings are mixed.
If the game would not be diminished by the totally unnecessary errors mentioned, we could say with great conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But as the game seems somehow unfinished.
For a great pleasure, but you should be prepared that this a bug bite with the power of airport lights in the eyes.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation of negativists and Euro-skeptics
&quot;The Treaty of Lisbon the balance among the different institutions has brought tangible out of kilter.&quot;
I would not expect such a tough war breaks out. &quot;
&quot;It will take five or six years, until things have calmed down and all of their new role will have become accustomed,&quot; Milena began Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, its pretty sharp lecture at the Law Faculty.
How serious it&#39;s motto &quot;of course, open to Europe &#39;takes, they showed in the first part of her presentation in which she succeeded in the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a clear and understandable way to describe that they many a lecturer at the Law Faculty of Charles University would envy you.
Mrs. Vicenová while also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
&quot;At first, been criticized, he was too discreet - a gray civil servant who is not such a role has grown, but I must say, it has all the cunning breathing, as well as he has taken up the cause.
&quot;He is a man who contrives to listen to twenty-seven Member States patient to communicate with them and has the particularly clear idea of ​​how it should proceed with the EU.
The new position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then she explained in answer to the question: What is God - the European Union? What number should I call? &quot;That is an important step towards unification and readability of the EU&#39;s policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to forbid us our Ölmützer Quargel
Mrs. Vicenová also devoted himself to the agenda, according to the European Union, lived, lives and intends to live in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago she described as a success.
The Czechs had weathered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosts the summit for Eastern Partnership.
The case of the government during the presidency called them big negative factor, the image of the Czech Republic have greatly harmed.
The Czech representative in the EU has to do with full hands.
In the words of the ambassador, it was not just the presidency but also the subsequent crisis that has yet to overcome to this day, quite too hectic.
And there has yet to seven-year EU budget be approved, which makes the whole thing just because of today&#39;s economic situation more complicated.
Whether it&#39;s a budget is lean and economical, which sectors get priority in which countries and which are promoted less more - all of that is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also reminded of their own slogans, with whom she came to Brussels: &quot;Europe course&quot;.
&quot;If I do not like something, then there are grayish abbreviation, foreign words and technical jargon that nobody understands.
How should I as a citizen really know whether you conceives in Brussels really crooked or curved cucumbers and bananas of different sizes, or whether we actually want to ban someone the cake of cheese.
It would have the bottom of the EU also used to like to get more Czechs in European Institutions.
Europe of two different speeds or in prospect
In the EU&#39;s ambassador to the Czechs have a reputation of being Euro-skeptics, the more negative, perceive as the positive aspects of the matter.
More annoying is the poor representation of Czechs in European Institutions.
Because many factors are to blame, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write Motivierungsbriefe and last but not least, the weak support for the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, they also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
&quot;Believe me, when a Pole or a Hungarian and a Slovak comes to me is near, then the Frenchman next to me says,&quot; Hey, what you put there heads together - this is again your V4 &quot;and it makes? a rather sour face.
According to Mrs. Vicenové the EU expected in the future especially tough rules for the budget policies of the Member States.
As a lot of real, as a &quot;European Federation&quot; she sees the concept of a Europe of two or even at different speeds.
&quot;We have the euro-zone countries and countries outside the euro zone.
&quot;We the Schengen area and we have already strengthened the institution of cooperation have.&quot;
&quot;For the first time was told that only the countries should work together, who want and those who do not want to quietly stand aside.&quot;
&quot;There will be more and more of such institutions, which in the end to a strong&quot; multi-speed Europe &quot;boils&quot;, expected Vicenová woman.
In this respect, they also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle according to which all issues must be discussed with implications on the entire EU by all Member States, not only from the countries of the euro zone.
Brand story:
The innovator IBM enters into its second century of its existence
If you wanted to find a suitable word that the strategy of IBM characterizes most accurate, then this would be the word &quot;longevity&quot;.
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, we know it as a modern company, although since it was founded a century has passed already.
The basis for this longevity was considering her first boss - ing the visionary Thomas J. Watson.
He already took the slogan, countless global problems could be easily solved if people would be willing to think a bit.
His slogan &quot;Think!&quot; became the hallmark for this should happen, the future life of the giants (and also the title of the company&#39;s internal magazine, which began to be published at IBM in the year 1935).
This was also the basis of carefully prepared Watsen corporate culture.
&quot;For us, of IBM, this means long-term thinking is a kontinuelle movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was so successful a century, because it has remained true to his principles and does not shy away from changing everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform the course of our first century, technology, business and society.
We hope that we create in the next hundred years or more, &quot;said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the Company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Sophisticated system
Watson operational as early as the thirties social care of its employees - in a similar way as the entrepreneur Bata in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people were among the first American employees paid leave to take out insurance by the contractor plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and a elaborate system of pay for the best innovators and distributors.
Equally ingenious are the long-term relationships with their customers by IBM.
The company was brilliant from the start in the talent - picked as one of the first companies worldwide to IBM any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, the Palmisan on top of IBM in the next year is alternated by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
That&#39;s it for thirty years at IBM, so far they took the position of Sales-and marketing and strategy chief.
IBM makes in recent years so-called on-line brainstorming session from which many future strategies and innovations arise.
No wonder - there are plenty of ideas, so the company is nearly half a million people employed.
An institution with good reputation
Their unshakable position in the business guarantees the company a strong image and this inward and outward.
&quot;From the beginning, IBM had more the concept of an institution than a mere technology company,&quot; said the Economist, Harvard Business School professor and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
&quot;IBM is not a technology company to solve, but a company that helps business problems using technology,&quot; added George Colony of Forrester Research consulting firm.
As the company has stressed, there is a difference in the market only to be present or to mold him through this presence directly.
IBM - in the States because of its logo familiar &quot;Big Blue&quot;, is grown in a century to one of the largest companies in the world.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM develops hardware and software infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product breadth - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all the U.S. technology company IBM has the most patents and has five of his employees were awarded the Nobel Prize.
Among his most famous inventions, for example ATMs, credit cards, Finanzswap, bar code, or the floppy disk.
With approximately $ 220 billion market capitalization (market capitalization) this year, IBM was the second-largest technology company (just after Apple), and it the first time since 1996, Microsoft overhauled.
A look ahead
Not all products and innovations to meet the tastes of the customers of today - were unhappy as the experiment with the native operating system OS / 2, the Prodigy online service, or the computer IBM PC Jr.
&quot;Business is based on the forward motion, so you can not be emotional tie to the past&quot;, stated Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem, its foundations built on different platforms - and if they do not work, they leave again.
Unlike the Microsoft counterpart, which is in principle with its Windows operating system and falls.
Promising technologies
In the benefits of IBM participate in the greatest extent in services, software and hardware involved in each case to one-fifth.
This hardware in 1990 with a more than fifty prozentigem share was the most numerous.
Since 2000, IBM sold little profit abwerfende assets worth 15 billion dollars in the same time, however, it invested $ 58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
IBM moves into these investments continue even after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept for the first time such a tempest over the world.
IBM, too, did the legacy of his first boss, Thomas J. Watson faithful, who rose in the middle of the Great Depression its investment scope.
So far it seems that the company IBM is today&#39;s crisis unscathed.
The value of IBM shares rose since 2008 skyrocketed by 120 percent and net profit of the company grows kontinuell.
The company slogan IBM is: everything can change - not just the values.
Even so it is hoped that this flexible giant masters, the next crisis.
IBM&#39;s history: From cheese cutter to Weltallflügen
The one hundred years ago in New York, founded company IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
IBM took over the name until 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for later company IBM put the merger of four companies, whose history in the 80s of the 19th Century back.
They owned technologies such as the famous clocks time cards for the registration of the work beginning and end.
The architect of this new company was Ranlett Charles Flint, who held until 1930, also chairs the board of directors.
And it was Flint who hired the head of rival firm Thomas J. Watson, so this helped him in running the company.
The leader then put even the founder of IBM in the shadow - on Watson&#39;s ideas are based to this day the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM began, as the name implies, with the production and distribution of all kinds of machinery for the trade - of sausages and cheese cutters, to cash.
In the first four decades in which Watson headed the company, he doubled its sales over nine million dollars and the company expanded gradually to all continents.
Watson was responsible for the company so indispensable that he whole forty years in the executive chair, sat until he was succeeded by his son, Thomas Watson Junior replaced.
Under his leadership IBM began to develop artificial intelligence work, and also developed the first programming language.
In the 60 years of IBM computer technician and helped NASA to conduct flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn in 1969 and also the famous flight of humans to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer in 1964 with the same family of computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classical computer, the computer determined the standard of that time came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 to the market.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand, however, she bought the part of consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers and grew the company hereby fully and completely into the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM is paying off in the last three years, the concept of &quot;Smarter Planet&quot;.
It embodies the intention to use technology in an intelligent manner in less than previously planned areas, eg also to improve the situation in transport and urban management.
In the commercial sector, IBM recently introduced the platform &quot;Smarter Commerce&quot;, which is designed to help retailers to manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932, IBM has a branch in the former Czechoslovakia - as ever the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM operates CR including a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe based in Prague, and here there is also a top world-class research team that deals with the technology of voice recognition.
Darina on her unfaithful husband Rychtářová:
Iveta - that ass you can keep you, I no longer want!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it&#39;s over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtář (53) from protectors of Iveta Bartosova (45) had become her lover, Darina was still hopeful that Joseph awoke from his dream of pink and comes home.
But now it&#39;s finally over and with the patience for the other life, she has clear rules.
&quot;Joseph can come home, but not more than my partner,&quot; said D. Rychtářová.
As the singer Darina Rychtářová I. Bartosova had offered refuge in her own home, you probably would not even have dreamed of, like going out with her husband.
When Iveta moved back to her urging, after 30 days off and then back to Říčany, Joseph went along with it.
Yes, he even publicly known that he loves her.
Over time, resigned Darina, yes, it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband again - but now they finally gave him the marching orders.
Rychytář do not care who sleeps with his wife
When Iveta Bartosova Rychtář should leave it in the future, he will receive at home is not safe open arms.
&quot;He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to end his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out.&quot;
&quot;Not as a beloved, old stray donkeys, but as a man to whom I have some ties&quot;, said Ms Rychtářová, but she said that she had separated herself from him emotionally, and already there alone on mutual honesty.
The fact that he has locked the back door, Darina, Joseph wears yet with dignity.
&quot;The decision I respect my wife.&quot;
&quot;I stay involved with Iveta, it changes nothing.&quot;
&quot;My wife wants a paper marriage, and I respect that.&quot;
&quot;The company continues to run, I&#39;ll take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I do the shopping.&quot;
&quot;With Darina I talk normally, but we do not share the same bed,&quot; said J. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk.
When Darina want to look for a new love, then he would not stop them.
&quot;We do not sleep together, so I do not care whether she has a boyfriend or whoever that is.
I realize that this is my fault, I&#39;ve fallen in love Iveta and therefore I assume all responsibility.
The worst female vices: How about you?
When the men were to prompt you to name a few typical female vices, then they shake off the cuff, without exception, some prompt.
Ladies, you recognize yourself in one of these lines again, where we have some bad habits can pass in review again, the men let the blood boil in his veins?
Shopping addiction
Accusing them of her husband, to be addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one rag week?
She likes to go shopping and it may also be a bit more in the same actions?
Then it goes in your case probably really a weakness.
Some women are, at least aware of their desire to buy and try to keep reasonably under control.
But honestly, what woman can not stand it already, looking for a well-fitting outerwear is the only way to walk through a clothing store and did not try all the same (in every possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even if shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often the pure hell.
Think they have some, how many times they have already told her husband - you&#39;d better stay out there ...
Permanent discontent
&quot;I am not too fat?&quot;
&quot;I would have to remove at least five pounds - I start to jog or do aerobics?&quot;
&quot;I gradient you at all?&quot;
Them that is somehow familiar?
Yes?
Then you are probably also among the women who are literally obsessed with how they look.
That is by no means that you should let go, but many men are allergic to it, if your wife complains constantly about her appearance.
The stronger sex is in agreement - with an increasing frequency of complaints, the women are always incompatible.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Window cleaning, tile and dust mop, scrub the tub - and this at least twice a week.
Scold her partner, because he once again trampled by dirty shoes on the clean tile, you blame the kids, because that just scoured basin is already dirty and because the glass door on the cupboard again fingerprints has, though even the polish so much trouble doing?
If you are under this kind of &quot;deviance&quot; are suffering, then you should know that we must not exaggerate, and the order and cleanliness in the family life does not come first.
This may ultimately immeasurable Reinheitsfimmel the mutual relations and in particular the harm peace in the family.
Jibe
&quot;Dirty gym shorts come into the laundry basket.&quot;
&quot;Do you want the old socks really tighten again tomorrow?&quot;
&quot;A wet towel does not simply thrown on the floor.&quot;
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, do not be surprised that it brings up the wall.
Clearly this is not meant badly, they want only that everything has its place.
If the men knew this, then the women may not need as much to complain about.
Gossip
Some women like to gossip and gossip, there is whispering behind your back or even slandered or to forge alliances.
Women are now focused on time relationships, so they pant like those issues by, for example - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably every one of us women have a little harmless gossip in stock.
Be honest - that&#39;s probably all women own.
This is not to be confused with gossips worst caliber, where nothing and no one is holy, who despise each well in their environment and especially for women&#39;s collectives that represent a significant threat.
Voracek and Jagr helped Philadelphia with her assistant to victory
The ice hockey forward Jaromir Jagr had the Monday game in the NHL with two assistants large share of the 5-3 victory at Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina, and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
Beneficiaries of the survey of thirty-nine Hockey Stars in both cases was Claude Giroux, who have added an assistant and was proclaimed the best player of the match.
Two assistants also recorded in the same game Jagr&#39;s teammate Jakub Voracek.
Jagr claimed to journalists after the match, he predicts a great evening Giroux.
&quot;Even before the game I told him that he now manages a hat-trick.&quot;
I somehow had the feeling. &quot;
&quot;Every now and then one comes upon such a feeling,&quot; said Jagr, scored according to its action at the first shot Giroux of the Flyers a goal.
A bit later, also had the second hit, &quot;a Czech track.&quot;
Voracek fought behind the gate of the Hurricanes the puck and put it before the successful between the circles Maxim Talbot.
One second before the final whistle of the first third of the home players scored Patrick Dwyer, a short-hander, but the second was one-third again the Flyers.
Specifically Giroux.
In collaboration with Jagr he scored his third goal, after his shot deflected Wayne Simmonds to the fourth gate.
&quot;I love to play with him.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m not saying that he is the best player in the league, but he certainly is one of the top three,&quot; Jagr acknowledged its center.
&quot;I would not have occurred in the life that I play to end my career with such a hockey player together, as with him.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m absolutely delighted.&quot;
&quot;I cut my game to me.&quot;
&quot;All these years in the NHL put my players their game on me and now the tables turn around,&quot; Jagr smiled.
Carolina did not match the drama - the hit of Tuoma Ruutua again and Dwyer, who prevailed in a penalty shot, it came up on a goal.
Matt Read prevented any further complication, however, in which he was successful in over number two against one.
&quot;Excellent Pronger still acted in our zone.&quot;
&quot;He caught the puck, I picked up speed, and (Read) moved to distant posts.&quot;
&quot;I tried to make and I am glad that it worked,&quot; described Voracek the last goal of the game from his perspective.
With this victory, Philadelphia took the lead the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček was injured in the game against Buffalo, and retired in the second trimester because of an injury of the upper body.
The Candiens lost their next pool their experience and leadership in a penalty shoot-not lost 2:3.
Could not convert any of the penalty shots Tomas Plekanec.
More than the lost points were hurting the coach of the home team probably the high sickness absence on the defensive - the game they played with only five defenders to the end.
&quot;This is bad.&quot;
&quot;The meeting we played with only one experienced player at the end, the rest were young players.&quot;
&quot;But there can do nothing, so we must be ready,&quot; said Jacques Martin.
&quot;Every time you change an attacking wave after another and we had nothing to oppose.&quot;
&quot;We could make the game easier and bring the puck out of our third need.&quot;
There were some reserves, &quot;said PK Subban, a defensive player.
Ondrej Pavelec of the Czech goalkeeper fought off thirty shots of Tampa Bay and contributed significantly to a 5-2 victory over Winnipeg.
On the outskirts of the Jets, who had a series of five defeats hereby terminated, five different shooting percentage.
Development in fares since 1989
By 1989 there were only five of the then Czechoslovak government approved travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, and Rekrea Autoturist.
The travel agencies selling trips at that time mainly only in the Socialist bloc countries, were allowed into the West at that time only a selected few.
And that Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - East Germany), in the Soviet Union (Sochi, on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and Hungary at Lake Balaton.
A possible exception was the period from 1962 and 1972, as one could also travel to Yugoslavia, then struck a pro-Western course and Yugoslavia were therefore severely restricted the travel of Yugoslavia.
A great paradox that socialism, was that it was not even citizens of the Eastern bloc (including the Czechoslovaks) allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia, for example, wanted to travel to Poland individually or even in the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called letter of invitation, individual trips were otherwise not possible.
Even back then the travel agent to also travel to the West, but then you had to take into account huge snakes or even in a sleeping bag to stay in front of the travel office, or at least &quot;good friends&quot; in the travel agency have.
Even so, the matter was far from gone.
The so-called foreign exchange commitments - the requirement for an exit to the West - has been given only &quot;politically reliable&quot; people - the others were not traveling at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was freely convertible currency that is not without currency commitments so it would have been impossible for the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West to be found.
The Czechs spent so far away most of their holidays at home, no wonder that the Czechs countless cottages and dachas bought - a practice that continues today.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a trip to the Czech revolution in the foot.
While all things were until 1989 a holiday in East Germany or Bulgaria in the measure, Czechs spent the last year, 4.5 million of its foreign holidays in countries around the world.
An enormous paradox, which one is not aware of anymore is the fact that in the currently most popular tourist destination for Czechs - Croatia until 1989, could not travel at all, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 90s of last century, the motto of duty in the neighboring Western European countries have been lifted, which caused a huge wave of short visits to Vienna in Austria, especially to and from Germany.
The Czechoslovaks were able to get from their long trips to the West just is not enough, everyone wanted at least a couple of days have been there.
Sun slept in the Czech tourists traveling to Paris in a tent in the park, because who would then have the money to stay in a hotel or a guesthouse had.
A typical feature of trips abroad by that time was a Czechs with canned goods, beer and sausage and so fully packed trunk.
Another important milestone was the introduction of freely convertible Czech crown - after decades of Western tourists were our currency finally free shopping.
Our standard of living and thus also the average salaries have risen, which in 1997 einmündete important in another moment.
Due to the increased demands for travel, travel agents began after 1997 to prepare regularly travel by charter flights, making the air travel with the ability to negotiate volume discounts, compared to the past incredibly reduced prices.
End of the 90s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already devise means of payment with all other highly developed countries of the world, which made travel much easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the &quot;post-Velvet&quot; tourist traffic there was in 2000 when it was released due to high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, annual direct charter aircraft to fly with Czech passengers to distant sunny countries and this year we will fly directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations.
There are about 100 thousand Czechs traveling to exotic countries every year!
Another important moment in the era that marked our &quot;post-revolutionary&quot; development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the U.S. lifted its visa requirement for Czech tourists, bringing our country einreihte definitely among the advanced countries of the world.
In 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their first holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent for a single holiday stay at the resort including the cost of more than 15 thousand CZK per head.
The AGM is to find a new chairman - again facing a stalemate.
Almost five months, the Czech football no chairman, while threatening that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the top of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday will be known in Nymburk.
To date, there are in fact still no agreement on what should be elected by electoral rules.
And without absolutely no vote on the three potential successors is possible.
Three potential buyers want to manage the Czech football - Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June joined Hasek back of his function, he urged his colleagues to the resignation had to come together and find a strong personality, which could lead to football in the future.
But - in the era after the old quarrels Hasek broke out again between the two chambers Association, who are unable to agree on a common candidate.
This was demonstrated clearly on 16 September, should be selected as the new chairman.
Delegates at the Annual General Meeting had come for nothing in the National House in Prague&#39;s Smichov district, because the negotiations led to no result, while it was not just about the election itself
One could in fact do not even agree on who in the full collection is actually eligible to vote - only the registered agent or the appointed officials with a power of attorney.
In this single point is scored at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law contributed whose opinion a representation based on power of attorney is not permitted.
The disputes over the election rules, however, take to continue.
Also, the Executive Committee did not bring more clarity to the matter at its meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - basically anything else on the agenda.
Although the views changed with respect to the choice a few times - the nerve center remained the same.
The question is: how will the 3rd Proceed round to avoid a stalemate?
&quot;The issue concerns the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the statute, or whether a different model must be found,&quot; said Dusan Svoboda, one of three vice-chairmen of the FAČR determine who represents management&#39;s professional football.
According to a registered model wins in the third round of the one candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the chamber for which he may run.
Moravia is reportedly ready to respond to the compromise that whoever wins candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech side is again on the condition that the winner gets this percentage vote count at least a two thirds majority.
&quot;Then the two preliminary rounds have absolutely no sense, this mode would make the entire two-chamber concept in question&quot;, of course Svoboda the objections of the Moravian side that it would be best to not bend the electoral rules, but to choose according to the applicable statutes.
Which agrees surprisingly well Tomáš Paclík, even when looming, that the statutory election rules comes from all the candidates most likely to receive well-Pelta.
&quot;My desire is that is chosen largely by the Statutes.&quot;
&quot;This no nonsense replacement variants are invented, such as at the last meeting,&quot; said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzen, candidate for the first time, and in his opinion, mainly against Pelta demarcated.
Pelta but remains optimistic.
In his opinion, is the new chairman in Nymburk be known, and he believes the candidate will work constructively in the future.
&quot;The possibility of qualifying for the national team for the World Championship at the present day would certainly help to calm the minds.&quot;
&quot;If football rides on the first euphoric wave, then the greater willingness to cooperate,&quot; said the official from Pribram, who brings all three of the most experienced and adept at both the professional as well as regional level.
Rajchl there is more reserved.
&quot;I hope to reach an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambiguous.&quot;
&quot;This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts, the provisions for its own purposes&quot; straighten out &quot;.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s why a new block at the meeting is not excluded.&quot;
&quot;But I hope that common sense prevails, ultimately,&quot; said Rajchl.
But - a lot of time on agreement of all sides no longer remains.
Some negotiations were supposed to be played directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the Fußballgeneralität will be up to the qualifier at all complete.
The charter aircraft should fly by, among other things Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl after Podgorice could start in the morning in Prague due to a technical fault did not and so was sought frantically for a replacement version, as one part of the Executive Committee still at the site of the Barrage -first leg to bring.
Ultimately, then surely the crucial meetings at ministerial level at which it is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Josef Dobes, the Minister of Education, Youth and Sports would have divided the parties within the largest sports federation in the country like moving to an agreement.
There is much at stake, namely: government grants, the Vertrauungswürdigkeit of Czech football, and the forthcoming annual general meeting of the ČSTV that will have the Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka new direction.
Paclík goes into battle for the position of the chairman, because he sees no suitable candidates
When Tomas Paclík, head of the Pilsner footballers before the extraordinary general meeting would have a strong candidate to make that all his ideas would have met the new chairman of the Football Association of Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not at all on the battle for the top position admitted.
&quot;If there is a good candidate, then I would fight for him and give up the choice.&quot;
&quot;But in the current situation, it failed to find such an adept,&quot; said Paclík CTK.
The main reason for going Paclík, to duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl, so it&#39;s to prevent the supposed favorites of the election, Pelta, reached the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasizes that if he wins he does the role of the chairman to exercise only one year, ie until 2013, until the date of the Annual General Meeting.
In the position of president he would have liked to see an experienced senior managers who ends up not too much into the football action is.
&quot;With some eligible people I&#39;ve spoken personally.&quot;
&quot;Hard to believe, that give me some said they did not currently identify with the Czech football.
&quot;Such views would have gladly changed,&quot; he cited.
Most disturbing of all Paclík Pelta&#39;s alleged connection with the chairman of the Pilsen District Football Association Berbr novel, a man with a controversial reputation, which is behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence delegates voting at general meetings.
For Paclík it is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta had held the position of chairman.
&quot;With his victory would be the present condition and einkonserviert in Czech football, it would not advance at all.&quot;
&quot;The support from Berbr a clever businessman, the football would get doubly bad,&quot; said Paclík.
By this he alludes to the fact that Pelta&#39;s name was some time ago in connection with phone taps to determine in a corruption scandal, but from the Pelta impunity emerged.
&quot;I do not know what prestige would bring the victory of Pelta (Cz) football.&quot;
&quot;And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,&quot; said řekl Paclík that his earlier statement, &quot;he would sell the football club Pilsner, when will President Pelta,&quot; but already looks more relaxed.
If Paclík win in Thursday&#39;s election, but he could imagine a future collaboration with Pelta well.
Just think also another candidate - Rajchl the Paclík before the AGM in October was supported, which ended in a fiasco.
&quot;He (Pelta) would be the first to go would be to me.&quot;
&quot;He has great skills.&quot;
&quot;I could imagine him as well as head of the national team.&quot;
&quot;But I do not think that he is able to lead the Association as a manager.&quot;
&quot;I am my nose stuck but not in matters of which I know nothing,&quot; said Paclík, who in September, provided that a sensation that he left behind the dismissal of the Referees Committee with Ludek Macela at the top was the Dagmar Damková replaced.
Paclík himself claims that he feels up to the role of the association chairman.
And refers to his skills in the management of private firms, since last summer, he is also chief of Pilsen, which celebrated its support in May, the first triumph in the league.
&quot;I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain culture of this.&quot;
&quot;To limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeal committees, what to degenerate into vile situations,&quot; led to Paclík who makes no secret of his antipathy for example, compared with the Sparta-chief Daniel Kretinsky.
As one of his priorities, he saw to the strengthening of relations between the Czech and FAČR Olympic Committee, with whose help he would be lobbying for political leaders to ensure that more money flows out of the lottery tax in the sport.
&quot;This is one of the key things that should be devoted to the new president.&quot;
&quot;When it comes to the taxation of gambling, such as declaring the political parties, then I understand their argument, they must also say loud and clear where the money goes,&quot; he said.
His connection to the Club Pilsner Paclík also sees not as a handicap, although he himself stresses, the chairman of the FAČR must be &quot;bipartisan&quot;.
Pelta is in turn connected to Pribram, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
&quot;This is not ideal.&quot;
&quot;I think it makes sense but not much, my shares in the club transferred to Pilsner hypocritical to a third person in order to return a half years,&quot; explained Paclík.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which would exclude a stalemate in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates pledged to the president office, namely Miroslav Pelta, he&#39;ll do in the event of his election to an extent that the FAČR gets new statutes that preclude future disputes over the election rules from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before Thursday&#39;s hearing Nymburk and believes the campaign will be safely defuse a potential success of the Czech variety.
Pelta had promised before the election in September is not realized that he wanted to focus on if elected to the national team and the recovery of funds.
He decided until the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting, and so he liked the two-month break to help to defend his ideas on the management of football and to present in a broader context.
&quot;People at all levels devote himself to football, they are impatient and expect that the president is announced on Thursday.&quot;
&quot;He feels that it is high time that the association is led by someone who thinks the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, but also acted for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee.
That&#39;s why he says that he has sufficient experience to lead the Czech team.
He is convinced that responsible for the current problems with the election euphoria that prevailed in the days of Ivan Hasek.
&quot;Unfortunately, at the Annual General Meeting in June approved statutes that were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they did not allow different interpretations, we have already had a chairman in September, &quot;said Pelta.
Just a review of the most important document of the civil association he used as bait for the delegates.
&quot;I should be president, then I guess its me personally and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it does not work.&quot;
&quot;This is a matter of principle, without which he can not,&quot; says Pelta.
In addition, he is not trying to distance themselves against his opponent.
Earlier he had announced he would enter into a collaboration with Jindrich Rajchl imagine that he recognizes because of his legal training and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
Tomáš Paclík he took a long time to no more, which in turn was not a dry thread on Pelta.
In football, he moves more than a year and can already point to some successes. &quot;
&quot;His attacks were, however, disparaging, and many people were shocked by his campaign.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s why many now doubt of his real character,&quot; Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remains true to its Proklamierungen that he has already commented in September.
In his opinion, is his strongest weapon, the knowledge of football from the lower leagues, to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
&quot;I would also seek to end all love affairs - the Cause of Bohemians, to the reverberations of the corruption scandal last year.&quot;
&quot;Right after that I would throw myself on negotiations with the private and public sectors to ensure adequate funding for all the football,&quot; the forty-six candidates CTK said two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his collection would mean to the tip of the Czech football no personnel purges.
&quot;I&#39;d have to work first with the content of all employees become familiar,&quot; he said in the direction of Strahov, where due to the long anarchy understandably nervous.
Despite the catastrophic scenarios dezeitigen that accompany the forthcoming annual general meeting, he believes that the delegates on Thursday not go in vain to Nymburk.
&quot;If really the only point at issue should be how to vote in the third round, then we get over it.&quot;
&quot;Football needs credibility and the only way he wins back when he finally has a new leader,&quot; Pelta is two days before the potentially decisive day of his official career with optimism.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR begins to work hard at it
If the former deputy chairman Jindrich Rajchl at the AGM on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic should be elected, this would apparently many people spoil the mood in the dressing.
Rajchl promises, namely, that we start to work hard if elected.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for some soccer fields.
He also promised to resolve the case Bohemians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA to bring more money into football and otherwise to continue the work that has begun the previous chairman Ivan Hasek.
&quot;As chairman I would like to devote myself to football as a whole.&quot;
Starting from the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, the national team, professional football, through to competitive soccer for the youth. &quot;
&quot;So I will not say that I want to do everything alone,&quot; said in an interview for CTK Rajchl.
&quot;I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the powers of the Executive Committee so that each member of a certain area is devoted.&quot;
And I will distribute hard task, so the football is progressing in each segment with mileage increments. &quot;
It would be a lot not just delighted, because they, rather than to criticize the work of others, now work really hard to even begin would, &quot;he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement was considered to no longer run.
&quot;From my knowledge, I work 20 hours a day.&quot;
&quot;But I must know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, throwing me not constantly stick between his legs, and every step I take, calling into question,&quot; he said as an explanation of why he was hesitant.
&quot;Many people told me but that I should not give up, because it would do for other things also.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s trust that we must not lose,&quot; he said.
Supposedly it also motivated to be able to continue the work he has begun to Hasek.
&quot;In two years we have dealt with a great work and I do not want to throw away now.&quot;
&quot;The processes have been started which will probably only in a few years into its own and I would not like to see that they stop someone,&quot; he said, does hereby express its concern that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the days before Hasek.
&quot;I believe in the systematic approach and is something that Mirek Pelta not cut it.&quot;
&quot;Behind him, above all people that would make the football so that he would be there only for the elect.&quot;
I can probably blame Some, but not that I&#39;m biased. &quot;
&quot;I try to be objective.&quot;
&quot;I want football for all, because then it all goes well and not just the chosen ones,&quot; said Rajchl.
He also rejects the claim that he was only a chairman of the Czechs.
&quot;Although some people say otherwise, I really going to do what is best for Moravia.&quot;
&quot;For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and Moravian part, then ascended the winners in each of the first division.&quot;
&quot;Then could not it happen that now play only three Moravian clubs in the league, which is a problem particularly for the young players in Moravia,&quot; says Rajchl.
Because it has now also joined the chief of the Pilsen club Tomas Paclík the battle for the role of the chairman, dares not Rajchl to assess his chances that he will chosen.
&quot;I have a strong support feel in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me to vice chairman and now recognizes the need for clear successes are behind me,&quot; led to Rajchl, which includes the savings of tens of millions of crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and negotiations for the lottery law as regards its success.
On the other hand, he is partly to blame, that the association does not take a single strand.
As he says of Pelta, &quot;he was disqualified from the outset to help the Czech football to a new trust,&quot; he holds the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate who really have something to offer football.
&quot;No one can question that he has done in just one year in Pilsen excellent job.&quot;
&quot;Should he be elected, he would probably continue the things that has taken Ivan Hasek and the staffing of the commissions he would obviously not change fundamentally.&quot;
He would certainly not want hinbiegen things in his favor, &quot;says Rajchl over his rivals.
Europe&#39;s most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Paddling in UFO appearance, ceremonial pools in Budapest: When traveling through Europe can meet a big surprise - and relax after a city tour or a hike in the tired legs, bubble baths.
One book shows where wellness is in the water at its best.
When Iris Meder in the past year and a half went on research trip, one could not fail in their luggage: her swimsuit.
Ling lying back on the water, she looked up into artfully designed domes, marble cherubs they swam towards the edge of the pool waiting for her, and marveled at meticulously restored art nouveau swimming pools.
Liked her a bath, she took it at once in her notebook on - including interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architectural historian Meder in this way - and it is now in her recently published book &quot;Bathing&quot; in front: public swimming pools in Munich, historic palaces, bathing in the Black Forest, &quot;hard-core concrete structures&quot; in the Taunus.
By 13 countries, she led her &quot;journey to the extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe&quot;: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, they visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city in Luxembourg , Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
With sports, they did not care much, says Medes - only the water that was different.
Just annoying that fans have come to terms with floating blue tiles and chlorine smell, and joggers can inhale the heady scent of pine forests, or listen to cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
&quot;I was one day asked why swimming pools actually have to always be so ugly,&quot; said Meder, who lives in Vienna.
&quot;So I started to collect beautiful bathrooms.&quot;
Water surface architecture doubles
Splashing in the diving pool and sauna, essential oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so great because all the senses are controlled, the Medes.
And when the builders have taken pains to swimming pools to be a true feast for the eyes: &quot;Instead of a floor in a bathroom you have a water surface.&quot;
&quot;It is both transparent and reflects the other hand, reflects the beauty of the whole building.&quot;
Everything is doubled optical: high arched, colorful tiles, stepping stones.
The small-format picture book &quot;Bathing&quot; provides 190 pages of facts about the architecture and cultural history, historic oases - but most of all desire to make a leap into the blue.
Notable examples discovered the pool collector Meder for her research in Hungary.
In addition to sumptuous spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Baths in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in an alpine karst cave (cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal spa, the pool with alkalihaltigem water are filled up in a bottle-shaped building houses (Városi Termálfürdö Jászberény).
Spectacular views, however, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: While the Zurich roof bath all the city has in mind, you can look in the outdoor pool, a spa in St. Anton on the snowy Arlberg - and: In the steam room there is a window from which one can observe the activity on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary design pool awaits swimmers at length field: The Aqua Dome Ötztal just looks like a UFO landed in the Alps.
Three open-top trays are concentrated in winter, while in the background rise the mountains of the Ötztal in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool collector of the Medes rose odor of chlorine into the nose.
Many spas smell of sulfur in the bath in the Hungarian Árpád Bekescsaba it stinks so strongly of oil, which is hard to believe, to be landed in a health spa.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogenkarbonathaltigen healing water that is almost black and its a mud stuck to the skin as soon as you let yourself slip into the pool - a special kind of spa experience
Iris Meder was in a place in their search for great swimming holes, however, disappointed as they wanted to visit the open air and sun bath in the Czech Luhatschowitz, they found a cordoned terrain.
In 1902 by architect Dusan Jurkovic designed bathroom has now been closed.
As the Medes a look through the windows of the weathered red, white and yellow art nouveau building, threw it looked like overgrown weeds between the tiles.
Has countered the decline in contrast to a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases have already been through this bath, you can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements derived from the time of its establishment in 1844, but also a Moorish Alhambra Hall in style, which was added in 1900.
Since 1995, the palace of careful modernization is the favorite resort of the thermal pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not just because she is originally from the Black Forest.
&quot;It is quite an accomplishment to meld so many different styles to such a great unit,&quot; says Meder.
With such a palace of the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural speculation
German bank can illuminate commodity business
By Christian Teevs
Is the German bank on their business in agricultural commodities?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the effects of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the CEO wants to draw the conclusions.
Hamburg -
For the Germans, the matter is clear: in 84 percent of Germans, according to a study is not acceptable for banks to speculate in agricultural commodities such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of respondents did require that off the German bank and other financial institutions from this business, because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa opinion poll commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report, presented in mid-October the Food Watch.
In it, Harald Schumann, the author shows that the bets on global commodity exchanges to drive up prices - and the banks therefore bear the blame on global hunger problem.
The campaign is aimed specifically consumer protection against German Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, although major banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley to act similarly.
Originally commodity bets were intended to protect dealers against price fluctuations.
But now, most experts are agreed that the gambler is decoupled from supply and demand have - and make profits at the expense of the poor.
Unlike U.S. rival Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to look into the allegations and said that no business be it &quot;well worth adding to the reputation of the German bank at risk.&quot;
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an International Working Group is examining the allegations in the Food Watch report.
By the end of the year, the examination to be completed, then the results of the management board of Deutsche Bank will be presented - along with recommendation on how to handle it.
The end of January will notify the head of the bank then the action it takes.
In the end, could be a reduction of the raw materials business, or even the complete abandonment.
Ackerman is working on its image
Foodwatch head Thilo Bode, welcomed the news, but also reiterated his criticism of the financial sector: &quot;The betting on rising prices of food shows very dramatically, as banks recklessly injure the common good today.&quot;
Ackerman is a top banking lobbyist now a special responsibility.
&quot;The German bank has to remove all equipment from its portfolio, bets where money is used on food prices,&quot; said Bode.
&quot;Whether Mr. Ackermann to starving people, or to the reputation of Deutsche Bank does.&quot;
The insight comes from Ackermann at first sight surprising, but it is clear that the CEO would like to make a few months before his departure from office a perfect picture.
On Monday, the German bank announced that the CEO will not go exactly as planned to the board.
With a shift away from the controversial agricultural speculation he could improve his image.
And he needs to potential losses is hard to shave - so that eventually his successor would have to do.
Second Commodity Systems Everyone would terminate
Food Watch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager up.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users in the campaign, the organization took part.
On Tuesday Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute on 7 and 8 November 1001 people surveyed.
Just eleven percent regard it as legitimate for the German bank offers facilities which will be placed on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences when they learn that their bank involved in such transactions: Every second person would announce the survey to all systems in which money flows into commodity speculation.
43 percent would discourage friends from such a bank, 49 percent said they think about it, to terminate your account and go to another institution.
21er Haus, Vienna
The relocated pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history of ups, downs and a happy ending: The Austrian pavilion of Expo Brussels in 1958 was won prizes in Vienna to the museum, stood empty and degenerated.
Now he is re-opened as an exhibition venue.
When swarmed by modern post-war architecture is of clear shapes, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials, which are typical of the faith in technological progress, then the Austrian pavilion by architect Karl Schwarzer for the Brussels World Fair 1958, a striking and famous example .
Schwanzer pavilion was then the Grand Prix d&#39;Architecture for his light and floating-looking steel and glass construction.
The building is still regarded as a landmark of contemporary architecture.
He was the architect so well known that the built up at the next World&#39;s Fair Pavilion in Austria.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder engine house plus outbuilding schüsselartigem in Munich in 1973 he finally internationally famous.
His planned as a temporary exhibition building pavilion was erected on one of the world exhibition in the Swiss Garden in Vienna South Station, and in 1962 converted to a museum of the 20th Century opened - the &quot;20&#39;s House&quot; it was called.
Suitable, the building was neither physically and technically as a museum - no walls to hang the art, not a good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001 the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now, the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, he is now called &quot;21&#39;s House&quot; and is used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday night opened the Belvedere museum, which includes the house, where the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in all respects.
Enforced new beginning Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director in 2007, the Austrian Gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, Ph.D., art historian with a remarkable career including in youth as Eiskunstläufererin later at Sotheby&#39;s, the Guggenheim Museum and a founding director of the Museum of Modern Art Salzburg, rebuilding began strongly by politicians and preservationists, they procured public funding and private sponsorship and set usage.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba foundation of the same are issued, a café and a bookshop there should be, and an office building had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the implementation Krischanitz then was the ideal candidate.
Not only because he had converted Joseph Olbrich&#39;s Secession in Vienna and sensitively extended and won the competition, but because he has studied at the Technical University of Vienna Schwanzer and the pavilion for him a &quot;tremendously important place&quot; was where he &quot; almost every weekend, &quot;the exhibition was viewed.
He knew the original draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost when they move to Vienna and its conversion to generosity and lightness.
With the current renovation it was much bigger problems: the building was &quot;a centrifugal energy,&quot; says Krischanitz.
The profiles of the window glass facade were replaced, used fiberglass reinforced insulation, replacing the glass roof by special safety glass.
Cold steel girder bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been restored.
Two basements took place for the new use, a sunken trench between the house and street lighting provides the illumination, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors are still there, the house is in old red-brown rust-color painted.
And the cinema is even exactly the way it was before.
And all under the strict supervision of the heritage authority and with a small budget.
&quot;Often, a material had to be found, which is good and is cheap and well liked by the Archaeological Service,&quot; says Krischanitz and indicates a rough floor in the basement.
Despite the constraints, problems and modifications, the building has remained flexible and easy.
Difficult it was to the Pavilion, &quot;was coming along from Brussels,&quot; has Krischanitz said recently that a typical &quot;drop-in-the-city story.&quot;
Such an architecture was &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and would still &quot;give a true consciousness.&quot;
In this case, the 21er house is not in the wrong place, because it has occurred, an urban design opportunity: To the Swiss garden precisely formed around the newly proposed &quot;Station Quarter&quot;, with office and residential buildings.
And another stroke of luck will probably occur even more: The 21&#39;s house could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz-building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg, the Berlin Temporary bought art gallery, and we hear they been negotiating with the city for a neighborhood location the Swiss Garden.
Railway plans to winter-crisis package worth millions
The railway has devised a crisis plan to prevent the cancellations in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the battle against winter-related cancellations and delays, the German railway is a newspaper report that this year also from over 70 million €.
The &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper reported, citing a prior intercompany crisis plan, by 2015, investments of around 300 million euros.
This should improve the availability of vehicles and rail network can be achieved even in extreme weather conditions.
The plan was to include a doubling of the internal and external staff for snow removal on railway lines and platforms to 16,000 people.
The goal is to train platforms to the start of operation and 90 percent of mission-critical switch to free within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, car chief Ruediger Grube had after a summit meeting with government and industry from cancellations and delays, warned again this winter.
Last winter, the train passenger had serious problems, since it lacks, among other things in difficult weather conditions on reserves.
Significant new regional trains have been waiting for years for an approval from the Federal Railway Authority.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
The track is very difficult for even for years that they consider axles of ICE trains more often in the workshop can be after an ICE had at Cologne Main Station a broken axle.
German bank pays millions of punishment in the U.S.
After the tumult of new CEO Josef Ackermann trouble comes from the USA: The German bank has to pay there a Millionenbuße.
As if the problems would be at home for the German bank is not enough, the industry giant picks now even his past in the United States: The Frankfurt Institute will pay in a settlement $ 145 million (106 million €) to disputes due to a bankruptcy five enclose large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It&#39;s about the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of major banks, have led to the co-operative banks with false promises to buy the financial products they have downplayed the risks.
Such documents lost during the financial crisis firmly on value and the banks pulled into the depths.
&quot;We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue, without the parties had to go to court,&quot; a German bank spokesman said in New York.
The bank admitted no fault with the comparison.
This is also true for Citigroup, which has committed itself to pay 20.5 million dollars.
The NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the cooperation of the two financial houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions, and a jump in bankruptcies in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA attempts to replace the resulting multi-billion dollar losses to get.
The comparisons are now closed, the first of its kind
The regulator had also cut other banks and be sued in the summer of JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Acting for mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the burst U.S. housing bubble in 2007, this has been a large number of financial companies to doom.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis that toppled the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers.
Even though the events may have taken a few years, the banks are currently facing in the United States against a sharp wind.
Investors and regulators have filed countless lawsuits to obtain compensation or to punish misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has initiated the largest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 major international banks, the two state U.S. housing finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for mortgage transactions worth roughly $ 200 billion have taken advantage of.
The German bank has to face a complaint by the FHFA, this is about more transactions totaling $ 14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurt stand up for &quot;substantial losses&quot;, but does not mention an exact amount.
The German bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and declared they would defend themselves.
Warren Buffett enters with 10 billion at IBM
Financial guru Buffett invested heavily in IT company IBM.
Since March he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always said, not in IT and computer companies to invest, because the long-term development of the company let predict poorly.
Now, however, he had read the annual reports from IBM and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier, that IBM offering particular services and Acquire Computer Systems for IT departments of other companies.
An investment from Warren Buffett is considered to be knighted in the financial world.
Consequently, the IT veteran IBM may now call &quot;IBM sir.&quot;
Because Buffett revealed now in the U.S. business channel CNBC that he had bought in March IBM shares worth 10.7 billion dollars.
His investment company Berkshire Hathaway is to become one of the largest shareholders of IBM, with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM had previously known something of the commitment.
He praised the management, which itself had caused the economic crisis to good profits.
&quot;They did a great job,&quot; said Buffett&#39;s strategy.
IBM has been using for quite some time on the lucrative IT services such as data center operations.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting firms, and powerful computers.
Buffett avoided technology companies tend to date.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands well.
Instead, Buffett took on a freight train at about, a lubricant manufacturer, or mechanical engineers.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns next to some 80 subsidiaries also own shares in a number of major corporations such as Coca-Cola and the Munich Re, Munich Re&#39;s earlier.
The 81-year-old had taken in the 1960s, a small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway and expanded it with wise investment into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Nevertheless, his modest lifestyle.
It is, therefore, for countless investors around the world, a cult figure.
His almost unfailing sense of making money he has been nicknamed the &quot;Oracle of Omaha&quot; is introduced.
After the announcement of Buffett investment, IBM shares rose by one percent premarket.
&quot;Big Blue&quot;, as IBM is known, is in the stock market a total of more than 220 billion dollars and is connected with Apple, and Microsoft&#39;s most valuable technology company in the world.
At Microsoft, they said Buffett, but he would not enter.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the &quot;Zwickau cell&quot; Turkish media questioned the German law.
One newspaper even talks about a &quot;bloody ideology,&quot; the auflebe again.
The murders of eight Turkish descent and a Greek small business in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This message is a response in Turkey and in the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and worry.
For many German-Turks is returning a long-totgeglaubtes ghost: Since the arson attacks in Moelln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 there has been no comparable right-wing extremist violence with more background against Turks.
That in Germany there was xenophobia, but never in question.
The uncovered right-wing network, however, discloses dimensions whose dimension is far from sight.
&quot;Is the bloody ideology again?&quot; headline in the online edition of Turkish newspaper &quot;Haberturk&quot;.
The newspaper &quot;Sabah&quot;, however, stressed that one of the perpetrators should have been an undercover agent of the secret service, and is concerned that German authorities could be involved in the right-wing swamp.
Prudent response, the Turkish Community in Germany: they remembered at the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin had thought, together with German and Turkish leaders in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish Anwerbeabkommens.
In bright colors, the interaction had been staged - as a history of success.
Seems like a slap in the face because the reporting of some Turkish media: &quot;Germany&#39;s gift to the Fiftieth&quot; is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform &quot;Haber X&quot;, the lecture series, the background to the murder.
Germany and the issue of &quot;Hurriyet&quot; can not take it, to draw such association.
&quot;It starts to stink,&quot; is the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
He emphasized the fact that people had been murdered, and paid the taxes paid by their work makes an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany had.
Extremely critical in Turkish-German Internet forums, the actions of the police and their investigation discussed later success.
Why is the German authorities had not already occurred much more likely to be sought in extreme right-wing circles for suspects, surprised the authors.
Some people show themselves to be at least rhetorically drastic means available, &quot;Will this still sloppy, it remains the migrants have no other than self-defense and weapons.&quot;
&quot;Probably the best self-protection will be.&quot;
&quot;From the quality of information and appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network very much depends on the internal peace in Germany,&quot; writes &quot;selenium&quot;.
What does it mean when is the inner peace in Germany in danger of attacks illustrated the Mölln and Solingen in the nineties.
The photo of the burned-out shell of Solingen is deeply rooted in the German and Turkish memories.
For no other event of the Turks living here showed clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans, that distrust and distance in the right lead to violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the sense of identity on the Turkish side.
The mistakes of the past does not repeat
The Turkish press was criticized at the time, especially the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Molln.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish President, was on the memorial ceremony in Cologne, however, represented by its Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel was one time in his speech, like many Turks, the local taxes contributed.
As if, to calculate the value of a human being according to the amount of his taxes.
The current reporting of the Turkish media once again shows how deep is the distrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law ever since.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive education and re-evaluation of the right-wing terrorism in Germany, it takes time frank words.
The bank scandal of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not sitting in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS was nearly bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then slithers from one crisis to another.
Now it is directed by a German.
So it was not thought safe, Axel Weber.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank had become known in July that he would take up nearly as 2013, a spectacular new job: Chairman of the Swiss banking giant UBS - An unexpected and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber was looking forward publicly praised her beauty to Switzerland and UBS whether their new-found solidity and dropped friendly remarks about the future colleagues.
&quot;UBS has managed the turnaround.&quot;
&quot;I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger, Oswald Grübel.&quot;
But in September it became clear that everything would turn out quite differently.
A trader at UBS in London, had bypassed all the security systems of the bank and gambled around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS chief executive Oswald Grübel, a place famous not only bankers in Switzerland, had to go.
The chairman of UBS has since become a well struck - and everyone asks: When will come Axel Weber?
It was already known that Weber must advise the Bank from February 2012.
And the Chairman of the Board, he is already in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
Axel Weber is hard.
He is not a banker, but economics professor and central bankers, and had a training period had certainly needed.
At a stroke he takes over the responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proved once again that she has already earned the title of &quot;biggest bank scandal of Europe.&quot;
Because UBS is a huge part - until recently it was the largest asset managers in the world - and slides on the other hand for years of a scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, remains of the once-proud Swiss bank saves.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and sound, but also savvy Swiss wealth manager they had combined with ambitious goals: they wanted to be in investment banking is a very large number.
Sun managed by UBS in 2007 on the one hand with $ 1.6 trillion more money for wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it was advanced as an investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world.
That makes an impression.
The former banker and later years of banking in Zurich Professor Hans Geiger says: &quot;I have my students at that time, UBS still held up as model of a good bank.&quot;
&quot;In retrospect, one wonders: How could I be wrong just like that?&quot;
He was wrong.
In 2007, apparently for the first time that something went wrong in belonging to UBS.
Middle of the year was chief executive Peter Wuffli back surprisingly, regarded until then as well as a highly intellectual and brilliant bankers.
A few months later they guessed why he was gone.
The Investment Division of the Bank had gambled with subprime securities and had to write off billions.
To the shoulder, UBS announced a capital increase of as much as 13 billion francs.
But they did find investors, but what about the many to have turned up shortly before the nose: a non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so secret that not even heard his name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, it was worse.
The new bank had to announce billions in losses, Chairman Marcel Ospel, 2006 or the second best-paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008 came the catastrophe be the UBS was considering its bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the government.
The National Bank purchased from UBS for billions problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation were six billion francs for a mandatory convertible, which they could be co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because she realized how dramatic it is for a small country, if it home to such large banks.
Finally, the total assets of UBS 2007 more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
&quot;Once again we could not save the UBS,&quot; says Bank researchers violinist.
At the first disaster was followed to the second.
A few months later capitulated in the UBS tax dispute with the United States and agreed to publish the data of wealthy clients, who had probably evaded taxes with the help of the bank.
They also agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars - in repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including criminal charge.
Thus, UBS, more or less openly confessed to have helped with tax evasion.
At the same time she lost something that had always been their capital in the competition for rich customers: the aura of secrecy.
After the scandal was not the same Swiss banking secrecy.
It was followed by the resignation of CEO and chairman.
And the exodus of client funds.
Thus, the bank had lost its credibility within a few months in both the central business areas: investment banking through the incorrect speculation and asset management with the help of tax evasion.
And just when it was a bit quiet again, just when you thought, now that UBS would have done it again, there follows this unfortunate story Dealer: An individual trader gambled 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it is evident: The risk management in investment banking, you&#39;re still not clear.
&quot;The case has Adoboli you have to realize that the risk control has changed little,&quot; said Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the University of Zurich bank.
Also, the CFO of a major German bank is confident: &quot;The problem with that UBS&#39;s risk control is not under control.&quot;
It was exactly the idea of ​​caution was that the Swiss bankers were begun long ago, keeper of the great fortunes of the world are to: not too much risk, but security for the money - might also be beyond the Alpine republic once to collapse the world .
The vaults of Swiss banks had become a symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for very fine chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich, still fits the stereotype of the dignified Swiss private bank - it&#39;s just a bit larger.
The location alone is classic.
The Bank is headquartered at the Zurich Bahnhofstrasse, which leads directly to the main station of Zurich, which is framed by the snowcapped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany&#39;s can be found here between the traditional Swiss shops like Sprüngli.
Reside here for centuries, the Swiss banks: National Bank of the Palace of the Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Baer.
The reception hall of the UBS is entered through a heavy revolving door.
Inside are marble-clad walls, standing in front of thick leather chair, next to the bank logo a large sign for &quot;safe&quot;.
UBS knows what the client looks here: security.
This idea of ​​the Swiss bank have both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but eventually supplanted - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank is.
His name he would rather not read in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, even with the two commercial banks.
UBS has become too large, it is - especially in investment banking, which had also spread the Anglo-Saxons.
The Swiss would have to say there&#39;s nothing more.
&quot;And if they do, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot;
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, UBS changed, gave her first big profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost in the subprime jungle as much money as the Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the visible disaster.
&quot;That Wednesday, the government decided Coalition of the small country&#39;s seven million, the biggest bailout in the history of their nation,&quot; the author writes Luke Hässig in his book &quot;The UBS-Crash&quot;.
Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros granted to politicians in order to save the bank from bankruptcy standing.
How could this happen?
When speaking with Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, included two of the three major Swiss banks together into a huge corporation.
There was a bank that was already in the merger too big for the little Switzerland - and ever growing.
It helped that the two different precursor banks UBS completed: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on Asset Management in Zurich and a poorer, but even more internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers were favorable to a lot of money with which they could turn a giant wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS&#39;s Peter Wuffli, 2001-2007 CEO of UBS, Marcel Ospel, and, then Chairman of the Board.
&quot;I always thought Wuffli and Ospel had a dream team,&quot; says Bank researchers Hans Geiger.
&quot;Wuffli, the high intellectuals, Modest, who knows a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man, who has worked up by the bank clerk to the top.&quot;
But Ospel had to leave at the end of Wuffli.
And at the end Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake: &quot;He thought that his models were the reality,&quot; says Geiger.
&quot;This is a tragic case.&quot;
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear that arrogance came before a fall.
Employees of UBS remember much of the leadership meetings where CEO Wuffli spent repeating the same slogan: Goldman Sachs, on this day.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the &quot;league tables&quot; that rank lists, the success of the banks at that time documented.
Then did the UBS to the top.
Some steps had already succeeded her.
In the foreign exchange and equity trading business, she appeared at the top.
Consultants who were commissioned lifted, however, shows a weakness in the international business interest in the language of bankers &quot;fixed income&quot;, there is a huge gap to the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that nearly cost them their existence.
Hungry for growth investing, both the bank acts as a hedge fund founded in front of her in American sub-prime assets.
It developed into a powerful machine, the securities of American mortgages packaged and passed it - but it also kept itself risks.
Even more than other banks long since sought the exit.
&quot;In the summer of 2007 when the U.S. housing market was on fire, UBS has bought there,&quot; said banking expert violinist.
As great as the euphoria, so deep is the case.
A manager had to go after the other, as the clean up efforts ausfielen difficult than expected.
Positions at UBS were the ejection seat and are still shaky.
Who Leads the bank has an almost impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank of any adjacent business models have been lost.
Bank researchers Geiger has already an idea: Stop the investment banking, focusing on asset management, return to the roots in Switzerland.
Quite as much the bank will not (yet) do not.
But investment banking is expected to shrink strongly, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday will the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti the world to present its future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was meant only as a temporary solution, as the bank is surprisingly Grübel from previous split.
Meanwhile, he has prevailed: he will always lead the operations of UBS, said the Zurich-based bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti will return the investment bank to the state in the mid nineties.
3,500 jobs, he emphasizes.
It is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What they want to earn money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is now safe.
Publicly, he says so far only, he would find his wife only once a flat in Zurich.
Next year.

Smart crows spread in cities
In many places, rooks are considered &quot;problem birds&quot; But from the cities, the highly intelligent animals long since ceased to distribute, say experts.
The one they like, they want to get rid of the other very quickly: crows belong to the city for centuries, but many local residents&#39; complaints are piling on the dirt and noise of the animals.
It is an antidote to the &quot;problem birds&quot; not yet in sight.
Rooks were received from the cities to not get out, experts said at the first symposium in the East Frisian idle crows.
There, experts from all over Germany advised on possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists led it to back problems in cities and the rural exodus of specially protected rooks: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroy the traditional habitats.
The hunt, increasing development and the felling of trees made the typical breeding birds life difficult.
Crows are protected.
There are large colonies of more than 600 breeding pairs in it, among other things Soest, in North West, including in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, and in space.
There in 2005 a controversial project for the mass murder of crows in the county had provided for negative headlines.
Critics have called the trapping of animals in bird traps and the slaying with clubs as particularly brutal.
&quot;The normal displacement, the aversive conditioning, does not work&quot;, the city planner and landscape Werner Klover stated in Leer.
Nests with water airborn or fell trees have often undesirable consequences, also said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Wuerttemberg.
&quot;The animals of soft, large colonies split up and spread to other places.&quot;
Deterrence would be considered only as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
&quot;We have to live with them, we can no longer get away.&quot;
Without leaving the surrounding area, the problem is not solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner empty.
Conceivable is a combination of aversive conditioning of the animals from sensitive residential areas and bait advertising, in order to resettle elsewhere.
&quot;Information boards instead of chainsaws&quot; advertised, however, the psychologist and anthropologist Mary Uta Juergens for a completely different way of dealing with the animals: &quot;a pimple on the face, we can finally bear most confident.&quot;
Jurgens had in Schleswig-Holstein the Aschenberger Crow Trail co-founded information on the signs of the life of the highly intelligent rooks.
The project will now been taken by tourists.
Even the criticism of the noise of the birds Jurgens had their own opinion: &quot;Because a lot of communication that have much to say to each other.&quot;
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: rooks not only use tools, in order to get a treat, but make it as a tool tooling, even himself.
Behavioral scientist at Cambridge University recently tested at four rooks, as far as the intelligence of birds.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they must bring with stones a scaffolding collapse in order to reach a moth larva.
Without much training they knew determined what size and shape of a stone must have in order to bring down the platform.
In a second experiment, the crows had to be smart to solve a problem kniffligeres.
In a vertically arranged cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had them put down pieces of wire.
From all four animals formed a hook that allows it then fished the bucket by the handle of the tube.
Three of the four Rooks succeeded in this even from the start.

Mass slaughter on a personal level
Empathetic and generous begins Peter Englund&#39;s new book &quot;Beauty and terror. A History of the First World War, told in nineteen fates&quot; with a long list of main characters, the one goes to the heart.
Here&#39;s a tip on how one might proceed: Carefully cut out this page and take it to your bookmarks.
You will get to know these people in Englund&#39;s novelistic narrative very well. And these people are the main function as your GPS, a beacon in those few moments when you lose like men and women Englund in the fog of war and stripped of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish journalist and historian.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he describes is not incorrect as &quot;a work of anti-history.&quot;
It contains only a few big names, major contracts or famous battles. There is no ambassador, racing reporter, and discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he says, but rather &quot;a book about how it was.&quot; It is about &quot;feelings, impressions, experiences and moods.&quot;
&quot;Beauty and terror,&quot; the experiences of war nearly 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, from schoolgirls to botanists and climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people are heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives to flicker like votive candles in a church, some are added, while others go out.
Englund&#39;s book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating trench warfare on the Western Front was.
&quot;Beauty and terror&quot; moves with expert views of other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are beehives, a celebrated Christmas in Egypt among the pyramids, tsetse flies are an unsolvable problem.
This is almost the beginning of a moving point.
The war overwhelmed the lives of these people as a natural disaster like a hurricane Katrina, the smell of cordite.
Imagine you are a woman who is with her children at home, and hears gunfire in the distance. Stay or take the flight?
If you come at all?
Hardly anyone knows what happened or why this war is ever done.
&quot;Lack of facts,&quot; said Englund notes, &quot;were pepped with assumptions, beliefs, hopes, fears, obsessions, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.&quot;
&quot;Beauty and Terror&quot; follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailors.
Their stories were mostly memories, letters and other measures already taken from published materials.
Their life stories can be scary or poignant, but they are very much alive in the smaller details Englund losing collection of moments.
Many of them deal with shortages and remedies yourself.
In the story of a German girl&#39;s school, he says, &quot;Spare, spare everywhere.&quot;
&quot;Ersatz coffee, aluminum false, incorrect, erasers, paper boards, wooden buttons.&quot;
He tells more of the replacement of Essen in Germany.
He describes &quot;meat (and was recently served with a false bone in wood) made of pressed rice and fried in mutton fat was tobacco, which was made from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes were soled with wood.&quot;
There were, as he notes, &quot;837 registered food substitutes that were allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitute.&quot;
Some stories deal with honor and valor.
An American recognizes his own urge for wildness and tells about the war: &quot;We feel that this is after all what was likely intended for men than in the easy chair to sit in with the evening paper or the seller and a cigarette and a whiskey hand, and to pretend that meant such a facade of civilization and barbarism, as if there were not behind their starched and studded shirt-front. &quot;
Conversely, a British soldier recognizes that he would probably die and no one take any notice or care.
&quot;When the idea of ​​sacrificing themselves, refrains, one might think that this is done before an audience,&quot; he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as &quot;a convicted man who was hanged in secret.&quot;
Other observations are about the old Europe that is falling apart, and new types of terrorism.
&quot;The conflict was increasingly becoming an economic competition,&quot; writes Englund, &quot;a war between the factories.&quot;
He captures the arrival of what he calls &quot;a new species in the bestiary of the still young century&quot;: &quot;the word clever and convincing ideological mass murderer in the tailored suit, the slaughter, while he sits behind a desk.&quot;
People behave in unexpected ways and there are just as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who were trying actively to infect himself with a prostitute with a venereal disease, to escape the front lines.
&quot;The grotesque expression which can be found in trade with gonococcal pus, because soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals, hoping to come into hospital,&quot; he writes.
&quot;Those who were really desperate to rub it in their eyes, which meant that they were blind to the rest of their lives.&quot;
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves Englund&#39;s poetry supple and yet unobtrusive and fits perfectly to his superhuman task.
In dozens of short scenes he captures the way the war as &quot;uncontrollable forces unleashed in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred&quot;.
People begin to wonder why they bring their leaders to fight.
The best books about the First World War were usually rather distorted as Paul Fussells &quot;Great War and Modern Memory,&quot; and novels such as Erich Maria Remarque&#39;s &quot;The Western Front&quot; as a comprehensive history.
Englund&#39;s band performs at an unconventional Hall of Fame.
His book has the most devastating end that I have ever read in a fiction book.
I give her no more.
But it is as if he had snapped his book with us this side of the main characters in his face and lit with a match.
After an early misstep a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them were wearing helmets use.
They had decided on the night of Monday to Tuesday, because at that time few people in the park are Zucotti.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. All other initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was in their midst and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The events of recent weeks as the onset of pepper spray against protesters, which is against the rules of the Department and the squatters a huge increase in public sympathies were procured, not repeat itself.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training was conducted.
Officials had prepared for this by observing how appointments were handled in other cities.
A disaster drill was held with a view to Zuccotti on Randalls Iceland.
Officials increased the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid installation of a large number of police officers is one - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was held Monday night at the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to move into the park, came &quot;at the last minute,&quot; said someone who is familiar with the command, which spoke for a declaration as a &quot;practice&quot;.
&quot;The few policemen who were involved as I know did not know that it came to Zuccotti Park,&quot; said someone who wishes to remain anonymous.
&quot;The only ones who knew that it went to the Zuccotti Park, were the senior officials of the department.&quot;
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that was learned the city.
On 14 Officials wanted to vacate the park in October, but gave way back then, when hundreds of protesters gathered after they had learned of these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in the operation on Tuesday, including task forces from across the city - hundreds of mobile civil servant, which are normally used in high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people in the park come and go, almost as commuters, so that 1 clock at night is a good time to go inside.
&quot;It was appropriate to do so when the least number of people staying in the park,&quot; he said.
Ambulances with klieg lights and speakers stood in front of the exit at Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge ready.
The lamps and pre-recorded messages that boomed from the speakers, many seemed to intimidate protesters.
Invaded than the public officials in their light blue jackets in the park, many protesters simply snatched up her things and left the place.
The police said that would be touched to 1:45 clock no tents for the protesters to allow time to pack their belongings together.
Other teams of officers were seen as they gathered in the area to intervene should be necessary arrests in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said that this was done for their own safety.
But many journalists argue that they wanted to prevent them from observing the police actions in the park. And they said, the use of officials had been very rough.
Mr. Browne said that TV stands in Church Street on the west side of the park were able to make photos.
When the police in the west by the great jumble of personal belongings of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial turf and bags of clothes, moving, followed by its employees of the sanitation department who lifted what was left.
Some protesters who refused to go, were dragged out. Images from this appeared a short time later on the Internet.
One of the main core of protesters drew near the kitchen area of ​​the camp in the center of the park position.
Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people at the epicenter of the camp is bound together by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil defense officials were called to cut loose around her.
As Mr. Kelly said, until about 3:30 clock no arrests were carried out in the park.
The evacuation was completed, according to the police after 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Among the most arrests occurred, he said, because of &quot;disorderly conduct and resisting an arrest.&quot;
The most prominent local officials, Joseph J. Esposito was the head of the department&#39;s highest uniformed officer of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detective department, was also there.
Despite his presence, &quot;directed&quot; Mr. Kelly &quot;the operation is not&quot; as Mr. Browne said.
In the event that they should access, a second group of officers waiting on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
The Cortlandt Street, one block north of the park road, and at Pine Street, one block south, barricades were erected.
It could be observed from these locations as the police within the expanding itself to the Zuccotti Park around.
In one place was seen as more officials, many of them with shields, drove people out.
Approximately 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Clock ran south around 5 Pine Street one protester on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air in the tire of a police bus.
In a place threw the crowd a piece of plywood.
At the end came an officer and a protester to the hospital.
Managers of the union will file a lawsuit against the city because of layoffs
Have the union, the hundreds of school supervisors who lost their jobs last month, represents plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as layoffs teach because of their disproportionate influence in the schools, poor students, and do not necessarily discriminatory.
The action is probably the last opportunity for the union, District Council 37, in their efforts to make the layoffs reversed is still open.
Sechshundertzweiundsiebzig school assistants, care coordinators and other staff who were among the lowest paid employee of the city and on the 7th October had lost in a move by their work, the union leaders have described as political revenge for that last year the city access to a health fund, which amused the workgroup, had denied to the budgetary gap should be closed.
These accusations were categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, said Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools in the last month that the layoffs were part of the budget that we have adopted in June.
A member of the City Council fired back, telling him that nothing in the Budget Just specify that employees of the school aid would be released.
Officials of the City Council 37 said they had warned the Ministry of Education and before an action. On Wednesday there will be a press conference at which the filing of the suit in the Supreme Court will be announced formally in Manhattan.
The suit will perform Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the City as a defendant and eight laid-off workers are counted as plaintiff, all of which are colored or Hispanic women, like most of the workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department of the city, said the city would not be before the lawsuit and therefore could not be commented on their individual claims.
According to a lawsuit design, the New York Times exists, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in the slums of the city to support a claim for discrimination. She claims that poor schools have lost more workers since they are chronically underfunded.
She argues that while there were no layoffs on Staten Iceland and few layoffs in the schools of the Upper East Side and TriBeCa, have lost 17 school volunteers in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 volunteers in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx were dismissed.
By noting the loss of five out of eight school volunteers who in the public schools and 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, were hired, says the lawsuit: &quot;This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents, the donations can organize to absorb budget cuts. &quot;
P.S.: The budget of the 36th District has been reduced this year by 3.26 percent. In addition, funds were lost when the city changed its calculation method for the extra funding for each charity school enrollment.
The union complains also that the head of the high schools by the language in the memo have been misled, which approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word &quot;excess&quot; to describe the action, even if the &quot;excess&quot; (German: on set) in the U.S. usually describes the change of a teacher on the payroll of a school in a pool of available workers from the Central Office be paid.
&quot;Sixty-six care coordinators were fired, not transferred,&quot; says the suit design.
Mission accomplished, Congress ready to communicate regarding Libya
It looks like finally, as Republicans and Democrats in Washington had already come to an agreement regarding the riots in Libya.
All that was needed was for this purpose, the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of longtime dictator Muammar Qaddafi and the end of American intervention.
On Thursday, the committee decides on International Relations of the Senate a resolution that the Chairman John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut) is subject to, and Libya to the successful rebellion and the U.S. American troops for their &quot;courage&quot; praises.
&quot;This resolution honors the brave people of Libya, which began with the reconstruction of their country,&quot; said Kerry.
&quot;It is an affirmation of support for their democratic efforts by two parties.&quot;
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing was easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, arguing lawmakers of both parties and the White House over the wording of a number of resolutions for approval or disapproval of the role of the U.S. military in Libya Mission to NATO.
In June, the Kerry and McCain in front of a resolution which approved the limited use of military forces of the United States in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the Senate by a wide fringe of both parties and there was no vote.
But this law was on the same day by the Senate. In addition, the board overruled a decision to cut the funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
Thus, the U.S. mission fell into a sort of legislative purgatory - with a congress that was applied but enough to criticize Obama&#39;s approach in the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull him to the ground under their feet.
Then the indecision of Congress has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell in August, was among the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi on 20 October killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate is perhaps ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations &quot;congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation&quot; and &quot;praising the men and women of the U.S. military and its coalition partner, the military operations to protect the people of Libya support for their extraordinary courage and professionalism. &quot;
The resolution also reaffirms &quot;the national interests of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy Libya&quot;.
Will the new measures to ensure full support of the Foreign Relations committee received or will they split the legislature, as did the Law of June?
The latest version is opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the committee.
Lugar spokesman said on Monday that he now the final version of the new law have not yet seen.
According to the Capitol, it&#39;s the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment, which calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every legislative term of the Republican Congress and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area, which is the time to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other lawmakers have tried unsuccessfully to get her to change to a vote, although they have tried often enough.
Good lattes change is only one of 68 constitutional amendments that were submitted to Congress and include a range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was both the Congress and the Senate presented - others differ only slightly from each other.
It is only in the Senate at least 15 versions of the balance budget amendment and a dozen more, the &quot;control federal spending&quot; would.
Some of the laws are identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners among the Republicans who want to polish up her resume - the opportunity to brag that they are &quot;written&quot; such a measure have.
The Budget Enforcement Act, passed in August, requires that both the Senate and Congress vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators for a non-binding resolution voted to support the idea of ​​such a change.
About the budget, some members are getting at the number of terms present, the members of Congress can limit, while the Republicans pick José E. Serrano (New York), the limit of two terms of office of the president wants.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of changes that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
An amendment that prohibits same-sex marriage is, as an amendment, which prohibits the burning of flags, a recurring template.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws, if two-thirds of the states reject this.
So eager, like the members to propose amendments, as they move much faster in recent years.
The 111th Congress submitted 77 such legislative changes. the 110th 66th Congress
The speed pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s, in which more than 150 regular members suggested changes every two years, the numbers, the Senate library.
But they were not much more successful than they are today.
The last change is to add the - the 27th - Was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
&quot;Got him, but not defeated,&quot; said Gifford&#39;s first television interview after the assassination
Ten months after a gunman had shot at close range during an election rally in Tucson on she joined the Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) on Monday night on national television. She sang alone for Broadway play &quot;The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow&quot; and said the desire to recover, to be greater than the return to the Congress.
When she along with Diane Sawyer in the ABC News &quot;20/20&quot; occurred, she struggled for words and needed help walking.
The broadcast showed the slow recovery from the severe damage that shared the ball, their skulls pierced the left side of her brain and crosses her head from front to back, has had done.
Three months ago, she returned unexpectedly returned to Congress and triumphantly cast their vote on the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the assassination attempt in January, which killed six people and injured 13 were Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as &quot;difficult&quot;.
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, said Gifford (41): &quot;Very well.&quot;
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour &quot;20/20&quot; specials, which was shortly before the release of the new book of the couple recorded: &quot;Gabby: A story about courage and hope.&quot;
The Special pursued Giffords recovery since the assassination of 8 January.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you see them in the hospital bed, with shaven head and a long scarf over his forehead.
You can only lift a finger or two, when her husband encouraged her.
Months later, Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair, while therapists to show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod of the head.
A twitch of the lips.
And then, her first words: &quot;What.&quot;
After a few days Giffords whispers a word &quot;toast&quot;. She wants her breakfast is changed.
Videos that are played on the ABC show, show that music played an important role in Giffords&#39; recovery: You can see how the Congressmen together with the therapist to Cyndi Lauper&#39;s &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot; and Tom Petty&#39;s &quot;Free Fallin &#39;&quot;sings.
In an interview with Sawyer said Gifford, who spends two hours a day with therapy, that she can not remember the day of the attack can.
Her husband said he Giffords on 12 March, a newspaper article one had read about the assassination, when she interrupted him and for the first time in six people asked who had been killed during the attack.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri, and is forcibly medicated, while he awaits his trial.
&quot;Many people have died,&quot; Giffords told Sawyer.
&quot;Hard, hard, hard.&quot;
During the recovery of his wife, so Kelly told Sawyer she said: &quot;I was hit.&quot;
&quot;So, I would say:&quot; Gabby, you were not defeated, said Kelly, &quot;&quot;.
You were just made.
And you&#39;ll get through this and you will relax you and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel pity rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala, the millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City collected.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On cue, gathered hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The amount in black tuxedos stood and applauded.
&quot;The servicemen and women were seen as heroes,&quot; said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraiser in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, which was observed among others by the Chief of Staff and former chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of different forces.
&quot;They were introduced as orphans,&quot; the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I&#39;m sure the organizers have been kind.
I know that
But there was no respect, not really. It was pity.
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops will be showered with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say service members.
The public is increasingly behaving as if their men in uniform would do harm.
&quot;We were not victims,&quot; ​​said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, commander of the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will soon go.
&quot;But apparently, the only way the support is the one to squeeze us into the role of unfortunate souls.&quot;
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who are not ungrateful or in conflict with the public, who want to serve them appear.
They have also realized that the anger, the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was met, was far worse.
As a result of conversations taking place about compassion in private between breastfeeding and war veterans.
After his two sons have returned from battles with the Marines warned the retired colonel Mark Cancian, they warned that people could see their world outside the military service from two different perspectives.
Some would consider it with a sense of awe, as they defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there is a &quot;raging, violent veteran under the surface&quot; conceals said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over after his return, a senior government positions in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interviewer subtly inquired if he was able to withstand the same after returning from combat the pressures of a demanding post in Washington.
&quot;When you talk about your ministry, you have to contrast the negative impressions hold,&quot; said Cancian his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is rooted partly in the lack of American interest in the war.
Performance on the battlefield are from a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, rarely singled out as praise.
&quot;We appreciate as a nation no longer military heroism as it was very common during World War II,&quot; said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, focus the praise of politicians and the public largely to the plight of a service member.
Troops gain recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends who have lost them or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces up to growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men are accused of non-intervention in a rape before a military court.
If it does not happen, there are hundreds of plaintiffs ready for the next hearing.
Lance Corporal Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th Weeks pregnant when she was raped by a soldier colleagues at night.
It was in October 2008 and they returned to their barracks in Miramar just north of San Diego from dinner with a friend back when she met a male colleague who was carrying a 12-pack of beer with him.
He asked if he could accompany them for a drink in her room.
&quot;My alarm bells went on,&quot; said Lyman.
But the Texan brushed aside their concerns.
I thought, &quot;Oh, he is 19
He is from Texas, &quot;she said.
&quot;I wish I had on my gut feeling is.&quot;
A few minutes after they had left on Lyman&#39;s room, the man walked up behind her, pressed her down and raped her, she says.
This week, on 18 November wait Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel anxious to a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, decided in the will, whether an action they have against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld charged , is admissible in court.
The complaint alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld are not taken against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In February, Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, DC filed the lawsuit initially covered 17 applicants, which increased but in the following months to 28 months: 25 women and three men who claim all that they were raped by soldiers, colleagues or sexually abused, and that the military failed to investigate, or condemn adequately provide law after the alleged attack is available.,
Burke says they follow the top military leadership, as the problem begins there.
&quot;The military is hierarchical,&quot; she says.
&quot;Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retribution? The leadership.&quot;
Burke also says that she has contacted since February, nearly 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs say lay their eggs in one basket, they will, if necessary, submit as many other actions to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by Attorney General Neil MacBride has made an application to dismiss.
The records of the court that there Newsweek keep a detailed on the defense strategy in the first place, that the military can not be sued by current or former soldiers for violations, which have occurred in the armed forces.
Because of a law of the Supreme Court in 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries that are in active service soldiers inflicted.
&quot;The alleged damage incurred during military service of the plaintiff,&quot; says the document.
The Defense Ministry refused to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, so the distinction is only in name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan teams play increasingly important roles of soldiers, particularly in make contact with local women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars killed 150 soldiers, two-thirds of them in combat.
It is time that the military is modernized, says Burke.
And it is in their struggle not alone: ​​three additional cases are pending in addition to their.
At Yale Law School prepares the Veterans&#39; Legal Services Clinic, a lawsuit against the four major military academies because of alleged support of a misogynistic atmosphere.
Regardless of this collects the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America, a lawsuit against the military, is based upon the diagnosis of &quot;personality disorder&quot; concentrated, received rape victim, in order to remove from office - a common practice, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of Service Women&#39;s Action Network, a human rights group.
Your group filed suit in December against the Veterans Administration (engl.: the Veterans Administration) a, in which she accused her discriminatory practices in their handling of benefit claims for people who reported having been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were independently submitted by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, the Congress, provide a set of clues.
(: Office for preventing and reporting sexual abuse dt) of the Department of Defense 3158 sexual abuse appear in 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office was.
But most abuses are reported at all and considered by the Pentagon&#39;s own estimate of this number about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19 000 cases, which occur every year.
The report, published in March examined the prosecution rates: 2010 20 percent of the recorded cases were in the military court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiff in Burke&#39;s case, describing their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman&#39;s case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
That night, she says, she has been asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape, a number of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a Vergewaltigungsset and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During the hearing she was asked about the sex they had before the attack with her boyfriend.
Six people said, as a character witness on behalf of the alleged perpetrator of which was ultimately acquitted.
&quot;I remember well the day when the verdict was read,&quot; says Lyman.
&quot;I thought the labor would be used. I ran screaming from the courtroom.&quot;
&quot;They took me to the psychiatric department, and I remember that I did when I came out, told my commander.. That was not his case this was my method&quot;
Lyman was asked to see a military psychiatrist who ultimately diagnosed with a personality disorder and declared unfit for service.
In January 2010 she was dishonorably discharged, so that they receive no support.
Whether the action, the Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed, is progressing, is pure speculation, said John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes, &quot;In my view they should move forward.&quot;
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first asked the question.
I am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is lagging behind a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence, which brings with it a liability.
He adds: &quot;The odds are against them ... but it&#39;s important for them to try it.&quot;
These things will change only when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow their way, Burke will begin the lawyer of the plaintiff, with its hundreds of other plaintiffs in future cases.
&quot;We will fight the military in this regard, until it comes to reform,&quot; she says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls have eyes: As researchers observe on Facebook
Before he became the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Breivik Behring was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday had Breivik, who has confessed to having committed a school shooting in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: He has spent much time until his attack at his computer and with some of the millions of nationalists chat, support the far-right groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
That&#39;s easy - you just need to log in to Facebook.
&quot;We have found that it was not difficult to come to them,&quot; said Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British think tank Demos on the digital populism in Europe.
Facebook&#39;s hiding personal information is encyclopedic, Bartlett says that the researchers simply have to use the advertising tool of the page to their desired demographic data accurately determine with scientific accuracy - as do marketers for years.
Bartlett&#39;s team found a half-million fans of right-wing groups throughout Europe and aimed them with adds, but related instead to be with a new band or a new diet product, invited the adds users to take a survey, in which according to their level of education, their attitudes toward violence and assess their own future was asked.
Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues are able to more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries were to ask - without them even once had to leave her office.
&quot;It is a fairly new method of research,&quot; says Bartlett.
Some of the results come as no surprise. Online Sponsors of right-wing groups are mostly angry young, male, and about immigration.
But in a surprising twist kind of &quot;those who combine their online activism with offline activism rational, democratic and less violent than those who remain sitting behind their computer screens.&quot;
DEMOs work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a hot new tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, political scientists and medical researchers use the site to study everything from health issues to trends in society &quot;likes&quot;, text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, which add an average of three content per day, generated Facebook&#39;s &quot;data Supernova,&quot; a research boom that could increase the number of scientific papers with the name of this page in the title in the last five years by almost 800%.
For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook, the fact that you can study through this site people who would normally not reach with his clipboard on the street.
&quot;If you tried before, people to consult the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot;
&quot;They had to inform the first party and which was never granted access to them,&quot; says Bartlett.
&quot;If Facebook is this all away - go directly to them.&quot;
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to recognize and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and her colleagues have found that students who discussed their drunken stupor on Facebook, significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who were silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that peer students to monitor, for example, residential advisors, the page and help students when they postet too many status updates.
&quot;You can not solve a problem if you did not see it,&quot; said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno&#39;s co-author and director of Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children&#39;s Research Institute in the Washington Post.
&quot;We have found a way to identify children at risk, which would have otherwise found.&quot;
Facebook taps also constantly on the data of its own population.
The data team at the site has statistics on the relationship status, Valentine&#39;s Day, turnout in the midterm elections in 2010 and were National Happiness Index created (used primarily by looking at the information, which only has Facebook access - master of digital freedom have long known that the side of their should make large data repository accessible to others for research purposes.)
However, users of Facebook know that the page they observed whether they like it or not. To a friend who is thousands of miles away, to play Scrabble, can allow one side to deploy their own personal information.
But what if the users of Facebook is part of a survey, from which they do not even know something?
While researchers have a strict set of guidelines on how they collect their data offline, online anything goes.
&quot;I do not think many people have ever thought about the fact that a researcher might study their profiles,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, a study from 2006 in which he, the public pages of students studied on Facebook.
&quot;What they are concerned, it was all about her and her friends.&quot;
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the statements are true in a user profile and contributions.
&quot;What they say on Facebook, and what you do outside of Facebook, are two completely different things,&quot; says Selwyn.
Therefore, Selwyn thinks despite his years as a technology researcher that a clipboard and a pencil are still the best research tools, anyone can use.
&quot;There is no substitute for the real world go out and talk to real people,&quot; he says.
&quot;Social research must attend to the social - and a lot of social life still happens offline.&quot;
&quot;Cold and inhuman,&quot; Anders Breivik Behring first appears before a public court
Anders Breivik Behring, the man who has been two shootings in which this summer in Norway has 77 people were killed himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a &quot;resistance&quot; fighters described.
&quot;I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knight Templar in Norway,&quot; he told a courtroom with more than 500 people.
&quot;I raise an objection to the court, since you received your mandate of organizations that support the ideologies of hatred, multiculturalism and because it is supported.&quot;
&quot;I acknowledge the laws but I do not plead guilty.&quot;
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik interrupted during this monologue because he &quot;did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can bring his views to express.&quot;
For the same reason he refused Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, leave, turn to the end of the hearing to the relatives of his victims.
Nesheim also ordered that the police reserves Breivik for 12 more weeks in custody, he spent four weeks without access to the media. He said that the authorities of all visits and all correspondence will control just over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some were hoping to be able to see into the eyes Breivik, others wanted to confirm that it remains under lock and key.
Everyone participated with the aim that everything boils down to an incarceration.
&quot;I thought, he seems cold and inhuman,&quot; said a survivor of Utoya the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
&quot;It was uncomfortable, but for me it goes a step further, since I have seen the suspect and heard.&quot;
Breivik was wearing a dark suit and a blue tie and worked throughout the hearing calmly and professionally. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered the building and then left.
Despite Breiviks bizarre note, he would be part of a larger &quot;resistance&quot; movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
It may suit some, that the attacks of 22 July seems to be the work of an individual and not the extremists was a radical group.
But makes it easy to automatically grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
&quot;I wish he looked like a monster, but he does not,&quot; said the relatives of a victim.
&quot;It would be so much easier if he did.&quot;
7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which this week has been shown in a theater
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October compared with some of his Henry Ford and the engineering genius picked it out as a great modern inventors.
What to find Apple fans but perhaps most telling in the recently rediscovered job interview that has been dusted off this week before feature presentations in major markets, is to understand how much of this creative force business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who tinkered busily diagrams - a man who believed that many managers suffer from &quot;a disease of thinking&quot; that &quot;a truly great idea makes up 90 percent of the work ... [but] there is a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product. &quot;
In 1995, Bob Cringely, the TV series &quot;Triumph of the nerds&quot; on the dawn of the personal computer. And he sat for over an hour, along with jobs in which they performed a rare, detailed conversations.
At that time had passed than 10 years since Apple had been forced out of jobs. And he worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and looked forward to the wide acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringleys interview was used to track specialists, he says, that the master copies of the interview were missing on delivery.
It was only after Jobs&#39;s death it was discovered a complete copy of VHS in the garage of the Director.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the film 68minütigen &quot;Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview,&quot; which is this Wednesday and Thursday at the Landmark Theatre.
For someone who is well known that he abhors in-depth interviews, Jobs appears surprisingly busy here in the explanation of its technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
During the interview it comes to four times longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds pondering where jobs clearly weighing his thoughts and endeavors to accuracy.
There are also times when jobs come &#39;perfectionism to light when he apparently responded impatiently for him anschubst Cringelys questions and more quickly respond to themes or subplots of greater importance.
Taken before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, the Lost interview appears somehow incredibly far-sighted, if rated jobs, do what other companies he believes is right or wrong, and his own vision for the future of computing.
It is one thing, posthumous tributes read the career jobs&#39;. But jobs here to be seen as the avid dreamer who is on the verge of greatness, something is very different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Shortly after this here is accomplished, he went and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost interview:
How he learned to run a business:
&quot;Throughout the years in business I always ask:&quot; Why are you doing things? &quot;And the answer that you are getting is.&quot; Oh, so it is easy to make. &quot;
No one knows why he does what he does. Nobody in the business really thinks about things in depth.
I&#39;ve found.
Jobs will continue its efforts of, to streamline the accounting records at Apple.
Amazed at how costs have been recorded - usually began one with &quot;standard cost&quot;, which were estimated to be mere conjecture to and which were then matched with &quot;deviation&quot; - he developed an automated factory, which ensured that the cost of doing business could be determined down to the smallest .
As the Pope was ridiculed:
Jobs talks about the &quot;blue box&quot;, which he built with Steve Wozniak, has a device that lets you sneak into the phone company and could result in long-distance calls for free.
About the unit has been written about much, but jobs enthusiasm, as he describes the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box by using a paid phone, make a call and then connect from an AT &amp; T network to another as they grind through as many satellites as possible.
&quot;We sent things half a dozen times around the globe and if you bellowed into the phone, it was one minutes later the phone out next door again,&quot; says Jobs, chuckling.
&quot;We were young and we learned that we can create something for yourself, can control the billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.&quot;
Both of us, we did not know much, but we did not build this little thing that can control a huge thing, that was an incredible lesson and I do not think it would be without Apple.
Jobs goes on to tell of a glorious trick Wozniak and he almost pulled off, as they in the middle of the night via the Blue Box at the Vatican called and wanted to speak with the Pope, as best they could while Henry Kissinger imitated.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak with American diplomats, the two had to laugh out before the Pope himself got on the phone.
As he was in love with the technology (and unexpectedly called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 years ago when he was looking for replacement parts to build a frequency counter, he was looking for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute telephone call received for summer jobs part time job at Hewlett-Packard.
&quot;It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company that I had seen at that age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees.&quot;
Later Jobs was one of the HP employees who visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he was &quot;the first desktop computer that was ever produced,&quot; saw.
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with the Braun tube, and I fell in love with him.
I would climb at HP as a teenager and hanging up on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times a job interview, how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career when he attached some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment deadline by thinking of only 30 days and had both the assembly and the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he recalls the problems he had in the development of a computer mouse:
&quot;I remember at sweeping arguments ... They shouted at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse, the $ 300 would cost] and I got up, went outside and found a manufacturer.&quot;
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we were able to build for $ 15. That was incredibly believable.
About big companies, the decrease:
Long before he was revived Apple, Jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial giants came with their visions into stumbling and lost control of their shares advance.
&quot;Let&#39;s say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you better make a copier or printer, so what?&quot;
You have the share monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it successful, so [there are such people], which ultimately lead the company and the product with which people are forced out of the decision.
The product genius that led to this monopoly, is from people who have no concept about good vs. products. bad products, cut - Crafts necessary.
This happened at Xerox ...
Xerox could have the whole computer industry.
It would have been ten times greater than can be that Microsoft could have been the 1990s ...
They got the defeat from victory.
On innovation as an art form:
&quot;There a lot of craftsmanship is between a great idea and a great product ... if you developed this great idea, it changes and grows.&quot;
You learn a lot about its intricacies.
You have to vote to make certain things you can not, however, electrons, glass, robot factories.
One has to remember things 5000, these concepts and bring them all ...
Ultimately it comes down to taste, have it boils down to is that people try to create the best stuff that people set apart and then trying to bring these things into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shamelessly stealing the great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, curators, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
Had it not been for the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the laws of health, accepts as a court case
On the day of the gathering of the Supreme Court behind closed doors to discuss the political dividing question of whether it will hear a challenge to the health law by President Obama, two measures of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner which was sponsored by the law firm that represented the case to court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine justices came to a meeting to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases was treated to an action, 26 states have raised against the far-reaching health care reform, the last year have been decided by Congress, a bill that among conservative activists everywhere in the U.S. was a buzzword.
The judge agreed with the hearing. In fact, in March, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected probably the result of which will probably boost the presidential campaign in 2012, which at the time when the court decision is announced, will be in full swing.
The lawyer who will stand in court and argue that the law is to tilt will probably be Paul Clement, former Attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clements Law Firm, PLLC Bancroft was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-established group that is dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day represents one of the industry associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, to challenge the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is financially involved in the outcome of the process enormously.
The dinner was held a few hours after the court had deliberated on the case, place in a Washington hotel.
Service had, among other things Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of health care reform
Guests at the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges visit the Federalist Society events for years.
And that does not violate ethical rules.
In fact, judges freed from the Code of Conduct, which governs the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under the principle 4c of the Code, which states that: &quot;A judge may participate in fundraisers law related and other organizations, the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or as per the program does not host such events.&quot;
Nevertheless, the extreme closeness of Scalia and Thomas filed two out of the case related to law firms and a company with a strong financial interest in this to alert morality and government activists.
&quot;This startling break with morality and contrary to the Code punishes the actions of certain judges lie, the Court should consider itself to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, a citizens&#39; rights movement in the United States.
&quot;The judges and won over a dinnierten Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending before the court.&quot;
Their presence and support of a fundraiser for this event undermine any claim to impartiality, and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have little regard for critics who say it would matter to court lightly with groups who are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society, mix.
And Thomas&#39; wife, Ginni is a known conservative activist.
By contrast, the conservatives argue that it was Judge Elena Kagan, who have a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was Attorney General under the Obama administration, when the first legal challenges in the first instance before a judge.
Your critics urged Kagan, withdraw himself from the hearing of the case because of bias, since it is involved too much in the defense of the law to be impartial.
Kagan makes no attempt to do so.
Boeing takes record order of 18 trillion dollars worth of land
Emirates airline ordered 50 two-course Boeing 777 with an option for 20 additional aircraft.
In addition, six Boeing Dreamliner, Boeing sold to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $ 1 trillion.
It is truly a rare news that a company gets an order for 50 units of its products.
But it&#39;s a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft as a whole is at a record sum of 18 trillion dollars.
Equally unusual is the customer of Boeing Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines needed from the Middle East over the next 20 years 2520 airplanes worth 450 trillion dollars.
Boeing announced at the weekend its largest order ever for commercial aircraft, based on the value of the order: 50, two popular Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer was commissioned by the Dubai based Emirates Airline.
The airline has also, so Boeing announced it in 2011 at the Dubai Air Show, an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which can increase the total list price to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, according to then ordered six Boeing 787-8 Boeing Oman Air, the so-called Dreamliner, which improves fuel economy and comfort of passengers enormously.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than 1 trillion dollars.
&quot;This is absolutely positive for Boeing,&quot; said Neal Dihora, stock market expert to Morningstar.
&quot;The quality of this particular customer is very high.&quot;
Many airlines in the Middle East are in the possession of the oil-producing countries.
So they not only have the money to pay for the aircraft. Rather, a rise in oil prices, which harms the airlines in general, because this is one of their biggest cost items, not as damaging as the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
&quot;They have a natural hedge,&quot; he said.
The appointment of Emirates Boeing confirms leadership position in the market for large aircraft and helps keep the rival Airbus SAS in check, attacking the supremacy of the A350.
Boeing&#39;s victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would delay deployment of the main A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
They postponed the launch to gain more confidence after the customer had a higher payload and range required.
The Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $ 67.94.
Sister of the Mexican president apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon has claimed that supports drug dealers Fausto Vallejo opponents of the PRI in the race for the governorship.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon has apparently lost its bid for the governorship of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday, drug dealers would affect the race in favor of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results obtained by Fausto Vallejo has the institutional revolutionary party, the PRI, the race for the governorship in the western state.
&quot;The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday&#39;s alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country,&quot; Calderon Maria Luisa in a radio interview a day after the election said on Sunday.
&quot;They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... you have voting booths occupied, roadblocks set up ... and asked people to vote for the [PRI].&quot;
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
The PRI is hoping for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have struck just Claderon, which had led in the polls before election day.
Calderon, a conservative candidate of the Partido Acción Nacional PAN her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano aureoles, the candidate of the PRD left Democratic Revolutionary Party, the current lame duck governor, came in third place, a heavy defeat for the divided and hapless left-hand guide for the presidential election in 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital city of Morelia denies ties to drug traffickers and forced the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels, which have focused on marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to launch in December 2006, a military-led offensive against drug traffickers.
The violence is still going on.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election rally for Maria Luisa Calderon and many candidates have dropped out of fear of the local elections.
The PRI victory strengthens the party, no matter how distasteful the elections appear also in Michoacan.
The man, the PRI is represented in the race for the presidency probably is Enrique Pena Nieto, of Vallejo congratulated in Washington and said, &quot;I think this victory makes us look boldly into the next year.&quot;
ADB urges Asia to help in the rescue of the Euro zone
The Asian Development Bank (Asian Development Bank, ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the euro zone in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB headquarters in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world, &quot;everything in your power,&quot; must do to speed up the recovery of the currency bloc, either by the International Monetary Fund, or by direct mutual agreements.
He warned of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), the &quot;dispassionate&quot; look at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leaders and European resources through Asia a long-term collapse of the global economy helps prevent.
&quot;We&#39;re all in this together.&quot;
&quot;So everyone is helpful that Europe can help you out of this crisis,&quot; he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
&quot;Asia may be protected up to a certain extent, but it is not immune.&quot;
&quot;If China and India can help so, then by all means.&quot;
Europe&#39;s monetary union in recent months, fell into a severe debt crisis.
In recent days, Italy&#39;s increased interest costs on both dangerous and the Prime Minister of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emergence of severe debt crisis in Europe, stoking fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls, the leading emerging countries should join forces to support the euro zone.
Mr. Nag predicted that any support of Asia will be channeled through the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - offer its European partners in Asia, greater bargaining power - such as the purchase of bonds of the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, said that &quot;India will do everything in his power&quot; to help the euro zone, as the domestic economy is now suffering from the decline in exports and foreign capital flows drying out.
&quot;No one wants that the euro zone remains unstable and turbulent,&quot; he said.
&quot;We are facing great challenges and we must maintain a high growth level.&quot;
&quot;It is not an option, it&#39;s a job, where else can we work for our millions of young men and women.&quot;
Others argue that emerging economies like India have no reason to help the rich Europeans, even if they are facing major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at American University, Brown said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India, aid to Europe, of which more than 800 million of 2 dollars or less per day on . live
&quot;Eventually they will find out that the Greeks go with 50 to retire and spend holidays at the beach. Then you have a problem,&quot; he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum said, similarly, why should India&#39;s reserves are used to keep Greece in the numerous and well-paid public employees, with jobs in geleitetet bad losses transferring institutions such as the railways.
Mr. Nag said, that will have the crises in the euro zone &quot;significant domino effects&quot; to all of Asia.
The ADB forecast the economy to grow by 7.5 percent in Asia for years now 2011/droht &quot;the risk of the step&quot; because of the threat from Europe.
He said emerging markets would create vulnerable &quot;contingency plans&quot; in order to protect itself on a downward trend and a significant capital outflow properties of their word.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon to potential cuts in the defense sector
Defense Leon Panetta heated to Congress on Monday, when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed. So he set off a financial chain reaction of the halls of the Pentagon, to the battlefields in Afghanistan and the civilian production lines.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts in the amount of 450 billion dollars in the coming decade, but now fears that further cuts are needed more by 600 trillion, or if Congress can not make a conclusion in the paper edition.
&quot;The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry,&quot; Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress in achieving a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure would result in 23% overall cuts and a halt to many new projects.
&quot;Done Such a high reduction on such ill-considered way, most of our marine and construction projects would make impossible - you can not buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and hurt other modernization efforts seriously,&quot; said Panetta to Senators.
&quot;We would also be forced to involuntarily separate us from many of our civilian personnel and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would almost certainly be civilians with leave of absence in order to achieve this goal.&quot;
&quot;These changes would destroy the faith of those who will maintain our military and harm our alert seriously.&quot;
The cuts were finally meet the combat troops, &quot;said Panetta.
&quot;During the war time quotas are in the fight against terrorism by the seizure is not directly affected, would be of serious interference with the basic budget, the war effort adversely affect,&quot; Panetta warned.
&quot;Personal settings have to be shortened, which would lead to delays in the settings and adjust supervision, support the war.&quot;
&quot;The salaries of the staff would be reduced, resulting in late payments to dealers and the war would be legal and political support to be disturbed.&quot;
The two senators, Panetta replied 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of the automatic cuts to the Department of Defense.
&quot;The consequences of a seizure of the Defense Department would begin a rapid decline of the United States as the leading military power in the world.&quot;
&quot;We are vehemently against this draconian action,&quot; the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they Panetta&#39;s letter published.
&quot;This is a result with which we can not live, and there is certainly none that we should impose ourselves.&quot;
&quot;The seizure is a threat to national security interests of the United Equip and their occurrence should not be permitted.&quot;
Increase if Panetta&#39;s letter and the new warnings of the senators the pressure to a compromise in the budget or will intensify demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly blunt the possible cuts pronounced, although he was for many years to gain experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the forefront of the Pentagon, and knows that he is serious decisions to.
At a press conference last week in the defense painted a bleak picture of what could lie ahead - with a military shell, but without a core.
&quot;There is a ship without sailors.&quot;
&quot;There is a brigade without ammunition.&quot;
&quot;There is an air force squadron without enough trained pilots.&quot;
&quot;There is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who are able to fulfill the mission,&quot; Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
&quot;It is a force that lacks morality and alert and not in a position to take on potential adversaries.&quot;
&quot;You can be a really angry.&quot;
In an appendix to his letter to McCain and Graham led Panetta to new details, such as creating reductions &quot;significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our use worldwide and Eingreiffähigkeit, resulting in an unacceptable risk to future military operations . &quot;
And Panetta said that some of the largest defense projects could fall victim to the deletion, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
To this list also includes the fighter F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle that require Army and Navy, to replace the Humvee.
If you were to stop further development and testing of the F35, this would save over the next 10 years up to 80 trillion dollars, but proponents say that it is an important next step in the upgrade, so that potential threats from China and other opponents can be dispelled.
How to unmasked a lie
A look at the recent headlines shows how widespread and serious deception and lies far in our daily lives.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain is busy trying to meet the allegations of sexual harassment by several women, sir. Both sides accuse each other of lying.
The line of Penn State is accused of perjury because it has allegedly withheld reports, according to which has abused a retired football coach boys sexually.
In the past week was overheard on an open microphone, as the French President Nicolas Sarkozy the American President Barack Obama asserted against, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York congressman and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he brought denials in circulation, which were very quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violations in campaign financing, which is related to the cover-up an extramarital affair.
And then of course nobody forgets who has experienced it, the media circus, which President Bill Clinton has raised, as he has lied about during his second term in the Oval Office, his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories of cheating in school and college examinations are common.
There were incidents in which teachers have their students exam answers given, so they stood well on their own performance reviews.
Mentors who teach the contrary should send a message that lying and cheating are okay.
How much fraud we are experiencing?
As studies show, we lie every day 10-200 times
Many of these lies are white lies but when.
Another study shows that foreigners are lying to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To detect lies and &quot;expose lies&quot; one, to learn which is important for everyone, and this is both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a board game such as charades away, where it is the goal, &quot;Gotcha!&quot; to call, is a serious deception uncloak a field of knowledge based on scientific data that were collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities, led by the far-reaching research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths were revealed about the lies.
Lies look in your eyes.
They stutter, stammer, blush and fidget not always.
From this one can not but conclude that these liars are difficult to detect and expose.
A skilled Lügenenttarner can penetrate to the truth when he learns something about the structure of the allegation, the subtle facial expressions, making inquiries and timing.
I have spent several years trying to examine the scientific results of the extensive and growing range of unmasking. And it is clear that the uncloak a deception is an advanced skill that is easy to learn and our orientation in our complex world helps, especially when the setting or the questioning of persons or negotiations or administration of their own professional responsibilities include .
Good liars are very good at assessing other people, to arouse their interest and to control their own emotions. And they intuitively feel, how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research, we know, the extroverted people lie more often than introverts, that men often &quot;self-oriented&quot; telling lies than women whose lies &quot;based on other&quot; more - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell, are mostly &quot;fat lies&quot;).
We also know that if a person has been exposed as a wrongdoer, while others feel less guilty for having lied to this person.
How can you tell whether someone is lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of that person.
This is called &quot;baselining&quot; the starting position.
It provides a reference point for future evaluation of changes before.
Observe the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of their subject.
You should know better, when someone trots normally constantly with his foot, so that they do not wrongly accused when he trots during a meeting with his foot.
Then pay attention to striking accumulations of verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these clusters as alarm bells ringing, not as evidence of an unmasking.
People who deceive freeze, perhaps, if they try to remember their history. Maybe their feet pointing towards the door, or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way, or show a &quot;relaxation after the interview,&quot; this deep, relaxing breath and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Questioner often incorrectly indicate that an interview is over, just to keep after this relaxation after the interview on the lookout.
Also watch for the language of your subject.
The slip of Scott Peterson is famous when he used the past tense, as he claimed his wife was dead still alive and sparking a national search for her.
Deceptive persons may also use a distancing language, &quot;I did not have sexual relations with that woman ... Miss Lewinsky&quot; or if you repeat a tricky question as a whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use &quot;qualifying language&quot; when they answer a tricky question: &quot;Well ... to tell you the truth ... as I understand it ... to the best of my knowledge and belief.&quot;
This response is more perceptive than factual, which often set off alarm bells.
There is no magic formula for exposing lies, but you can learn skills that have revealed a possible unmasking.
These capabilities can rarely be any victim of fraud, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan will be revised after an oil pipeline hazards caused by delayed U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which is the union is angry, while environmentalists reassured that the pipeline be built companies trying to plan the project again, so you can return to normalcy.
Trans-Canada said on Monday that it will redirect the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of ​​the Sand Hills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in Parliament House from Nebraska.
Alex said Pourbax Trans Canada that the company was still confident that the pipeline is ultimately approved, albeit with a different course.
This occurred after an announcement by the State Department in the past week, after which would be to postpone a decision on a federal approval for the project was reviewed by the new potential gradient that the area of ​​the Sand Hills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a In large water supply shun.
&quot;This is a real step forward,&quot; said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review, which ordered the State Department may postpone a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision was a matter for the Foreign Ministry and said to his support.
The 1700 Canada-mile pipeline was connected to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To this end, the pipeline would pass through six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets, they love it because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the Nebraska lawmakers who oppose the plan, weigh the laws to force a move away from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the State Department has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but says the source of energy that the home inspector of the Ministry, a separate probe of the review process has requested that focuses on two questions .
One is whether a lobbyist who was hired by Trans Canada, Paul Elliott, who in 2008 was adviser to Hillary Clinton, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that was contracted to conduct the original study, an inappropriate choice, as it was available in conjunction with the Trans Canada.
Patti LaBelle charged because she allegedly a baby for fear compelled to vomit
A New York family claims that the disco-diva Patti LaBelle would have gotten in the lobby of her Manhattan building Tobsuchtanfall one that would have put her little daughter so worried that she has vomited in fear.
The tirade of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that they &quot;personality changes, sleep disturbance&quot; and &quot;increased fear of strangers&quot; was suffering, her family told the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on 10 Last November, when the stagehands Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to leave for a family outing.
During Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk took the luggage and Genevieve in her arms in the lobby of their building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped near the door and placed her daughter for a moment.
&quot;Someone came up behind me and said:&quot; Do you know what your daughter is doing just &quot;I said,&quot; Yes, &quot;and went to her again to take on the arm,&quot; she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman angry.
&quot;She said in an aggressive tone:&quot; You should not stop your daughter near the door, &quot;said Rose Anne Monk.
&quot;I told her:&quot; I do not care what you say or think. &quot;&quot;
She became angry and began to abuse him - she used the F-word and the A-word and was very loud ...
She had a bottle of water in his hand and began to tilt to bottled water for me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
&quot;I said to the woman:&quot; Look what you did with my daughter, &quot;said the mother of the child.
LaBelle rushed to the mother, who always wore Genevieve in her arms, and had by her escort detained and taken to a waiting car to be said Rose Anne Monk.
The baby cried so much that it had passed, she said.
Later, the family asked for an apology in writing LaBelle, but received no response.
Labelle&#39;s attorney and representatives did not respond to calls, which was asked in a statement.
The lawsuit is a unspecified damages, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said he put no fee charged and the family plan, the money that they get to donate to the Children&#39;s Cancer is.
&quot;We want to see Patti LaBelle takes over responsibility for their behavior,&quot; said Davis.
&quot;This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is placed opposite a kindergarten teacher in the day, which carries a 18-month-old baby in her arms.&quot;
Climatic adversities put a brake on economic
In the first year that is Mario López Valdez of the government, rose in Sinaloa, unemployment and illegal work, while the decreased foreign investment and the economy stagnated.
2011 will remain in the economic history of Sinaloa in memory. It is the first year, at which fueled Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and high hopes about economic growth, is in the government. However, due to climatic adversities can be no question, but rather a deterioration of the main economic indicators of growth.
The low temperatures in February, not only caused losses of millions of dollars in agriculture, but put also the growth of the state economy strong boundaries and caused in the first quarter, a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 per cent This is mainly due to the historical degradation of agricultural development to 31.16 percent, which benefited the brakes on further economic sectors.
According to the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (dt Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) report issued on the effects of frost 582 000 hectares were damaged agricultural lands, of which 78.03 percent complete and the remaining 21.07 percent partially were destroyed. This mainly affected the vegetables, corn and chickpea crops.
The decline in economic activity has boosted continuously until November in the Mexican state of unemployment. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed in the first quarter of a rapid rise in unemployment since January-March had 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloa is not employed, which represents 4.53 percent of the workforce. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent from July to September to 6.19 percent, 74 000 unemployed people in Sinaloa with the result. That&#39;s 18 more than 969 people in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa is the year due to several factors. The economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences at the Autonomous University (UAS), commented on the politics of public institutions indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
&quot;What we are seeing now is a rise in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, liquidity, market losses due to cuts in funding by the legislation that was passed to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who illegally amass U.S. dollars, it is not easy to have them work for you to invest it or use it for something else, &quot;he said.
Migration stopped
Lopez Cervantes pointed out that rising unemployment is inherent also a demographic factor.
&quot;The number of people who left the country seeking work abroad, particularly in the United States has decreased. On the one hand stay due to the immigration problems and partly because it is difficult there to find work. These people search here and work here, which in turn increases unemployment, &quot;he says.
Moonlighting
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is even more serious when one considers the high proportion of undeclared work. These include according to INEGI 60.38 percent of the employees in the country who work without pay into the coffers of Social Security.
Unemployment and undeclared work are the low wages, the lowest in Mexico, according to statistics from the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Prevision Social (Government Agency for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa amounted to September 5352 pesos, which is very much less than the national average, which is located at 7375 pesos.
Decline in FDI
Besides the reduction in economic activity and rising unemployment in 2011, the sharpest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) recorded the last ten years. According to the Secretaría de Economía (state economic authority), FDI from January to June totaled $ 630,597, representing a decline of 87.74 percent compared to $ 5,143,312 during the same period last year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Office of Economic Development) turn recorded a total investment of 17.28 million pesos in 2011, is the foremost companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
Given the economic crisis, the government sought in July at the National Congress a loan of three billion pesos, which should be invested for the reactivation of the economy in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities. The National Congress approved an amount of 200.6 million pesos, but could be detected on any of the industries in the country until November no positive effects of debt.
Reactions
For the representatives of the business community was the first year of the reign Mario Lopez Valdes government incompetence obvious.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, president of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformation (State Chamber of manufacturing industry in Mexico) represented that were made in 2011 no effort to harmonize the views of different sectors, including the provincial government.
&quot;Economic activity in Sinaloa was really in this year was very poor. It is necessary to work hard in order to recover this year, lost ground and 2012, we have to work twice. The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the already well coordinated attuned Government teams are not been sufficiently coordinated, &quot;he said.
Slow economic development
Lopez Loredo said that events such as the frost made it difficult at the beginning of the economic development of the country and slowed.
&quot;The small business flow is the result of several events, including the chill. One of the most important impact is a slowing economy that is not enough in motion to produce a dynamic economy, which could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, We finish the year well below our expectations, &quot;he said.
Appeals to redefine
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación de la República Mexicana Patronal (Employers&#39; Association of Mexico) in Sinaloa, said it was necessary to the dynamic state induce productive activities.
&quot;Generally we have found that worked. We believe that it needed a long-term program to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country to develop, for it is to enable important that all physical and human resources, Sinaloa,&quot; he said.
There is plenty to do
The chairman of COPARMEX stressed how important it was to develop a future perspective that guides the efforts of the government in better cars.
&quot;In general I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program,&quot; he said.
He stressed that the current state power have made progress in the government.
&quot;There are areas that can be said regarding the one that the government has acted more comprehensive. What I can say is, that worked and that the government is aware that a lot of work ahead of her,&quot; he said.
8 kg arrest for marijuana
To five years in jail and 100 days a resident of Navolato sentences for possession of eight kilos of marijuana was convicted.
The Prosecutor of the Republic announced the drug retailer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who for an offense against public health - has been punished - in this case for trading possession of marijuana.
According to the Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI Valenzuela Sandoval was born on 7 Junio ​​2010 by Mexican military personnel in monitoring the street Cipriano Valdez against the No. 80 guard in the village of El Castillo, Navolato arrested.

Debt for construction work
The measures provided for in the programs Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos 3x1 and social housing for migrants run the risk of not being completed due to lack of funds, or only with great delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Head of the Municipal Social Development stated that although the construction programs are already well advanced, they float in danger now, as has the State Government to its rightful funds that exceed the three programs 11 million pesos is not paid.
He said the total investment in these three programs amounts to almost 50 million pesos, which fell 25 percent to the state. Until now, only the Federation and the community have contributed to the construction funds, so a delay in the completion of the building was to be expected.
&quot;12 million they need to contribute, and although the year is already over, they have given us a penny, even though they are already in July would have to pay a portion,&quot; he said. &quot;In order not to be late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already well advanced, but we need the money.&quot;
He pointed out that, under the government of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state does not fulfill its obligations, so the community had to take to start his reign of a loan of EUR 7 million. This would correspond to the amount that would have to raise the central government.
&quot;Ran That was us gone in the last legislative period so because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programs continue and this year we had the means procure, who had not applied the state to participate in these programs&quot; , he said.
While government authorities are obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister for Finance and Administration, has been requested to expedite the administrative work and the outstanding equity to pay off as quickly as possible.
&quot;They have to contribute almost 12 million, and although the year is already over, they have given us a penny.&quot;
The court approved in 2015 the transition to digital television in Mexico
The conversion of the analog part to digital signals in recent years world&#39;s most important to the changes.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional challenges that have been by the Senate and the House of Representatives filed against the presidential decree, and by virtue of which the switching can be brought forward from analog to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 must, in the absence of eight votes, which the law challenge requires are back.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was the view of President Felipe Calderon did not exceed his powers when he issued the Legislative Decree providing details of the switchover to terrestrial digital television.
This decision was rejected by the Senate launched constitutional dispute, because he does not have the required qualified majority of eight votes received, so the Court can decide on the constitutionality or the non-constitutionality. The law remains in force.
The project for the lawsuit, which was drafted by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, has been proposed to explain the legislative decree as unconstitutional because of the radio and television concerning regulations, the Comision Federal de Telecomunicaciones (COFETEL) (Federale Telecommunications Commission in Mexico) is responsible, why would contradict the laws decree the hierarchical principles and the laws of reservations.
Voted in favor of the project only Zaldivar, Mario Jorge Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself
This argument submitted both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies constitutional complaints against the laws Decree. Following the adoption of the complaints turned minister Sánchez Cordero, Legislative Decree no longer and stopped all work on the implementation of digital broadcasting.
The Ministers also rejected the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies without debate was about the project, for which also the Minister responsible Sánchez Cordero to enter.
In his speech expressed the prime minister, not with the arguments of the project to agree, in the sense that the provincial government with general rules, the measures taken to regulate public administration, may.
&quot;I do not believe that if we would do that, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected.&quot; She also recalled that for the strategic planning policies, such as the telecommunications sector, with responsibility for constitutional reasons, the central state government, because this directs the affairs of state.
The replacement of analog by digital signals is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it makes better use of the radio-electric spectrum, a higher signal quality and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, she said, a postponement of the usufruct of digitization, which is a decision in the public interest, not only have technical aspects, is &quot;because it encompasses economic, social, political and security aspects.&quot;
These matters, she insisted, &quot;the action of the whole system made necessary, according to the principle of economic management by the government, they included a group of features that put the Constitution into the hands of central governments.&quot;
She called to mind that many countries worldwide, the digital transition have been carried out, through the government, although they possessed highly specialized facilities.
One can not conclude that the government intervene with the publication of the contested decree laws in the powers of Congress, as passed by the legislature laws would be respected, &quot;she assured.

On Wednesday the formation of the new Italian government
Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the President of Italy, to introduce this new government that the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse is to provide the forehead.
Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the President of Italy, to introduce this new government that the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse is to provide the forehead.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that on Sunday named Monti would meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm the formation of the government.
It is assumed that he is a technocrat is mostly present in composite cabinet, although not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of talks with political parties to form a government.
&quot;I want my absolute confidence in the ability to reaffirm our country, with these difficult times to be ready,&quot; said the former EU Commissioner for journalists.
Monti did not confirm explicitly the formation of the government, but from his comments it appears that the obstacles are overcome.
The &quot;frame is now staked out well,&quot; he added.
Monti has managed in less than three days to form a government that is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt in an excessive level.
The new, guided by former Commissioner Monti government must adopt a tough austerity package, which was supported by the Euro politicians to regain confidence in the ailing Italian.
The pressure to rush bearing down on Monticello, was reinforced by the fluctuating market conditions, due to the Italian government bonds for 10 years at 7 percent interest was charged. This corresponds to the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti said: &quot;We said we would support this government for all forces.&quot;
We believe that this government is the last chance to come out of Italy this emergency situation.
The chances of success were Montis by supporting the party of Silvio Berlusconi&#39;s PDL, which on Saturday had to withdraw due to the crisis, increased significantly.
&quot;We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to bring about good results,&quot; said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because until now, many of its members opposed a majority made up of technocrats government, which just makes Monti.
Support by the Parliament
The new government needs a strong parliamentary support Monti for the implementation of the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to his efforts, or postponing the reforms could again result in a devastating attack by the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks performs with his notice, failure Montis was a disaster, also print out.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and employers&#39; associations, as well as youth and women organizations.
Tuesday night is expected to close the round of meetings.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has set in response to the crisis in an extremely fast change of government in motion.
After a brief sigh of relief at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, are due to uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the cost of Italian government bonds again reached critical levels.

Monti said his government had until the next elections to be held probably in 2013, last, in spite of predictions that the politicians will just give him time to implement the reforms, instead of the preferred options.

&quot;In Costa Rica is a dream to play, which is realized&quot;
In the exclusive interview with bassist Jeff Ament says the Viva by Pearl Jam, the band is prepared to give next Sunday at the National Stadium one of her best concerts.
More than 20 years were expected, but assured the band that realized a dream for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This assured the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, were the Viva last week by Brazil in an exclusive interview.
The band is located in the South American part of her tour to celebrate its twentieth anniversary, and on Sunday the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they come from 19.30 clock at the National Stadium in conjunction with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
Read an excerpt from the interview to find the full transcript in the online edition of La Nación&#39;s.
For your Costa Rican fans to realize a dream when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware you what this means for your fans?
Costa Rica is a dream to play, the reality is for us.
This is just the second time that we play in South and Central America, and so far it&#39;s been great.
I&#39;m the only one vacation in Costa Rica have been. It is such a beautiful country that we are still determined to stay there for a few days.
For us it&#39;s exciting to bring our music to go there.
I ask this because the fans of the band are shown completely. Experience the days of intensely before the concert.
What do you say your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you, all these years to stand at our side.
It took almost 21 years before we came to Costa Rica. Thank you for having waited so long to have and we are sorry to take so long before we came here.
Some people even believe that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Does not that a bit of pressure out of your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we have laid in the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.
We played a couple of big shows in Sao Paulo and we hope to have made us ready for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we feel like playing there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are excited by the jungle. For this part of Costa Rica to the best country in the world.
As you&#39;ve come to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends are always down for surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, the areas are excellent for surfing. In this way, about people who love to surf, we have learned from it.
With an eye on the tour with their giant shows have offered many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we are also no limits.
We will try to give the best show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and give our fans a good and varied repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think this is partly so because we have nine boards and play over 120 songs can. Everyone likes a different song, so the decision, which we will play each, is not easy.
If we take two or three songs we have not played for some time, the repertoire, we can focus our better maintained and they surprise us, because we recall the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they might be forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I think that is why for the audience.
This tour will celebrate its twenty years of your history.
If you look back, you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yes, totally.
First of all, I believe that none of us has imagined, to play once in a great rock band, and the long and another 20 years. That seems like a dream.
We continue to follow these blessings and find it great, even now still together to make music.
We like each other and are excited to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to go to the places of the world we wanted to visit ever want.
Things could not be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be among this group of big bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and unusually plentiful, if a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Now and then a band comes out of a city, but it is unusual, if five or ten groups come simultaneously from the same city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes, we always play together yet.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and Soundgarden we saw on their tour. We are pleased to still be friends with them all and we are honored to be part of the Seattle sound that arose.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together for so long with the same musicians.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. That alone is a lot more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive and well we take care of each other.
We are all close friends, why have musical avenues opened, giving everyone the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We could not be better.
Your relationship to fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown, it has made us easy to find a balance.
We make sure not too many times to be on tour, because it is too easy to succumb to this game with huge masses of people who love your music.
As long as one remembers that the people came for the music, you have to remember the fact that you are the music and what she has brought into being sure, not eager to be a famous rock star appeal. That has never interested anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we have very good written songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years, which had until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) never released an album.
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), which are built up with the band and friends. When I hear a song or see pictures, I think that was an incredible man Andy and how he made me laugh. There was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, in particular, have Eddie Vedder and the band therefore chosen for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from multiple groups, and this band we liked best. Therefore, we are curious to see what Las Roberta can offer live. This will definitely exciting.
Why do the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter changes every time you play live?
That&#39;s a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings, and I think he sings the first thing he can think of.
By whom were you influenced as a bass player?
Of so many +
Among the first that come to mind include Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, CJ Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski ...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bass player that I like.
How about Pearl Jam has managed to keep the grunge alive, although it is no longer just a fad?
I think we all do not feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I remember the bands that I&#39;ve mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came up at the same time. Although they are still important today, I think it&#39;s great because it&#39;s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney make better music now than ever before.
At first their music was dark, now it is positive.
Why?
That&#39;s interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the album, something that might seem frivolous. But there are other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in itself.
On both I was in tears when I heard it played like Ed. There are very dark song.
I think when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example if you lose a family member or a friend - affects your music and your artistic work and these two songs represent the clear for me.
However, I also believe that a happy person, and can still make dark music.

Then there are countries that do not all have adopted international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
On a business level has existed since 2004 a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay, which has contributed to an increasing exchange of goods between the two countries.

Squat, were held in the huge parties, was cleared
The homeowner had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building at the street Balmes 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve squatters left the building yesterday afternoon, made no resistance to have.
Everything indicates that the nightmares have found the neighbors of the house No. 51 on the road Balmes an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building yesterday afternoon that they had illegally occupied and organized them into the big festivals that the neighborhood had been driven to despair. The evacuation took place without a court order without police intervention.
After the eviction, the door lock has been changed to avoid a similar situation.
&quot;As of now, the entry will be checked,&quot; confirmed the caretaker.
The squatters who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were occupied - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. In addition, they had painted the walls and leave all kinds of garbage, especially with doses of alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors were held huge parties, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to desperation.
Besides the building there is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damage them.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat told Europa Press that their business would have declined since the beginning of the squat by 80%.
The owner of the nightclub pointed out that the squatters made their unfair competition because they were selling the drinks to three euro, and they cost € 10 at the discotheque.
It was also the owner of the recreational premises of the neighbors complaining about noise were displayed while they claim the noise is not by visitors to the disco stemmed, but by the squatters, and in particular of the guests at the celebrations that were organized there, and, according to the Angry neighbors in recent weeks, more and more.

Park or mountain?
The architects are apart from the arguments about the fees agreed with the tender.
The tender for the city 16 gates opened the debate about the meaning of Collserola in Barcelona again.
Mid-1980s, the height of the now defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the administration published its diatribe on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a giant park in Barcelona.
He was even compared with figures in the Central Park of New York.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park was in the eyes of many back among the upper limit of Barcelona, ​​as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that does not spread into north-south direction, but up (mountains) and bottom ( Sea).
The classification as a nature park Collserolas plays with this idea.
Served as the model no longer the Central Park, but Yellowstone with feral pigs in the role of Yogibärs.
So far it was, as the city in September, a huge call, consisting of 16 contests, spending more for access to gates Collserola.
Undoubtedly, the concept refers to a gate of a park.
Either this is so, or someone who intends to make gates to the country.
The question is obvious: Collserola, park or mountain?
The tender is not only from an organizational point of view but also in terms of a reflection on the city the talk of the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It&#39;s been almost a recurrent theme, the two members of this long-established caste, who meet in the elevator to fall back, can.
And this very fact the material provides for one of the few similarities between what to think about three architects from Barcelona, ​​and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel and Marta Modol Bayona: The contract is appropriate.
For Roldán &quot;it is necessary&quot; to speak after the attack on the coast of the &quot;front on the mountains&quot;, as far as the discourse of Ildefonso Cerda, who over the green apples, is not been held.
&quot;We should proceed from the principle that Barcelona&#39;s largest park, the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex, &quot;says the architect, for the title&quot; &quot;contains within itself: it must not be&quot; gates of Collserola &quot;a&quot; lexical case of as entrances to a park, but as a restriction of areas to act on those needs. &quot;
Modol as Roldan and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as an &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; that &quot;some risks&quot; conceals within itself.
Risks posed by the &quot;uncertainty that the design of a public space brings with it these days&quot; after the experience of the 1980s, in the area of ​​the Forum had their &quot;swan song&quot;.
The first concern is their own limit to what can be built.
&quot;Something always does narrow to determine the next step&quot;, ie going over.
&quot;You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the present [referring to the General Plan, Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster.&quot;
Modol who consider themselves more closely to the question says simplify, the site of Collserola that goes in the direction Vallesana, &quot;can be understood as a park, not in the direction of Barcelona&quot;, and this for purely topographical reasons.
Modol reminded that there is already a degree of patronage de Collserola that is not &quot;should fall on deaf ears,&quot; although he was the city administration thankful that she has given his body the way &quot;from the first moment&quot; in this project participate.
He also noted that the proximity of the mountains to the city of safe conduct, which allows architects to participate in the debate, although his &quot;doubt&quot; statement as to whether this technical profile which launched multi-disciplinary teams (&quot;exactly the right, &quot;he says) should instruct&quot; We architects should only be a tool. &quot;
Bayona suggests that the answer is complex to the question in the title of this article, as lacking in the tender conditions, a global view of Collserola: &quot;There have been tendered 16 competitions in cross section,&quot; he says, &quot;on the axis of the mountains, the sea. But there are no longitudinal perspective, which views the region as a whole. &quot;
This has, at least in his case meant that he participates in the 16 contests.
Otherwise the program and the definition of a project for a gate with the architects of the gate next to it would collide.
In his opinion the city should guarantee absolutely that the strips directly on the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length so equipped, the result is a smoother transition between urban and green areas.

It is possible that the team was selected because of the clouds, a lower area with a better view towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Point of impact:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter are the same. Perhaps there has been no impact from the loss of control of the aircraft nor a deviation from the flight path.
Dispersal of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The available information to date suggests that the helicopter straight and lateral direction was bounced.
The pattern of the plane scattered remnants suggest that the helicopter was bounced with its intact structure on the ground.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft at the accident site can offer neither fire nor with explosive.
The last survey results indicate several surface contacts.
The investigations on the spot aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is steep and has a skew of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is gone likely to break.
Some data indicate that the helicopter could have had several contacts the ground.
After a thorough search on an area that went beyond the roped-off area at the scene could not be found scattered aircraft parts, which reinforces the assumption that the structure was intact plane slammed into the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to locate the gene for obesity
She leads a Mexican Social Security Institute research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, which is supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexican Social Security Institute) announced that it directs a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title &quot;Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth,&quot; with which the genetic markers associated found to be overweight.
Miguel Cruz Lopez, leader of the Unidad de Investigación Médica s Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, specializing in Biochemistry) at the Hospital Clinic de Especialidades del Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, said that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers set up was.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate program at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Advanced Studies (CINVESTAV) del Instituto Nacional Politécnico (IPN).
The public is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday will be conducted from 8:00 clock tests with children and adolescents.
He stressed that the investigation began on the sports field of Cuauhtemoc (west of the State of Mexico) and since 8 Will continue in October on the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (east of the State of Mexico).
If the goal is reached 500-600 study subjects, the study is on the sports field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and continued on the Morelos (in the north of the capital district) completed.
He explained that the purpose of this study was to learn about the factors and the role of genetics in conjunction with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
To mark the world day of diabetes, he said it would strive to represent three thousand children and teenagers between the ages of six and should complete 14 years with the consent and under the supervision of their parents&#39; nutritional questionnaires.
You are also asked questions about their physical activity and their family medical history to risk factors, diabetes or renal failure could result in control.
He stated further, measured to the mentioned Saturday, the study subjects (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure checks and blood tests such as glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes associated with obesity in childhood ) were determined.
Cruz Lopez emphasized that this investigation would be carried out at the concerns of health professionals about the alarming increase in weight of young people.
&quot;Resulted in the health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 that was in almost six years has increased the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 per cent of the girls with obesity by 47 percent. The obesity had increased dramatically,&quot; said the specialist, the IMSS.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified, because the genetic history of the Mexican population differences from that of other nations.
He stated that a (n) Mexicans (in) was on average 65 percent of Indian-American, 30 percent European and 5 percent of African descent, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity in the context .
More generally, he said, the genetics of obesity push in the inability to burn the excess of taken us energy (calories) from, so this will be stored as fat.
The researchers explained that the direct benefits for the study participants would be in a comprehensive study of the children, would be found in whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even investigated the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and inside arms (acanthosis), indicating the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the preliminary stage.
All information was kept confidential and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to parents all the measurement results and beat them in front of lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz Lopez said that there were three basic factors that are responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases, sedentary lifestyle, which means lack of movement in everyday life that most of the day to spend watching television and use of transport, rather than short distances to feet to go.
The high caloric intake, that is, an increased consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) along with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics that will be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from the UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico UNAM developed with polymer modified asphalt, the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and compared to temperature fluctuations
If the signs emanating from the pavement, respected, it would not be required to repair almost 200 000 potholes when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of ​​the Valley of Mexico) erupts, said to Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University UNAM, warning and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the asphalt pavement geschähe appropriate to reduce the number of potholes significantly or even completely avoided.
In his lecture &quot;potholes from a technical point of view,&quot; he occasion was the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, with polymer-modified asphalts develop to create a the asphalt-like mixture, but greater mechanical resistance both at high and at low temperatures has.
Nájera Herrera said that this kind of modified asphalts in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some northern cities in the country, should be used to improve the behavior of the pavement and thus to avoid the occurrence of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the hardest part of the oil - a hydrocarbon compound, is a part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphaltenes - and the other part is a low - the so-called Malthene. Together they give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
Viscoelastic behavior of asphalt means that this is at high temperatures close to 180 ° C behaves like a liquid at 120 ° C, it is very viscous and fixed at 50 ° C, almost, as it is brittle at low temperatures.
&quot;This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but varies on a day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations&quot;, said the chemical engineer.
The researchers noted the FQ, the streets of Mexico City had a majority of a flexible pavement, which is composed is composed of six layers of materials, which included the last three asphalt.
Between the upper layers of lies, a wear layer of asphalt, which drenched from small, then there is solidified in asphalt and stones.
Each one of these stones wear layer, had been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles are to move and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the pavement.
&quot;If it was modified asphalt, the forces would spread out even better,&quot; said the chemical engineer.
&quot;On the wear layer,&quot; he explained, &quot;a final coat is laid, the so-called base layer, which consists of tiny stones, ie sand, which was bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with vehicle tires, they need a greater mechanical strength than the wear layer and they must produce friction.
On this road surface most forces receives and distributes the base course also requires an adequate thickness and the material of which it consists, shall be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations are more important factors to consider, especially the water, &quot;he said,&quot; because it affects the behavior of the wear layer significantly.
If the ground is wet, water enters into the film and appears only in hard back. This causes a weakening of all layers of the pavement and consequently the occurrence of potholes.
If a pothole is formed, &quot;he said,&quot; is first removed the top layer, while the wear layer will only affect it. But the damage is not immediate, but it is a process that should be maintained at the first sign of appropriate maintenance programs. &quot;
The member of the Sistema Nacional de investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) said that the vehicle load is another important reason for the occurrence of potholes. Therefore crucial that the thickness of each layer of the pavement always be in proportion to vehicle load and the need to ensure that compliance is the avoidance of many potholes this regulation.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research projects were slow in coming, for example, on asphalt emulsions that are in other countries is even already on the market, and where the potholes were repaired easily and without using high temperatures.
What was missing the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected that Melina Ramirez Serna, the crown of Miss Colombia did not get.
El Valle receives his 14th Miss title.
Once again went blank from Valle del Cauca in the awarding of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content to stand on the winners podium, a silver crown and the band that identifies them as the new Miss Colombia, to make a show.
By that night result obtained in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico the crown and the cedar was in itself, the department is already at 14 Miss title and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, which held the crown almost in the hands had. The proclaimed Misses include: Miriam Benoit Ospina (1947), Clara Borrero Dominguez (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rosemary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque ( 1988), Mónica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Aljure Garcés (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many ask today is: What was missing?
Because the result is the demise of a great favorite, who had shown at each screening, they had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing was she the queen of the police and Mejor Rostro Jolie was chosen by Vogue, title, and the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia at home.
The first factor that is considered critical to the decision of the jury to nominate them for the first miss, is that they are the answer to the question &quot;What book has influenced you most and why?&quot; To it by Martín Gómez of Murillo been made of the Carreta Literaria Leamos was, had not convinced.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
&quot;I read a lot, I think pretty much in the literature, I think it&#39;s a way to civilize themselves, ultimately I think that the book that shaped my childhood for most, &#39;The Little Prince&#39; is a very deep book.
At the moment I read &#39;Crime and Punishment&#39;. It is a book of universal culture, which we should all read. I&#39;m reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian woman, a beautiful book that `Leidenschaften&#39;heißt.
One answer, which met with little approval, firstly because of the term `to zivilisieren&#39;und secondly, because they had not specifically stated, had influenced the way in which each of her book, she said.
But after the ceremony, Melina, to feel calm and happy with the result: &quot;The universe is as it happens, what needs to happen.
And for all people: Please read a bit of `The Little Prince &#39;. It is a great book.
Among other things, is said to be the darling of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the preferred, which reaped all Beifälle and had received in advance all prices (catering competition Easter, public vote on the best-made visual costume and Reina Madre), &quot;the other candidates had been jealous, what stresste the Queen, who therefore could not shine on stage. &quot;
And you could see in her first performance in swimsuit at the beach of the Hilton Hotel and its two elevators at the coronation ceremony.
Although they both appeared safe, but she lacked the strength and momentum that featured representatives from the Magdalena and Atlántico on display.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the &quot;Como en Casa&quot; for channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, &quot;shows that the candidate who wins the most awards during the competition, but not finally becomes queen.&quot;
In addition, Valle went to the end of the press out of the way - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that the Jury regarding Valle convince her interest in social work could not understand what is ultimately the essence of the national beauty contest.
It&#39;ll have a reason, said that two days prior to the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty, they were looking for a woman who dedicated herself to the social affairs of their country.
&quot;Beauty alone for Miss Colombia is not enough. One must also look beyond the physical and focus on the social sense, that they had worked before entering the competition on projects,&quot; she said.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with their defects in the derriere and fibrosis, which is noted in her stomach. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose as a candidate for &#39;natural beauty&#39; with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work.
The coach of the Queens, Jorge Hernan Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body that there are better there, &quot;but their problem was with the fibrosis of the abdomen, for me to be honest hardly noticeable, their scores expressed on the last Day. &quot;
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the journal Cromos of view, the problem of women from Valle del Cauca, the surgical intervention, which they had subjected themselves were.
&quot;The operations are ok, but Valle did not know how they should let them do it right.
Her body has never been her strong suit, and that body had to pay them. &quot;
Because of this award, the first awarded by the National Beauty Contest, created after the show in a bathing suit is a cruel prediction that should be true at night. It was whispered that Raymundo Melina had been a consolation prize, so as not to have come to enjoy the crown.
Whether that&#39;s true or not, the fact is that Melina today takes up her reign year, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers them the opportunity to appoint the National Pageant Colombia in an international competition to represent .
However, they will go down as one of the queens, who had escaped, despite their overwhelming presence of the crown in Cartagena, in the story.
Such was the work of the doctor who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoskopist from Cali emerged as the man who &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;, identified in the story.
The work of these officials play a key role.
On 4 November was a Lophoskopist the determination unit of prosecution (CTI) from Cali as the man of the identity of the leader of the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) confirmed one, &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot; by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the Department of CTI, this week Eliazar Gonzalez-call service, a man in Puerto Tejada had a collaborator for 21 years in criminal investigations.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez has worked in communities of Chocó, where he had to go frequently for five days in the jungle to reach the place where the bodies were located, he should identify.
In 2000 he moved to Valle on and after the completion of required courses, he specialized in Lophoskopie, which is the study of the skin that is exposed to friction, ie the palms and soles.
The week of action against the so-called Alfonso Cano Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he flew by helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew he should identify two corpses, and that it was suspected that might be one of the man who is the oldest guerrilla who led the world. Therefore, he should take the ten finger-print of Guillermo León Sáenz sheet (his real name).
But when he reached the place with the Untersuchungste where was the corpse, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this was similar to figures he had seen in the mass media, not in the least.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, did not wear glasses and was very much thinner.
But fingerprints do not lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a trowel and a flashlight Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse as that on the print sheet.
He had been right: it was &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;.
Still the same night was the native of Puerto Tejada man responsible for the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón tell that it was indeed the leader of the FARC.
Looking for clues
For a Daktyloskopen Sijin from Cali was the appreciation that the President Juan Manuel Santos Gonzalez Eliazar at a press conference on the use to &quot;Cano&quot; they bestowed, very important.
Many people do not know our work.
The fingerprinting is an exact science without errors, which can be a key factor in the reversal of a criminal offense.
Lophoskopisten identify not only dead bodies, they also assist investigations into murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
With their arrest, put many criminals with false identity papers, or they have none.
We take them off the fingerprints and looking them in the database.
The researchers told us that he had stolen a piece of crack in a wall of a house had to be propped up because the thief at this very spot with his hand as he drew out a stuffed with jewelery and cash safe.
&quot;Walls are difficult because their surfaces are not suitable for fingerprinting are. But in this case, we were able to take the imprint of the whole hand and the offenders who had participated in several thefts identify,&quot; he recalled.
Fingerprints can also use the murder suspects are released or charged.
Recently, a dead body was found surrounded by liquor bottles.
In the determination has been suggested that a family member could be A suspect, and actually voted a fingerprint match on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, he is still the place where the offense was committed, taken in context.
A Daktyloskopist the CTI stated that &quot;the fingerprints of chemical or physical reagents were taken from the object.&quot;
When they appear, a trowel or a tape is used for the taking.
After the prints are sent to the Asif, that is the criminal database, or to the Civil Status Office.
&quot;The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,&quot; the expert explained by the CTI.
He said that not everything is as it was depicted in the TV series SCI.
Just as all is not gold that glitters, is not all that it touches a fingerprint.
But still it can be used when performing an appropriate comparison.
The &quot;outraged&quot; challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded together in tents on the Square Zuccotti.
The majority came after the eviction order and moved its location in a nearby park
The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street challenged this Tuesday, the authorities of New York, as she once again with a court order sought to enter the Manhattan court, after they were evicted at dawn from the place and had tried a different place on to occupy the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters crowded together in front of the Zuccotti Square, to which they relate with a court order that allowed the &quot;outraged&quot; the new tents at this point wanted to gain entry. Meanwhile, another part was the movement of the eviction order and occupied a park north of the city, where there were nine arrests.
&quot;Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp out on the pitch, we together can find us in another place and continue the battle with the legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,&quot; said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the movement &quot;Ocupy Wall Street.&quot;
Bray explained that the response of the &quot;outraged&quot; at the evacuation of their tent camp that had been ordered directly from Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York until trial came when the judge Lucy Billings spent an arrangement that the forcible eviction of the course and approved the ban protesters camping.
Also occupying the &quot;outraged&quot; a new park that is centrally located at the intersection of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, all located near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the property of Trinity Church is.
They were able to occupy the premises at least one hour. But then the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray can be no exact figures. He assured the news agency Efe that he had seen among several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assured there would be hundreds of people gathered at this point, where a delegation of religious leaders had arrived to show their support of the members of the movement and to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the remains Zuccotti-place (a site in private ownership) is closed pending a court hearing, which is still scheduled for this Tuesday, and in which the legality of the eviction took place at dawn to be analyzed.
Some of the protesters were driven from place photocopies of court order with them and they dispersed. She even gave some policemen who guarded the place that &quot;some small clashes&quot; with the result reported as Bray, who had shown some police officers had beaten protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities, members of Occupy Wall Street to vacate the place and the application of &quot;laws that were adopted after the occupation and to prevent the demonstrators with their tents and other things that they had used before, return to the park. &quot;
Mayor Bloomberg makes it clear to the press that this was because of this court order the reopening of the square to the public and the protesters were removed. The protesters, he pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish with tents and sleeping bags at this location.
The mayor defended himself in the dawn of the eviction carried out Zuccotti Square, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and the decision because the protesters &quot;against the law violated.&quot; Was
Bloomberg said he had given the order to evacuate the place, because the latter &quot;had turned into a place where people came not to demonstrate, but for breaking the law and in some cases, to other people harm,&quot; because &quot;Some businesses have received threats,&quot; and residents were worried &quot;about their quality of life.&quot;
&quot;The evacuation in the morning was disgusting, and shows that Bloomberg actually in the protection of financial interests and not on protecting the interests of the American worker is interested,&quot; added the spokesman of the movement, the anschuldigte the mayor &quot;not to respect the freedom of the press&quot;.
The charge of &quot;Occupy Wall Street&quot; informed that they nachdächten about &quot;big action&quot; on Thursday to organize, together with community organizations and trade unions to the two months that the protests since the 17th September now have been going to remember.
Pamela Anderson is in the TV Christmas show the Virgin Mary
Together with Michael Buble and other Canadian celebrities she is on 1 December in the TV program &quot;It&#39;s a Russell Peters Christmas&quot; occur
The Canadian Pamela Anderson, Tim Allen&#39;s assistant in &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, a lifeguard in &#39;Baywatch&#39; rabbit in &quot;Playboy&quot;, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model at a Christmas show on the Canadian television, the Virgin Mary to be.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the &quot;crooner&quot; (ballad singer) Michael Buble and other Canadian celebrities on 1 December in the TV program &quot;It&#39;s a Russell Peters Christmas&quot; experience and a very special Virgin Mary will breathe life into.
CTV popular today pictures of the television program, in which Anderson - who also for dissemination on the Internet a self-made porn, in which she appears with her former husband, the drummer of &quot;Motley Crue&quot; Tommy Lee - as the Virgin Mary with should represent a doll in her lap, Jesus appears.
The scene is Peter, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently worked as a presenter on the show &quot;My Violent Torpedo of Truth&quot; by Charlie Sheen, as the baby Jesus.
The Christmas program of CTV relies not only on Anderson and Peters, also married on the Canadian singer Bublé, the end of March in Buenos Aires, the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and this controversy is not far away.
Bublé was recently at one of his concerts in New York, the North American Kim Kardashian called a &quot;whore&quot;.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and end the spiral of the free fall in early March
Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, which is still in recovery after the devastating earthquake that lead onto a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that Japan is the second World War I had experienced.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo assessed the damage at $ 300,000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult global economic situation.
After enduring three quarters if the information were used to gross domestic product from July to September to finally close this chapter: the GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and up 6% on the grossed-up to this year&#39;s quota.
The measured value in the second quarter - in Japan begins the fiscal year in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained partly by the sale of machines for the reconstruction of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami which devastated areas.
In fact, the company increased its investment by 1.1% compared to a decline of 0.9% for investments that have been recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual change in the Japanese economy is not based exclusively Keynesian impulses that use the crisis to build infrastructure or build new.
Woke up, Japan is mainly due to the development of domestic consumption, which now represents 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, triggered by the increasing expenditure on cars, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market after the Yen - Japanese currency - in one of the &quot;haven currencies,&quot; the investors who are fleeing from the debt crisis of the euro area and the gloomy forecasts for the United States, a privilege that such a grave stone in the accounts exporting firms busy.
With a harder currency abroad, the products are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is on the health of large technology based producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, traced their weak operating results from July to September, the listing of the yen.
While the markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the government remains vigilant Yoshihiko Noda.
&quot;We must pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,&quot; yesterday said the State Secretary of Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are not really very exhilarating.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that most member states have been clearer in September showed signs of a slowdown in economic development.
The indicator anticipates the turning points of the world economy, brought to light that would be pulled in the biggest economic powers of the brake.
Because he fell four-tenths to go to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro zone is even lower than this average, which stands at 100 after it has fallen by eight tenths of 99.13 points.
Athens again raises doubts
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign an agreement in writing
With driven by soaring risk premiums of the peripheral countries and wide-giving uncertainty to continue Greece lost in the maze that leads out of the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new Greek government more of a transition in response to pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces, is slowly covered by the facts.
While the new prime minister, Luke Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the agreed upon when he was appointed one hundred days were possibly too short for their implementation, assured the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, that He supported the new austerity measures and not his call new elections to the scheduled date, the 19th February to take back will.
&quot;The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit of 26 October,&quot; Papadimos assured yesterday the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will tomorrow be reached by a vote of confidence for the new government its peak.
A package of 24 programs to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samaras concedes release the doubts about his attitude is not enough: &quot;We pledge to support the transitional government, but otherwise nothing.&quot;
The Conservative leader went a step too far do with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that the 8000 millions who desperately needed to unlock Athens. He stated that he would approve any pledge of the fulfillment of the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is due to the impact of the poker game with Papandreou referendum or irritated always reiterated again yesterday, was at her request not to shake: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the major Greek parties, &quot;a unambiguous written agreement would not be signed as soon as possible. &quot;
The spokesman for the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the troika &quot;very soon&quot; came back to Athens to discuss with the new government, &quot;which for the payment of the sixth paragraph&quot; in the amount of 8,000 million euros, &quot;needed was&quot; although there is still no definite date.
The Greek ball has threads for a while.
Queen Sofia: &quot;These are instruments of progress and hope&quot;
The queen stressed the &quot;dominant&quot; position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain &quot;has a dominant position worldwide in the role of micro finance reached&quot;.
The Queen Sofia of Spain recalled yesterday the fact that Spain has developed worldwide in the last two decades, the second donor for this means of international cooperation. Its &quot;essence&quot; based on the fact that it is an &quot;instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity on the basis of trust in the human form&quot;.
The queen officially opened yesterday, a fifth World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there is &quot;no doubt&quot; would be that this type of transaction &quot;absolutely essential&quot; would be to achieve the United Nations by 2015 ambitious Millennium Development Goals and &quot;in particular the goal, the number of people with incomes live on less than a dollar a day have to say below the &quot;poverty line&quot;.
Spain &quot;continues to work&quot; in the expansion of the favored network &quot;until the last corner of the world and this task will responsibly through,&quot; said the Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions from the summit, to Thursday takes to go out, &quot;the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and most especially for women&quot; as the main beneficiaries of these loans are guaranteed.
&quot;We have seen many successes&quot; and &quot;are facing many challenges.&quot;
The Summit on Microcredit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for the offense of &quot;two fundamental objectives.&quot;
The Queen said it would aim to have up to the end of the year 2015 175 million poor families access to financial services, and that ten million of these households will exceed the poverty line.
The concept of micro-credit goes to Spain and the rest of the world by Muhammad Yunus, &quot;years ago initiated way&quot; back to the judges the Queen Sofia as an &quot;act of justice and recognition.&quot;
The father of this financing instrument he describes as an &quot;admirable idealists who have dedicated themselves to the fight against poverty&quot; and whose work they&#39;ve known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about the lending strategy on the spot.
That experience followed a year later, the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings in the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. Have at all &quot;we can observe a continuous evolution,&quot; said the queen, whose commitment to this project brought her yesterday to assess the &quot;family head&quot; in Valladolid and &quot;advocate for the poor.&quot;
Finally finished the Queen Sofia in their delivery, by those present to participate in the debate and search for solutions in the fight against poverty animated.
&quot;Ethical bid&quot;
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez pointed out that solidarity &quot;an ethical imperative&quot; for the entire state is democratic.
In this sense, it emphasized that it was a mistake to aid in times of economic boom bind, because if it were a &quot;lasting commitment&quot;.
Jiménez was believed that the micro-credit &quot;is a serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty &#39;means, and that the governments of industrialized countries are now&quot; more than ever &quot;to work for solidarity criteria should, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis victim falls.
For Spain, the micro-credit is one of the &quot;most important forms of development aid &#39;.

The CDU is proposing to elect the EU president because of general voting
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the program, but has prevailed in the fall, especially to those activists do enough to assess the government&#39;s policy with regard to the Greeks in Italy today and tomorrow may be too lax.
The proposed presidential request by the Bureau of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Below 1001 delegates had voted the other hand, only nine, ten had to abstain.
The standing ovation lasting several minutes, which were initially due to their Interventionserlässen Angela Merkel as well as a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble lieβen, part of the three pan-European leanings of Finance openly no doubt.
The main idea of ​​the Chancellor bears - as well as the Antrage - following slogan: the answer to the crisis is &quot;not less but more Europe.&quot;
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because &quot;nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro&quot;.
For the Chancellor, &quot;the time for a breakthrough came in Europe&quot; is.
This could occur through the control of the European Union empowering modification of the Lisbon Treaty as regards the policy of the countries in the euro zone expressed, as it could, however, in the election of the president lead the European Commission based on general voting &quot;to make Europe a face to &quot;give.
However, this is definitely one of the application proposals adopted by Congress, which was clearly Wolfgang Schäuble Godfather.
Certainly there is little likely that the 47 to agree quickly on this revolution: Large-Britain is hostile to the cause, and to know the managers of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
The milestone has been laid.
Similarly, the delegates have an overwhelming majority rejected the proposal of the weighting of each country in the Governing Board in accordance with the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously would result in a strengthening of the position of Germany with him.
The calm on the climate within their party thoughtful Chancellor has, therefore, the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl reinforced. However, she no longer tries to win their conference at the expense of &quot;small&quot; or to the European countries in difficulties, which would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
Unless the request of the European importance of the &quot;Franco-German friendship,&quot; devotes a paragraph, calls Angela Merkel, France is not on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because it points out that Leipzig was two centuries ago in the center of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the supremely humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What the fraud represented in sick leave?
According to family allowances take UMP and now the government health messages addressed.
Nicolas Sarkozy on Tuesday, 15 November arriving in Bordeaux to go to a family allowance fund and a speech about that - since 2007 recurring - theme of struggle against social fraud and economic dependence on the state to make.
To accompany the attack that originates from the desire to subject the economy in a hardness test, on the other hand, however, is no less a harbinger of an axis of the right presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on worker absenteeism.
First, with household economic goals: the government is targeting the launch of a fourth day leave before consideration of a sick leave among workers in the private sector.
In German well, this means that a sick employee would lose without specific authorization from the company to pay for four days, so therefore at least 15% of his monthly income.
A Maβnahme, quoted by the daily &quot;Les Echos&quot; threatens to evoke anger, but would help to bring in 280 million euros.
And the other with a more symbolic character Maβnahme would go along: the state officials to give an uncoated waiting period in case of illness (so far there is to it, in contrast to the three waiting days in the private sector, no waiting period).
Meanwhile, these issues are under discussion, the majority also sparked anew the issue of fraud, is being targeted at the time of absence from work related abuse.
&quot;Checks will be much more important, and beyond these rückzuvergüten, if required,&quot; warned Xavier Bertrand on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the station RTL.
As in other cases, the impact of this release regarding the reality of fraud in the areas of health messages out of proportion a little.
This is, in fact, since 2002 the subject of constant observation, as well as political campaigns, which have borne the most fruit.
The French are no longer sick more often than people elsewhere in Europe.
Let us, however, initially at the national numbers.
According to the National Health Insurance CNAM in 2006 were paid more than 237 million euros days severance pay.
Pursuant to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health presented the daily settlements in 2008 with 11.3 billion euros dar. 5% of health spending
Under this amount fell about 46% of maternity leave and work-related accidents and 54% concerning sick leave, witch means 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore, 2.5% health care spending.
In 2010 the French against the 17.8 days in 2009 were granted on average, according to a study of Alma Consulting Group only 14.5 sick days.
An average of some differences glossed over: another was, in 2007 by Monster.com, site for career planning, publishing, pointed out that 75% of the 40th 000 respondents, French employees stated that they had taken no sick days only.
Another, recorded this time by the health insurance study makes clear that 37% of sick days were in 2010, of shorter duration than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% higher.
Compared with its European neighbors, the French workers tend not to work more than elsewhere disability.
One in 2010 by two researchers from the French, governmental Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) longitudinal study showed that between 1994 and 2001 overall absence rate (illness or justified otherwise) oscillated, in France between 10% and 11% against 20 % and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The sick leave fraud is a very small proportion in terms of moonlighting dar.
Regarding the fraud is only a weak Ausmaβ achieved.
The reinforcement of the legislation since 2002, brings with it, that there is systmatische controls on sick leave in excess of 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public education for education and training of technicians and engineers) found less than 1.5 million checks that 13% of 285 000 of realized short-term sick leave, witch means in 37 050 cases of &quot;unfair or too long&quot; were.
In the cases systematically controlled sick leave of more than 45 days duration were counted under 1.2 million 11% of &quot;non-conformist or unjustifiable&quot; cases, witch means 132,000.
Altogether, this makes 169 000 &quot;unjustified&quot; attacks on millions of workers who have made a sick leave claim.
A number that represents only a weak Ausmaβ compared, for example those of the black economy.
According to the UMP deputy Dominique Tian, ​​author of a July released property report with regard to this question, this is 9 to 15 billion euros in tax loss of profits is per year, or more than the total cost of daily allowances, and so much more than the defraudation at last.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new accommodation plan
Greece has a new customization program for intercepting its economy needed.
This was announced on Monday, 14 November, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament Attaching the fact that his government from the Union granted one hundred days is not sufficient to do the job.
&quot;To continue the efforts towards strengthening the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new program of budget adjustment,&quot; the Prime Minister said in his first public speech at the Opening of the debate on the confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the occasion of the Summit on 27 € Decisions made in October was the &quot;main task&quot; of the new government, since the participation of the country within the euro zone &quot;at stake&quot; would, he added.
According to M. Papademos has planned to reduce the government deficit of the country &quot;to the 9%&quot; of gross domestic product from today until the end of the year after it was in 2010 and 10.6% in 2009 to 15.7%.
The rights rejects the new Sparmaβnahmen
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had on Monday announced its approval to the already approved regarding a Maβnahmen the escape from the debt crisis serving attempt, however, anticipated that his party would not be ready AMY GOODMAN: Explain to an additional Sparmaβnahme.
&quot;We will not vote in favor of new Maβnahmen,&quot; he said during a meeting of his party New Democracy MPs.
He agrees with the requirements of the reduction of fiscal deficit and debt, as well as the fight against waste, however, was hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, with economic and monetary tasks entrusted EU commissioner, who had prevented the IMF and the EU is not the necessary loan of 8 billion euros to release without the written guarantee of all parties on whose support the planned Maβnahmen had answered Antonio Samaras, that his word enough and he would sign anything under pressure from Auβen.
Euthanasia and suicide should be legalized accompanied, according to a panel of experts
The Canadians are living in denial of death, as appears from a report of the Royal Society of Canada
The Panel stated that governments, health care institutions and physicians working together with regard to pain relief treatment for the best pain reliever to provide, and this is also going well on the cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a negative attitude toward death.
Only 9% of Canadians can actually be one to talk to their doctors about conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, where six experts were involved, which in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine, are linked.
This committee recommends the Government to amend the Criminal Code so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this choice is, and on patients who are considered able to make such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts cite a recent survey by the independent company EIU that had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe together.
Although Canada is here on the 10th Rank has placed the study noted that &quot;death is the medical care in Canada produced a culture in which people are afraid to broach the subject of death.&quot;
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians reported no access to painkillers, we may exercise by the Royal Society of Canada appointed experts.
And despite the majority of Canadians wish to die at home, but ultimately 68.6% of those dying in hospital.
Viewed from across the country establish the rate of 86% of hospital deaths that occurred in Quebec is the highest.
In the sensitive issue regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide are the authors of the report conclusions to the position of the federal government, which has already geäuβert to want to make any changes to the criminal law regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide are oppositely directed.
Are now but according to experts, the gleichermaβen all those countries inspected, have their approach to euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized or decriminalized, no evidence that such decriminalization Miβbräuche in their application, so the practical implementation of euthanasia or assisted suicide of incompetent or non-consenting persons would entail.
On the contrary, they encounter many more cases of such violations in the countries where euthanasia and suicide are not accompanied legalized, like yesterday, Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference.
&quot;Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.&quot;
&quot;Also accompanied suicide is practiced in Canada, although this clearly illegal,&quot; said Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Let us recall that in 2010, according to an Angus Reid conducted survey, 85% of Canadians had geäuβert favor of euthanasia, because they are of the opinion that it allows people at the end of their life cycle, to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the issue of legalization of euthanasia did not mean to convey the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people besäβe less value.
With regard to persons who have already practiced an assisted suicide, which represented 41% of respondents considered that these should not be prosecuted.
As for maintenance or adjustment of the means for patients is to situation is less clear, the author of the report.
Also near this place in their list of recommendations that should be specified in the Penal Code, that the withdrawal of funds for a legal opposition had been submitted should not be considered as criminal.
The expert panel urges, moreover, that the health care professionals should be trained in the task to respect the cessation of funds at the end of life, and this without fear of criminal prosecution to have.
The Panel stated that governments, health care institutions and physicians working together with regard to analgesic treatment in order to provide the best pain reliever available, and this is also going well on the cancer cases.
Finally, the committee calls regarding the Canadian back in the institutions of health care widely applied means to relieve pain or lebensabschlieβender measures that could drag them to at least consider, as they nor euthanasia were used to reduce physical pain, they referred to the same procedures .
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the legal field of health care have already raised concerns about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, the attitude of the undersigned expert report has among other things as &quot;extreme&quot; because they put the practice of euthanasia for patients in the final stages of any boundaries.
&quot;This opens the doors for a situation in which everyone who is tired of life and older than 18 years to ask another person to him in his suicide help,&quot; said RA Deschamps, who yesterday had looked through a summary of the report .
RA Deschamps also emphasizes the report&#39;s authors seemed responsibility of the individual to rise above all other values, which are involved in social knitted fabric of the society.
But now, he says there are &quot;guidelines and obligations in a society.&quot;
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, also has &quot;strong resistance&quot; to the conclusions of the report expressed that they dubbed as &quot;pro-euthanasia-manifest&quot;.
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada questioned, particularly with regard to the report details the non-existence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia is legalized and accompanied suicide, such as the Netherlands and in Oregon.

Noda threatened with a new intervention in currency markets

The Italian and Spanish rates are far below the 6% limit.
The loan interest rates in Italy and Spain are still at a very alarming level.
On Tuesday morning reached the yield on the Italian bonds to 10 years 6.85%, that of the title Spanish matured to 6.2%.
This stresses the interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, nourish still the fears of investors.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti called one of the markets more time to the paralysis of the debt situation in Italy threatened to restore.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos was in turn confirmed the implementation of on the occasion of the 27th October summit meeting of the Euro-zone decisions were &quot;the main task&quot; of his government.
Spain is located in the visor of markets, as taking place on Sunday the parliamentary elections in the country.
The shear rate (&quot;spread&quot;) between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds have once again a new record high reached.
In anticipation of the euro-zone growth figures
Statistically, France received a supported by the household consumption growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, ergo a bit better than the expected 0.3%.
The Federal Statistical Office INSEE had, however, the slump of the revised figures for the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In truth there is in the fourth quarter, which worries the most economic experts.
Germany had to register his hand over the same period a growth of 0.5%.
A first estimate of the entire euro zone is expected at 11 clock, with the EU commission warns of the risk of another recession.
Energy Policy:
Facts should prevail over dogma
Is there a topic that is not based on short-term considerations or because of emotions must be dealt with, then this is surely the energy policy.
Availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power Measurments and the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is reasonable to accept an election meeting on the occasion to reflect on this subject and about the role of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if the totality of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options explored.
The French were to substantiate their opinions on objective facts and rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, driving the demographic evolution of a doubling of electricity demand above 2050, should not have to give a huge proportion of people on a vital element.
At the same time you have to alleviate the shortage of fossil resources to produce electricity can remain stable, without forgetting the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a vanished from the environmental debate topic, in order to fight against climate malpractice.
The accident of Fukushima changed any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains sealed for its decision in isolation, to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which submits its decision to the need to find a viable replacement source substitution, even in Switzerland, the mere intention to build nuclear power plants, only the last generation.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few States have, however, continue their projects with determination.
The United States has in turn decided to Fukushima, annexing their park another unit by taking the once abandoned after the nuclear accident at Three Mile Iceland operation.
Even if that is focused on renewable energy sources, German model sometimes portrayed as a model, so, however, contradicts the reality of the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be reflected in the form of a price increase of electricity prices, increased by the use of imported gas increased energy dependence on Russia in particular, caused by an increase in gas-and coal-fired power plants CO2 emissions.
The totality of these effects is unpleasant are already being felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark is a cause for reflection.
Denmark is a part of European leaders concerning wind energy, from which it is 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the largest users of coal and gas, used alternately with wind energy, which links its CO2-emissions and its electricity prices will rise by 65% ​​and 50 % higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy to pay our neighbors in contrast to our French households by 40% higher electricity bill.
As the price of energy is in the globalized economy is a key part of the competitiveness and a stable mortgage industry on national soil, have the French company because of the cheapest electricity in Europe an advantage.
Any significant reduction in respect of nuclear power would, therefore, a significant increase in energy prices lead to what the noble statements would be an illusion on the re-industrialization of our country and to defend the purchasing power.
Surveys show that is a price that relate to large majority of French people is willing to pay as little as they can detect resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let us recall that the energy policy of our country has made it an industry with 125.00 and 410.000 direct jobs induced build.
Because of its strong export character brings a plethora of specialized small and medium enterprises on the international markets and turning them into creators of countless jobs.
France should take the decision to phase out nuclear power, which a Groβteil would fall victim to these SMEs, and the annual 6 billion euros of investment goods and exports of nuclear energy would shrink more and more.
Which one would hire an electrician to function designed EPR at sixty years, if the demise of its producers is inevitable?
To solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no more a work of the devil as a panacea for the generation of electricity.
Developed by the company, Areva, low-CO2 solutions for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy are evidence of the complementarity of energy sources.
The highest level of security must be maintained for the nuclear power is an absolute imperative.
In France we have a security authority, the uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works, such as the construction is carried out in Flamanville.
Their work teams that have made a name for their professionalism are of the idea just too obsessed with security.
Within 50 years the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, in Three Mile Iceland, has occurred under normal operating conditions, it was without consequences for humans and the environment.
In the drama of Chernobyl reactor design and unendschuldbares, human error has been evoked.
In Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters unprecedented magnitude was caused, which caused the deaths of several thousand people.
The nuclear industry will also draw lessons from this accident, as she had done previous to the two.
As a fruit of this approach as well as a cooperation between the security authorities of the French and German designers and operators of nuclear power plants, represents the EPR is a design that makes it resistant to such phenomena.
Since it is considered among electrical engineers as desirable to build a nuclear power plant, would be a freeze in Flamanville a fabulous gift to the competition from Areva and EDF by them could be free rein to seize the leading position in the inevitable nuclear power development in itself.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best Energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber dominate a debate that is determined as economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration burden or opportunity for the economy?
Guided by Nicolas Sarkozy, immigration policy has been criticized from many angles - overloading of police, judicial and administrative organs because of the numbers subject to policy, compatibility of this policy with the status of a &quot;state of human rights&quot;, as had France itself entitled.
Recently, the students directed against foreign harassment by the authorities, the newsreels had coined the Home Secretary had casually (see Libération, 23 May) announced that France &quot;no talent, masons and waiters from abroad was necessary.&quot;
But this policy was rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
On this subject two countries have a broad consensus between right and left.
From the right side of the sound of Jacques Chirac was struck, which had declared in 1976 that &quot;are likely to represent 900 000 unemployed people, including over 2 million immigrant workers, not a problem for a country,&quot; from the left side by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990, France &quot;could not hold the entire world poverty.&quot;
The only difference is the degree of generosity
The fear of invasion by hordes of Polish national soil plumber was divided in 2005, both from right and left.
From both camps, immigrants were perceived as a burden to the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that is to admit the immigrants to willing.
Francois Hollande, is limited in its program to banalities, indicating co-development allow it to solve our &quot;immigration problem&quot;.
This conception of immigration as a burden, a problem may possibly affect the elections, but it is economically costly.
Like us, the economist Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work realize that the latest findings concerning sums of Immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.) among the specialists, a broad consensus exists regarding the positive influence of the immigrant tide of economic growth, wages and employment in host countries.
The limiting immigration would undermine the growth and harm the labor market situation.
The fears over the impact of migrants is based on the idea that this threatens the local workforce, especially the less qualified to substitute, by putting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in fact much better than they did as the native laborers, because they carry schwerpunktmäβig occupations in sectors that are underutilized job technically.
The low-skilled immigrants to work in sectors that local laborers little irritating, the more skilled immigrants to work in the most dynamic sectors in which the training is not the labor supply adjusted.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, this complementarity between natives and immigrants also causes a positive effect of the influx of immigrants on wages and domestic employment situation.
Giovanni Peri is calculated in this way that a 1% increase of the immigrant tide miteinbezogene a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9% is bringing about.
And this without considering the fact that the immigrants brought in by the idea of ​​the diversity of creation and economic growth is conducive (high proportion of naturalized immigrants in American Nobel Prize winners, were Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute to the social systems in net, in the European countries on average at a height of about 1% of the total budget.
The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that at the age of 30 years, immigrating to Germany person in the state budget through its average lifetime net contribution (revenue minus expenses) by introducing some 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to be the start of his mandate, the lack of intersections &quot;with teeth&quot; to bring about.
This said teeth, which should deter the immigrants achieved, however, exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, is now, to think through the European democracy
Democracy is a precious commodity, is also a fragile commodity.
The European continent should be able to even remember who it was invented in Athens for more than two thousand years the whole of the 20th Century about the tragedies of World War II, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also in Franco&#39;s Spain, Salazar in Portugal and Greece had the Supreme can endure.
Some had probably thought it was sufficient to exercise the voting rights, and indeed to see the most direct way possible, a triumph for democracy and for all of their enemies.
It is known since Napoleon &quot;the Little&quot; that acted it is a feature of the mind.
Universal suffrage, the necessary condition of democracy is, is this not a sufficient condition, and can just as easily become &quot;an instrument of repression&quot;, as it was the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot expressed.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, public spirit, values, organization, control and separation of powers, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe, in which we find ourselves, is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and foremost political and democratic crisis.
The change of attitude of the Greek true-false referendum would in this respect, revealing character had twice: once to the need for a powerful return of the policy, on the other side, but also those of the unsettling feeling of the impossibility of its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now shifted, and that target the republican soldiers, or at least most of them, not in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to push for a national success of the referendum, which was organized in response to the needs and in reverse order.
A free ticket for the European autocrat or a jump blindfolded into the emptiness of the Nationalist retreat: A fabulous choice for the citizens!
No, we want to cleaver, but a collective task, from full right to clarify and steadily, a choice and democracy, this time at a European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you know the rest no longer to end where the bullet - there is only one crisis, and it prevails in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, which bows to the dictates of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffers from his swoon, and his lack of solidarity.
It is Europe that is humiliated on an international level.
It is concerned about transfer of sovereignty to Europe - this is Europe, which gradually loses its sovereignty, and thus every one of his affiliated nations.
The urgency is to return the sovereignty of the people, the leadership of the European project to indicate the source.
Because it is situated on the whole, if the Europeans to reduce the burden of their debt, to free himself from the markets and a future through investments can initiate.
The exit from the crisis, decisions at the European level as a condition that can not be made without totally democratic Legality, without us, certainly to lead to disaster.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists fought a long time was urging everyone today to the European economic governance.
I agree.
But this is without political integration and strengthening of democracy - as envisaged by the citizens - imagine would be a folly again and another dead end.
We must take a new step in European integration us.
To create in the Republic of France, it took the fact to &quot;create&quot; Republicans.
The interests of the revolution could not afford enough alone here.
This teaching remains valid.
We need to form a more integrated Europe on an economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically democratic Europe, a truly European popular sovereignty.
We Europeans need to create Europe.
&quot;Contactless&quot; smart cards are becoming common
The World Fair for smart card opens on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude its doors.
The year 2011 was, according to the really smart € with a 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (cash cards, SIM card phone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The tragendste segment here is the contactless technology, the payments on public transport or payment of purchases made possible by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared with a year earlier sold 320 million should this year 460 million contactless smart cards are sold worldwide!
Its market share should increase even further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and over 10% of the global smart card market (6.925 million cards) represent.
Europe wins in terms of contactless payments to the ground, after a long time the Asia-Pacific region has lagged behind.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals to accept this.
In France, the beginnings were modest: only 400 000 contactless Visa cards were distributed.
The supermarkets, however, make steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued this year, 2.5 million passport contactless MasterCards.
In order to move towards higher speed, it is now necessary that the banks provide their customers with these cards.
&quot;Have two big French financial institutions are obliged to hand over their customers systematically in future bank cards, which are equipped with a contactless chip,&quot; announces Nébouy Gérard, CEO of Visa Europe, France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
This is only a first step on the way to the payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A vanishingly small percentage of devices is now equipped with the transactions necessary to implement this technology NFC (Near Field Communication).
&quot;They were in default.&quot;
&quot;But they should at least next year, experienced a real upward trend.&quot;
&quot;We expect in 2012 with worldwide sales of 80 to 120 million units,&quot; said Marc Bertin, Chairman of € smart.
But the banks take the initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had yesterday the launch of a test run in Caen announced, which will run from December until next June.
The iPhone of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE runs a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Societe Generale had testified yesterday to prepare for the launch of an offer that allows customers contactless payment by phone.
Front terrorists understood from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is worried about the relationship between al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb, and the sect Boko Haram.
The already long-standing relationship between the suspected terrorist group al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of Algeria Abdelkader Messahel himself had confirmed that Algiers was now about &quot;gained confidence.&quot;
&quot;The way to proceed with the two organizations and the relationship of intelligence indicate a clear cooperation,&quot; he said without going into further detail.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The investigation into last January which had taken place in Niger kidnapping of two French ports brought to light.
They should have been on the following day at the same time as several of their captors at a getöten by French special forces carried out operations in a restaurant in Niamey Aqmi kidnapped by followers of Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory.
French and Nigerian investigators say they have found in the rubble on site several phone chips, which belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorists axis
The analysis conducted phone calls leads to several parties who are stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are especially interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: A number leads to a Nigerian who had spent a long time period in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, the other leads to a man , regarded as the Aqmi and the sect to be related.
&quot;This is progress, but you have to wait for clearer evidence certainly before one can speak of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem&quot;.
&quot;However, it is conceivable.&quot;
&quot;We know for years that the sect is financial and intellectual support of Auβen and that these shows are increasingly active,&quot; moderating the Nigerian Kunle Amuwo researchers.
In these last few months were the &quot;support services&quot; has become in its course always obvious, wearing just the speeches and the operation modes of Boko Harem, which suggest now the added drag of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives, the same handwriting as those that were used by Aqmi.
The international community, to begin in Washington, has exerted pressure on Abuja since that time, so it helps there for the problems caused by Boko Haram bill.
The Nigerian authorities have considered the grouping, in fact, a long time as a community of Illuminati, which no special attention must be paid.
Quick Success
In 2002 in Maiduguri in surrounding a mosque, a school and fundamentalist Imam Muhammad Yusuf founded Boko Haram - &quot;Western education is a shame,&quot; which means as much as in Haoussa - pursuing the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this impoverished region experiencing rapid success of the merger.
They politicized and stressed strict adherence to the Sharia, while committed to its affiliated activists in the fight against the godless central government.
The first activists have churches, bars and public authorities in their sights.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram were with their increased attacks against police stations particularly active.
The reaction from Abuja is undifferentiated as usual.
The army surrounded the city, it has 800 deaths.
The taken captive Mohammed Yusuf was killed in prison.
As a result, the increasingly radical sect and leave their strongholds to the north.
Last Christmas she was committed to an attack in Jos, which claimed 80 lives then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram assigned the debt of a suicide bombing, which occurred in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind
In August comes the local headquarters of the United Nations for international priority target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which will run from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia to worry since all safety experts.
While Aqmi Mali and Niger has occupied, operated by the Somali al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko harem, a new threat appears in the center of the continent to be.
Last week, hatta Alain Juppe during a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria warned Boko harem and shown its willingness &quot;to communicate any information.&quot;
The world according to Council Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry regarding compete in oversimplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and support for Israel.
Can a crisis weakened America is a complex world with simple, not to say, do silly ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates so voters could almost get that impression.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and her colleagues whose thundering declarations and their statements can be about the Foreign Policy, a traditional Republican emphasis, repeatedly announce.
Fall on China, Iran and the Israel-help - often in no way substantiated - slogans.
The threat regarding the appointment of the &quot;Grand Old Party&quot; highest in class standing Mitt Romney, the Chinese people to quote from the WTO and the &quot;currency manipulation&quot; - a leading topic in an America that is irritated by the migration of entire industrial sectors to Asia again Äuβerste to accuse -.
Bad luck, if this is to imply the introduction of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to be a mature vision of Foreign Policy have to have nearly cut off in terms of his emotions flattering conduct the air.
He had called for a full-blown, but constructive exchange of ideas with Beijing (also the current attitude of Obama).
But Huntsman is not heard, since he stagnated in the depths of public opinion polls.
Reagan&#39;s likeness
Romney had also vowed military strikes against Iran if sanctions should fail to Stoppung the nuclear program.
&quot;If I am elected, I command stop Iran,&quot; he had smoked.
&quot;Will Obama re-elected, they get the bomb.&quot;
In addition, he has promised increased military aid to Israel and Obama accused of being partners with respect to obligations that remained guilty.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain&#39;s second highest, placed candidate, in turn carries a shameful acts of ignorance on display.
Recently he called for giving the Chinese military threat against, since Beijing, &quot;trying to develop a nuclear power&quot; - and seemed to be the fact auβer eight that China is already in possession of military Atomarwaffen since 1964!
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran äuβert, in turn, to be willing to take the American army in Mexico against drug cartels in service.
Obama 2009, said the use of Foltermaβnahmen against terrorists mutmaβlichen was also endorsed by Cain, Perry and Kandidation Michele Bachmann.
It is a far cry from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a auβenpolitischen heavyweight.
The current presidential opponents counter, Reagan had also had a simple idea and won in spite of all the Cold War.
They recall that Obama was selbstein amateur and water had to give in his wine, for that matter about anti-terrorism.
They insist on right to the failure of his naive Zwiegespräches with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his &quot;boys&quot; from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
This hostility is not quite so easy.
The population estimates rather positive assessment of the National Security under Obama, I have turned off the store.
Since Iraq, she is wary of military intervention, leading to paralysis.
And Obama surprised reasonable, arguing that America needed to be rebuilt economically, to bring his leadership to a new life.
Nord Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and western Europe directly with Russia, was put into operation.
It will supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with flying colors.
About 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, last Tuesday on the Baltic coast with orchestral sound and gourmet buffet at the inauguration attended the new gas pipeline Nord Stream will link Russia and Germany under the sea directly with each other.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte of the Netherlands have symbolically turned together the control of the valve, which carries Russian gas to Western European network.
The new gas pipeline will be 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas per year extra provided by a first pipeline of 1,224 kilometers, connecting the St. Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, a total delivery of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - is permitted to be completed by the end 2012.
And it already makes the eventuality of building a third line echoes to track itself.
Gazprom has for the timely and accurate completion of this huge building like a victory.
The project was in Poland and the Baltic states strongly disputed.
The Nord Stream pipeline will provide gas supply that is a direct to Germany, whilst avoiding any pipeline route through third countries (Poland and Ukraine) on the continent.
For this reason, these two countries lose some of their power: for them it is now difficult to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close the entrance to Western European markets.
Warsaw, involved in most of the debate was not shied away compared to the Nord Stream pipeline with a &quot;new German-Soviet Pact,&quot; in connection to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive The curative.
Western Europe has won the endorsement of the Russian project an even higher degree of security.
But at the expense of a weakening of European energy, because the project has made a breach between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has made it ready in less than five years, his vision have a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, the strong gas consumptions and go their gas reserves are running low, to enforce.
&quot;This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us to organic way,&quot; Francois Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, by pointing out to what extent the groβen gas contracts by political and economic side are important.
All this in the broad smile of Lubmin numerous representatives in Gazprom&#39;s managers explained in terms of gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an excellent technique.
The underwater cable is made of steel with concrete coating, they should protect them from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed at 200 m depth.
Had to be avoided when it was built during the Second World War minefields dating.
&quot;Some hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution&quot;, was announced by Jens Mueller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream.
HOT STUFF had strengthened measures designed to protect the fauna and flora to be taken.
The line is a long line of metal, heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, which is cut along the entire length by anything: neither valves nor maintenance stations.
A control was provided platform off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders have refrained, as the Swedes were a little eager, a Russian state company settle on a permanent manner at the level of their coasts to see.
&quot;In the event of an accident, we close the gas passage in less than a minute,&quot; specified Jens Mueller.
In the event of a leak in the escape of gas transmission, gas located so into the air.
This case is considered by the designers but only unlikely, since the Schweiβnähte was estimated to be from a leak resistance per 100,000 years.
The state monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot that is controlled for purposes of external observation from a ship, as well as a device that circulates inside the gas pipeline.
It has the form of a cigar, miβt one meter diameter, is introduced into the interior of the pipeline and propelled by the gas pressure.
After three full days of travel through the pipe at a speed of 3 meters per second, the unit provides accurate information on his arrival on possible deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty long years, without having the slightest repair must be submitted.
The gas circulation is ensured simply by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access control, 100 in cash at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to realize this project.
The wiring remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, here are the German companies E.ON and BASF&#39;s affiliated (according to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (both 9%).
These five companies have formed a grouping calling itself the North Stream and charged with the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is headquartered in train in Switzerland, where the taxation is particularly favorable.
Gazprom has subsequently leased the entire capacity of the society of its gas transport, on Twenty-year renewable contract.
&quot;Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter How much do the real amount of gas transporting fails,&quot; specified Jens Mueller.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction has been secured for 30% of shareholders as well as 70% by bank loans.
The total labor costs should amount to 7.4 billion € for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez was the total investment, for example, 240 million.
The minority shareholders are, however gewiβ to recoup their expenses back, because Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas transmission occurs on a sandy, pine-forested shoreline revealed in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meter high gate valves form the gas outlet.
Sensors to measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of the incoming gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday of the terminal with one million cubic meters of Russian gas supplies will elapsing per hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine is a brand notebook.
By an Italian company about fifteen years ago launched Moleskine would like to give the letter back new style.
It has an air of adventure, with candlelight and spent hours writing delivered.
The Notebook by Moleskine is easily recognizable with his black, rectangular cover, his rubber band, the eggshell-colored pages, such as aging throughout time.
The Moleskine notebook as we know it today, however, emerged in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided its time to bring it a distinguished design notebook on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then technical advisor to the company, is charged with the launch of the new product.
The notebook was called by a traditional production techniques, Mole skin (mole skin) inspired, which means a Baumwollack used for example for covers of upholstered benches.
This type of notebook was asked by writers and travelers very much.
&quot;Moleskine has an old and almost forgotten subject revive, who was until the 20th century avant-garde artist as an icon,&quot; said Maria Sebregondi, now brand managers at Modo Modo.
The success occurs.
Between 2006 and 2010 sales increase by 26% and establish themselves with sales of 12.7 million units.
This is a far cry from the usual production of the first years in which only 3000 notebooks are designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is executed in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to prepare a composite sketch of the buyer, since the notebook business as well as enthusiastic students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of a cosmopolitan, cultured and open to spiritual clients.
The small Italian company, which counted 12 employees in its beginnings, now employs over 100 employees and since 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and one in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet sites like Fnac, in small boutiques in the city center and knows how to assert his identity.
&quot;We are the spirit of the times and followed his new stationery, which consists despite the boom in e-mails,&quot; said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand exposure called &quot;Detour (detour)&quot; was launched, exhibiting the artists and architects in their own notebooks.
In August, the company introduced during the film festival in Locarno also a cover with a leopard pattern on the market.
Moleskine has benefited from its success and this cultural zeitgeist and was able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer cases ... The brand has the full range of products.
A success, the envy brings on the scene: In the fall of 2006, Modo Modo from SG Capital Europe Fund investment, today&#39;s Syntegra Capital was acquired, and struck up a new chapter in the history of the Moleskine company.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers working in such good shape?
About 19% of disabled people are to find a job.
Today begins the &quot;15th week of work for the disabled&quot;.
Despite a purposeful public policy that was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is always twice as high as the average mean value: 19% versus 9% of the total population Arbeitlosigkeit.
Discouraging?
&quot;No, it says Éric Blanchet, general manager of Adapt, the&quot; Week of work for the disabled &quot;align.&quot;
&quot;The results achieved within fifteen years, progress has been substantial.&quot;
&quot;At that time the unemployment rate is not twice but three times as high.&quot;
&quot;Nevertheless, there is still an enormous amount to do.&quot;
It must be said, however, that for the unemployed with disabilities continue to survive numerous obstacles before they get a job.
More often it hits the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low skill level: 80% of them have no school and there are only 10,000 people with disabilities under the 2.3 million students in higher education.
Finally, the long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for people with disabilities compared to 38% in the overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria that are difficult to re-start work, and &quot;form the core of the problem&quot; that the said Christian grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an organization formed in 1992, the company is assisting to recruit disabled workers.
So much material on the brakes.
Remains the unspoken, the attitudes, which, although of course, but nevertheless continued to develop slowly.
One was in April of the association IMS Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité study, which surveyed managers have &quot;a weak level of knowledge about disabilities,&quot; the &quot;over-represented&quot; is &quot;of people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually Mind poor ones.&quot;
Result that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, which was enshrined in an Act of 1987 is to achieve.
The latter, referred from 2008 numbers originating at a ratio of 2.6%.
&quot;We are now at around 3%,&quot; says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization that is mandated to collect contributions from companies who violate this law.
Proof: The number &quot;fees paid&quot; permanent establishment has been reduced as the sum of the amounts paid in 2007-2011, namely zahlenmäβig of 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
&quot;The 2005 law provides that premium increases, creating a strong pressure on the company, said Pierre Blanc.&quot;
&quot;But it also brings a real improvement in knowledge particularly in the groβen business groups expressed.&quot;
According to the Ministry of Labour employ only 59% of premises 20-49 employees, disabled workers, businesses with 100 to 199 employees and 82% contrast.
Hazard: &quot;How lucky&quot;
Even before the &quot;Blue Tuesday nights (20:45 clock) defied, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had their pleasure that they brought the friendly match, not conceal.
It would be too much to claim that there was a secret understanding between them, but the image speaks volumes symbolic.
Side by side on the podium of the spectators were seated George Stade de France and Eden Hazard Leekens well and happy to make peace.
Five months after the spirited gesture of his player&#39;s attack against Turkey, the Belgian national team coach had nothing but praise harvested about his person.
&quot;I am very satisfied with Eden, its progress and the fact that he is Belgian.&quot;
&quot;I want to look forward,&quot; the native of Lille, in turn assured.
As for the contrast between his statement in club and national team, &quot;It is a unity that justifies everything.&quot;
&quot;In Lille I am throughout the year, which is not the case in Belgium.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s time for me to go to the Start.&quot;
Hazard is coming to Saint-Denis, brought about Friday night against Romania in terms of the match against France, at last, &quot;to shine&quot;.
Without fail, however, to the grade of &quot;pleasure&quot;.
The French national team he cheered since the age of 7 years, his victorious campaigns he led between 1998 and 2000.
&quot;I was always supported,&quot; he confirmed.
This inevitably contributes to significant improvements in the &quot;unique&quot; nature of this encounter even more.
So much in advance: &quot;Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) it will be,&quot; he recalls.
&quot;We&#39;re just crossed my path.&quot;
&quot;Playing against them may mean groβes luck!&quot;
Leekens left his hand with kindness &quot;pride&quot; which suggests.
&quot;The pride of being a gala match&quot; unsubscribe.
&quot;Pride&quot; also - in his capacity as a &quot;neighbor&quot; - to confirm that France &quot;has become a team at a very high level,&quot; and little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
&quot;Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job,&quot; he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium is missing in the next European Championships, so the technician does very well with the plane of the Blue (the French national team) share ... namely to Brazil in 2014.
&quot;We come out small Belgian Large Cap,&quot; he said.
&quot;We are going to plan a thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry.&quot;
&quot;You will notice in the upcoming games.&quot; The game against France involved.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with a worldwide optimism the return match against Bosnia (22:00 clock) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first leg of the two teams had missed the sobriety.
&quot;At the end of his 90 minutes we are a happy team and above all a Happy Land.&quot;
Paulo Bento sees already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him it is not the slightest hint of doubt that &quot;La Seleccao,&quot; his national team for which he was responsible for September 2010, qualify for Euro 2012.
For Portugal, this means, in fact, only 90 minutes bliss.
But there is a match to play, and abzuservieren an enemy, namely Bosnia.
In view of the first leg (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated over more than an hour the game, but the team was unable to impose the all-important matter of the stamp that the pressure would have taken away from her.
&quot;This is a good result, but this involves some risk, because we have made no away goals.&quot;
Home, however, in their bright radiant with Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident in front of an audience that would also heiβ be on the game by strike, even if the game was, of course, billed as &quot;very tight,&quot; said the optimistic, however, clear-sighted Bento.
&quot;We expect a very close match, but are entirely convinced that we can gain the upper hand,&quot; said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
&quot;We still have a 50% chance to be part of the 2012 European&quot; relativized, however, the successor to Carlos Queiroz.
The draw on Friday the Portuguese forces in Bosnia to achieve a goal and win.
A draw may be the Bosnians, who also have a goal necessary to meet already.
&quot;This is a good result, but this involves some risk, because we have made no away goal,&quot; Bento regrets.
&quot;We will compete against a team that has the high technical quality and has many players with individual qualities,&quot; he added.
As in Zenica before the Portuguese had to exert maximum pressure on already at the beginning of the Bosnians to &quot;give them no time to think.&quot; &quot;
A good idea, provided that this time they will put into action.
