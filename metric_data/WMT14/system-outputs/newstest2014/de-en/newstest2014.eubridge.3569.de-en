Schools are encouraged to greater focus on math, spelling and grammar
In courses in English literature pupils must at least one piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914.
In the examination "ungesehene texts" entrance to encourage broader reading.
The combined rate of English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015, pupils need a separate GCSE exam for language, and there are strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will tomorrow publish the new curriculum for English and maths - the first subjects that have been radically transformed.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the exams regulator, a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less course work.
In a speech in the summer of Education Minister Michael Gove, that there is a broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence, "he stressed that, would be" more challenging GCSEs, ambitious and more, "said.
Studies show that in English schools spent less time for mathematics - 116 hours per year, or three hours per week per school year - than in most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time in the curriculum for mathematics, but from coalition circles, the comprehensive math exam, combined with a greater weighting of the compartment in rankings - will probably encourage schools to call more hours.
The curriculum will be more emphasis on "real life problems in the," including financial mathematics.

The officials
I was asked to write to you about your investigation to mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and used by contract or a direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these facilities, I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government that led me from a moral duty to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw I was exposed to a serious and persistent campaign that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum, which gives me the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and high officials - including the United States - have the revelations to a system of mass surveillance, which is accountable to nobody, as a service to the public.
The spying revelations attracted many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously concealed abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these findings is becoming clearer; at the same time, the risks visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts demonstrably positive, my government treated dissent as a breach of loyalty and seeks to criminalize political expression and put on trial.
However, the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the government of the United States, with the support of the international community that prejudicial attitudes.
I hope that I, if the problems are resolved this humanitarian situation, will be able to take part of the facts about the statements made in the media, particularly with regard to truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and in accordance with law.
I am looking forward to a conversation with you in your country, once the situation is clarified, and I thank you for your efforts to uphold international law that protects us all.

Traveling through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle free medical care in remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend to treat hundreds of patients
In the West African country, there are not many doctors, only one in 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is among the top 10 "CNN Heroes of 2013."
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 in order to elect him to the "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue its work.
21 years, Georges Bwelle of his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the resources to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
First, he had a broken arm, but it was an inflammation, which to his brain and caused a haematoma that should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There was no neuro-surgeon in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We have released him from Cameroon, if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years to accompany his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment that they had to offer.
"It is not easy," Bwelle said.
You can leave the house at five o "clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first one, and it is not first.
There are very many patients.
Indeed, some people die because they have to wait.
The situation has changed little since Bwelles father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio is in the United States with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, could not afford most Cameroonians the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And the poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father, and so many of his countrymen to see suffer ripened in Bwelle decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers carried out 700 free operations last year.
He was a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a nonprofit organization called ASCOVIME travels on weekends in rural areas and free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday and up to 30 people in minibuses and continue with the helpless medical equipment on the roof of unbefestigtes terrain in the villages, need help.
Not everything runs smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: A feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a cause for celebration and Bwelle - with his broad smile and his boundless energy - the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team begins with the investigation of hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," Bwelle.
You come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offering medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates, a document that is required for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team simple operations with local anaesthetic.
The operations are normally held in a school, the City Hall or an apartment; after the procedure, the patient and go in the recreation area, in order to make room for the next person.
The lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment is powered by a generator of the group and Bwelle and his volunteers until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is an arduous work, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team.
"They drum all night, so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work.
The group - a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - has carried out last year, 700 free operations and know that it makes an enormous difference to the people with their work, which helps them.
A man explained that the free operation of that he had received enabled him to return to work.
"The changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job he finanziere 60% of its charitable activities, Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.
"I really do not know when he is asleep," says Katie O "Malley, who for the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily participates in Bwelles group.
He is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization, so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O "Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience they would never get at home.
"We can be in operations, where we help blood abzutupfen or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O 'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students pay for their trip to Cameroon normally themselves and often donated medical equipment.
But they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle accommodation, transport and guide.
"He is undoubtedly a hero," says O "Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people, knows no boundaries.
For Bwelle the almost constant work is not a burden.
Others to give to a happier life, and thus to fulfill a promise he made to his father, he has a great deal of pleasure.
"I am so happy when I make this work," says Bwelle.
And I am thinking of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to get people to laugh and to alleviate the pain.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be for the first time on 22 February appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the most senior cleric in the Catholic church after the Pope and they are also to elect a pope, Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the choice of his successor.
Currently, there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 years, no longer take part in the papal election - which is a group of 120 "".
In a statement, in which the news was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman said, there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony will be held on the appointment of the new cardinals, which is also known as a consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision on the convening of the in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices, said that the number of voting cardinals will probably be dropped until February.
He explained that a pope usually take so many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of voting cardinals 120, and so many cardinals over 80, as he would like.
The consistory next year is so important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero.
Currently, there is some overhang on the part of Europe, and especially in Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world, in order to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the mandate to find ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Francis has selected eight cardinals who will help him," said Valero.
He explained that it was "quite possible" that the Cardinals Francis ask for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation - that is all very new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from great places to Cardinals, but Francis was "full of surprises, so we do not know whom he appoints."

Europe's elite is ready to do business with the United Kingdom?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and to define what those who care for prosperity and work in Britain, want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have been the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, the British company sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses now exports outside Europe and focuses on countries to modernize and grow, while the states in the EU.
that the government of new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favoured, rather than with the long and arduous process, the obscure to reform EU institutions.
Asked about their views on specific legal issues, from antitrust law to product legislation - the majority of the business leaders of the opinion that control over these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the internal market, since according to the company in the cost of the Brussels rules would outweigh the benefits to be part of Europe's trade zone - even 40 percent of large companies agreed to the, which are traditionally the most Europhile.
Finally, and this is probably the most, our survey of business leaders showed that a clear majority wants a course in the direction of change of the agreement and a relationship with the EU, which is based on trade, not politics.
This realization that is used in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a "meaningful change," which brings the tiller back to Britain.
It is about much - a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain at 16 percent would lead to a change of view in favor of the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: This survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of the UK's conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that the companies expect a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is moving in the direction of a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, as the result of our survey shows, which means for companies with a greater emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.

The Supreme Court confirmed Obama's health law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: The US Supreme Court ruled today that the closely associated with Barack Obama health care law is constitutional.
With five votes to four, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - it forces US citizens to conclude a health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty - within the framework of the tax authority of the state is constitutional.
The chief judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the chamber, while the judges Warren, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 -page law and also took the view that the imposition of the health law, according to federal states either access conditions to expand Medicaid or otherwise all state Medicaid funding would be removed, was not unconstitutional restrictive.
The lawsuit against the law had been brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the eventual challenger Mitt Romney, in the pre-election campaign in 2012.

Gutach: More safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres apart: on Tuesday, the new B 33-pedestrian traffic on the village park in Gutach commissioned - within sight of the old town hall.
Two plants so close together: Intention or folly?
This question is answered Gutachs mayor yesterday.
"The town hall lights have been installed at the time, because the school," said Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser-lights safe both cyclists and and.
The official yesterday officially in operation is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg / Kirch street.
We have the museum, two churches, park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank, and the traffic flow from the residential area.
"The high volume of traffic and pedestrians had another traffic lights to their safety," said Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of Offenburg decisions.
"According to the latest measurements on the B 33 approximately 12000 vehicles a day, the municipality of Gutach, about ten percent are heavy traffic," said Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Security is simple," says Arnold.
A total of four road shows had been carried out, including a roundabout was considered, but discarded because of the narrowness of the Kreuzungs area Sulzbachweg / Kirch street.
It was tested everything according to Arnold in the choice of the traffic light poles, "an extra for us with extra-long trunks loaded trucks, we have ausgestestet whether these vehicles from the Sulzbachweg onto B 33, without the traffic light poles umzuknicken."
The traffic light system itself is the most modern, which is currently on the market, "explained Arnold.
The plant is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights of drivers, for example, are in the sun.
And it is economical: The older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
In each direction, there are three light installations.
Arnold said the technique of the new plant: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
The pedestrian is the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
The road is free, comes directly green for pedestrians, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be stopped for pedestrians.
"If a group or disabled people on the street, the green phase, everyone has a safe on the road," said Arnold.
Of course, the driver must think here as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: Hardly showed the green light for pedestrians, a luxury car - in bright red.

Drug tunnels discovered with its own railway between the US and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnel for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, which was equipped with lighting, ventilation and electrical railway operations, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimetres TPM tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages that they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs zigzag pattern over a length of six football fields, linking warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless inconspicuous warehouses, which makes it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel has been closed before drugs could be transported undetected, the authorities said.
The discovery of the tunnel had been safeguarded eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine, according to the records of the court.
Three men who worked as a driver, according to the authorities, were charged with possession and the intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
You threaten prison sentences of between 10 years and life.

Foreign workers on 457 visas could be subjected to "authenticity test"
The government is considering additional measures in the framework of a "test" for foreign workers on 457 visa.
The test should be introduced, he came across a criterion that is designed to prevent the 457 occupation by unskilled jobs or used as a back door for the migration of family and friends to Australia.
Today, the government published a proposal after the former members of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the comments of the government in terms of foreign workers, because that could be viewed by the neighbours of Australia as an insult.
"Vocal statements such as foreigners should stand, and that Australians" are a very unpleasant throwback at a time when unions demanded a protected labor market, "she said of the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, it was meant that white workers should be protected, and if some people in the region vernaehmen an echo of this historical artifact, it would not surprise me.
The debate proposal outlines 12 measures that were once considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O "Connor, who was yesterday to talk about human trafficking in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the "authenticity" criterion is accepted, it could be checked to see whether someone who applied for a visa, "the is in the cases where the applicant is to be the owner or a relevant person of the sponsoring company or personally connected."
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders, as in the past, companies who wanted to support only a small number of workers, and hundreds have stopped.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died of a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on Christmas Island.

It threatened alternative traffic on country roads, which are already black spots.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would be from the point of view Pronolds also only a first step.

With every movement of handling equipment sounds a shrill warning noise over the terrain.
"The signals are security and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, managing director of handling in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, that is widely seen as unfavourable to the wind, and there were already some complaints from people from the north of the city.

Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was a child, Halloween was something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, late and dress for the neighborhood.
Today, I am more the Halloween muffle.
In the last two years, I have not declared ready to distribute sweets from my apartment, and it will probably not do this year.
But, according to the statistics, I am a black sheep on Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million, to be precise - celebrate Halloween this year, a total of $6.9 billion for candy, costumes and decorations, according to the American Association of retailers ().
One thing that I am pleased every Halloween then again, the trend values.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, provocative inanimate objects are the rage.
Women must no longer remain in sexy clothes, they can now also tempting food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet that Daft Punk space men will succeed this year in the Instagram feeds.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year we have our dogs and were not alone, to my surprise.
Indeed, Americans spend $330 million this year for costumes of their pets, according to the.
There are a lot of "hot dogs."
As for sweets, we are not squeamish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, as The Nielsen Company.
That is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, Lutschern, candies and gum.
That is good news for the US Department of Commerce 41 million people, with the slogan "trick or Treat" through the.
Indeed, we are more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - let us not deceive ourselves - eat.
The only thing that we do not want to consume, the sugar sweet Candy Corn; nevertheless sold 15 million kilograms of Halloween, the National Association of confectionery manufacturer.
That is about nine billion corn grains.
It is a mystery that I could not solve.
Nothing is more on Halloween than houses where it haunts.
You have great names like "terror Behind the Walls" (which, incidentally, is in a real prison), "" and "the House of Shock."
In fact, there are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which is $500 million in revenue, America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photographs of the trousers and friends on Facebook, where you do not get rid of them, and then the guy that leave a comment like "nice facial expression."
But we are on the.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great pumpkin, when we were children, and the carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree - something that we have made from a.
Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend began only last year thanks to Villepinte rest, so most of us have grown up with it, as the pumpkin zurechtzuschnitzen and not to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million for pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, slowly rotting in the front yard, probably comes from Illinois, where this year were harvested 245 million kilograms of pumpkins.
If you want to score correctly, please call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve their 921-pound pumpkin.
Pimps will go to prison
Because of exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threats and insults and dangerous bodily harm, the District Court of Konstanz, a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen sentenced to three and a half years in prison.
Former German army soldier, who worked as a bouncer after two missions in Afghanistan, as part of a consultation process, a confession.
He has learned in five cases, women over the Internet or telephone contacts that he sent against their will on the line after a few weeks.
He used to break with violence and threats.
The revenue of the women who for him for years, he kept.
Through confiscation of mobile phones and SIM cards he discounted women's contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who gave the women, he brought them to different brothels in the southwest.
There, he had them partly in order to control their revenues.
In court, the defendants initially claimed that he is suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert serious doubts about the mental restriction and a limited debt capacity indicated, the 33-year-old a full confession.
The court had to hear none of the injured women.
As a Criminal Investigation Division-official reported, after a first display by telephone surveillance measures at least four more cases of ausbeuterischem human trafficking.
The intercepted conversations were marked by high levels of aggression.
In later questioning the victim had confirmed their ordeal.
Another witness, one of the women had discovered bruises all over the body, have so far made no statement.
It was "a completely broken personality," look at the violence and exploitation in this profession as normal.
The defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday.
"He has been solved these circles and wanted to lead a normal life," he said.
Tripodi denies to have been influenced by Obeid
Against the former Minister of Labor Party, Joe Tripodi from New South Wales launched an investigation by the state corruption supervision.
The former NSW Minister denies to have changed the rules on at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, the hidden stakes in three properties on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC ­ Independent Commission against Corruption) has extended its investigations on Friday on the question of whether Obeid influenced several government ministers to leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a cafe, without tender after their expiration in August 2005.
Now is the accusation, Tripodi knew from Obeids concealed interest in the land after the Tripodis former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole on Thursday.
In years of talks, which began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it, and also wanted longer maturities.
In 2009, the leases for the company at the Circular Quay, which provided the Obeids $2.5 million a year, without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was from February 2006 to November 2009 port minister, had previously argued for public tenders.
But he denied that the changes made at the request of Obeid, who had been as Tripodi confirmed on a review of the lease arrangements of the government.
One of the ICAC's telephone transcript showed talks from the August and September 2007 between Obeid and Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved into the port ministry, after he had worked under Obeid in the fisheries authority.
"The discussion in these telephone conversations, the development of the commercial leasing arrangements?" Asked the deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi said.
I do not remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
NSA revelations reinforce corporate paranoia about government surveillance
On a balmy day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew low over the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for constitutional protection and the fight against terrorism (BAT), the German domestic intelligence service, he shoot the roof of the U.S. outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media wanted the BAT antennas to prove the existence of surveillance and the action led to an exchange of words between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, was again in September that the U.S. no possibilities of foreign espionage, "in order to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies, so that they could strengthen their international competitiveness or their profits."
But since Edward Snowden, the whistleblower's former employees, began with the publication of his US surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate executives no longer sure whether they can take the director at his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and data acquired American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company's paranoia about government surveillance to a new peak.
The last straw was the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone verwanzt, possibly for the last 10 years.
If the most powerful person in Europe, then certainly potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence agencies and companies.
I think that it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," says Oliver Green, president of the BITMi, small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the United States now almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consultancy firm EY.
In the documents leaked by Snowden, however, there has been no evidence so far that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities, and they should reduce their dependence on the United States.
The companies are sceptical.
The Bundestag has been suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can close my eyes and open them slowly...
"It does not work," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software maker SAP.
If you had a strong European IT industry, then they should not have been 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized by the coal on cars to agriculture.
Everything, except for the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the reach and technical sophistication of U.S. spy agencies revealed by the Snowden revelations shocked companies, which had previously seen the greatest risk of espionage in China.
The cloud computing is a big change, because European business leaders are now aware that data stored in the United States are subject to the jurisdiction and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, the revelations about the US data mining activities with Prism about ten percent of the members of the United States plans to use an American supplier.
Jim Snabe, deputy CEO of SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers who did not exist a year ago, it is: Where my data will be stored and you can guarantee that they remain physically in this area?"
Many German business leaders believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their valuable secrets and therefore they must be guarded at all costs.
That economic espionage is taking place is not a surprise.
This has always been the case.
"It was an issue for many years and has not fundamentally changed by the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on commercial and industrial level, as we do that, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
The company does not normally on the, which affords attackers benefits.
In large companies, employees have long eingebläut that take away a free USB sticks at a trade fair or the unguarded behind a laptop in a hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, board member at automaker Audi, says that it was standard practice for years, before a board meeting to collect the phones, so that they can be used as a.
The German BAT advises managers to use simple prepaid cell phones when they go on foreign trips, because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away.
However, there is the concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global leaders in their respective niche.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, the staff and financial resources to protect trade secrets effectively against unauthorized access," warns the BAT in a report.
The US company warn against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate in February, France, Russia and Israel behind China in two of the countries that used for the procurement of economic data from the Hackings.
A member of a German blue-chip company agreed to when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French domestic intelligence DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month with the following words: "The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terrorism, spying on its allies."
When the horse experts in droves in Cardiff met to select the horse of the year, they knew that a rat race.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The kid, who is not even in kindergarten, and only a few months ago, made his first steps, and his Shetland pony toffee trotted only loosely through three rounds and got the first prize - 30 adult opponents.
The inseparable pair, both of the same size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition, which is organized by the Sunny Bank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he appeared in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had his plate cap in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which would be far beyond his age.
And toffee received top marks for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and practiced every day with the Shetland pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the entire field of competitors and went with gold trophy and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had taken part in a competition with toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who for more than ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was hooked and all have cheered and applauded him."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he has done a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens that he cares.
As it is launched, it will not be long until he is on the "horse of the Year" - and I am sure he will do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."

Rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for Tasman organic health
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions that are linked to the rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health care to ensure that the government can not waste the money of the state.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis that has been caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic disease and system constraints.
The funding for a period of four years, it was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe that the unique challenges faced by the federal government," Plibersek said today.
The 325-million-dollar package includes $31 million in emergency aid for election.
Further 2600 operations, including orthopedic surgery and treatments for grey Star, residues are to be eliminated.
In addition, there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare for inpatient stays, the specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system of electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinic staff told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth, and monthly report on where the extra money has been spent.
A three-member commission will be set up and is designed to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million dollars of little use if "they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the Tasmanian public health system on a more sustainable course."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for the fact that they have responded to his request for urgent aid, which he first expressed to the prime minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to the public health system in the state of the list of concerns," said Wilkie.
According to the federal government, the state electoral services are largely offset the recent cuts.
But the health spokesman for the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is only a "Band-Aid solution."
"We are in today's situation, because the Labor state government $430 million from the health system," he said on ABC TV.
It is not that a state government almost half a billion dollars from the system and the Commonwealth 300 million and then pretend that the good news.
Dutton called Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.

Proverbs come from the Bible
About 40 women attended the last women's breakfast this year in the protestant parish Bisingen.
Theme of the day in the town hall "proverbs from the Bible" and "phrases from the Middle Ages."
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the parish shall extend, after breakfast in a lecture to the biblical proverbs.
"Proverbs life skills, rules or warnings," she said.
They compared several proverbs with the relevant Bible and explained the importance.
She called proverbs such as: Wood eye is vigilant, as scales fall from their eyes, to keep an eye on someone is the Lord during sleep, wash his hands.
Several times, the speaker will advise their listeners, saying it was.
The phrases from the Middle Ages, the churches councillor Christel stretcher: All good things come in threes, blue, something.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases, which she called "bridges to the past."
Finally, a raffle was raffled off.
The prices were covered on a table and delineated humorous, before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round interfered mayoral candidate novel Waizenegger.
You could call him the Dostoyevsky in the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a god viewfinder, a meta-physicist, his novels and stories have something serial.
Amazingly the kinship abroad: The sharp eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And so, as M. Fyodor Dostoevsky, with its massive oeuvre as Ergründer and apologist for the Russian soul, read Philip K. Dick as American Prophet, which is something in their own country.
Some titles are published in the world, the Lagoon Mans-cassette with 118 stories sells two thousand one.
Dick explains America - the realm of the breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security and the belief, to be chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Perhaps he was crazy, drugs had added to his brain.
He figured early on that the computer Divinitäten.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine, the creator of his creation.
This is the "Blade Runner 'problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
Now this story is particularly significant.
The "Minority Report" dates back to 1956, he exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunals.
It is the principle of "pre-crime" developed, "", which is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dicks world that resembles our own terrifying mutants look to the future - and the police.
"We collect individuals who have violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We catch them before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "In our society, there is no serious criminals, we have a penal camp full of Pesudoverbrecher." You read time flows.
They assume that bad things happen, and that the criminal idea into practice.
Dicks narrative acts as the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the NSA eavesdropping.
Anticipation of the attack: So does Obama's drone philosophy and practice.
But Dicks story is not yet over.
The police chief complained that there is no separation of powers, the military controls the everyday life - and what is left by the state.
The will be monitored and a future crime.
The system is.
It is perfect, but it is lying.
It invents its own conditions.
Errors and victims, not only but builds itself.
The system creates the danger that it.
Philip K. Dick read, again and again to come closer to the truth.
Blocked court decision to stop-and-Frisk directive of the NYPD
A federal appeals court in the United States on Thursday blocked the formation of a judge, the changes to the stop-and-Frisk Program ("stop and search") of the New York Police Department, and the judge absolving them from the case.
The stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until an appeal of the city.
The judge had ruled in August, the city was in the Constitution with the way the programme will be implemented for stopping and questioning of people.
The city appealed against their assessment and ordered remedial measures, including the decision to set up a monitoring body, which should support the police in changing its directive and the corresponding training programme.
The appeal court heard the arguments on Tuesday the suspension.
The report said that the judge had to be released from the case because they have violated the code of conduct for American judge, is determined that a judge is to avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements, in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the BMW Demotika program.
It has appointed an outside agency to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms in directives, training and supervision, and ordered a pilot program with the body cameras in areas where most of the checks were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were sacked after an inspection by the police.
One of the appeal of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-Frisk-tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Such controls are there for decades in various forms, but the number of recorded controls during the term of the partyless Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, was submitted by four men, all minorities,, which developed into a class action.
Advocates of changes to the stop-and-Frisk Program of the NYPD say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police and influence the way, like other police chiefs use the scheme.
Opponents argue that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; wasted money and would not solve the broader problem of a police force that is after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that they do not finish the stop-and-Frisk practice was constitutional, but only the kind of the implementation of controls by the NYPD reformiere.
Anger over sentence for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 at the bombing in Bali, reacted angrily at the verdict for the last of the instigators, who was brought to, as Umar Patek should be shot in their opinion.
Patek, who was nearly ten years as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia on the run, was sentenced yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing to a sentence of 20 years.
With punitive suspension, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A guilty verdict in a series of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even if they can apply for the man who, because of its reputation as a wordless bomb maker known as "Demolition Man," could have requested the death penalty.
The decision has aroused painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, the 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his Mitverschwörern almost ten years ago.
Fighting back tears, she said, Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"We should put him in front of a firing squad," said Corteen to AAP.
I have to live with every day that I will get no further grandchildren and I will never see my daughters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground, on 12 October 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., a powerful bomb exploded in a small truck that was parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bombers explode a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma after the attack for a month and "died" three times while he was on a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserves the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
To keep him alive - no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured hundreds, is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers, who was in court.
He cheated nearly a decade of arrest, but was finally picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces less than four months later, the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden killed.
During the trial, with an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided the reference that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and to rebuild.
"He has not arisen," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much pain he has caused to other people.
The verdict came before the tenth anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"This year, there will be many tears," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his sentence.

Profits at Bombardier to decline in supply figures and contracts
The Canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc on Thursday reported a 15% drop in net profit, after he was caught by declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail sector under pressure.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, a flight test data for his brand-new CSeries aircraft and gave no new information on whether the plane could go under the ambitious timetable next September in commercial use.
On the maiden flight test aircraft followed one and a half months, so far, only three more starts, which the question of whether the testing phase is proceeding as planned.
The results were back behind the forecasts and led to a drop of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating of "outperform" from "sector perform" in view of the fact that the stock in the next one to two quarters of a limited course potential.
"Although weaker delivery figures were expected to aircraft, but the margins of development in the transport sector, we are clearly disappointed," Doerksen said in a client.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries, if the test program is progressing on the plane.
If, however, no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we expect that the market is more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the aircraft series of CSeries can catapult the company into the market segment that is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was presented to the public in March, after months of delays and flew for the first time in September.
But so far are binding orders for the CSeries with 177 moderate, as potential buyers want to wait and see the results of the flight tests whether the claims of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new commercial jet aircraft.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jets.
The company said on Thursday with analysts and media in addition, the program is in the schedule.
"The test aircraft is no longer than expected, on the ground," said Beaudoin during a telephone conference and added that during the lifetime of the aircraft were ground tests and software updates.
Each manufacturer is planning.
We have decided to take a first flight and then add a review period, what we have done.
This is happening throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test planes will probably start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, it said.
However, analysts remain sceptical as to whether 12 months after the maiden flight of the first customer can take a CSeries aircraft in operation.
Bombardier said it checked the planning for the commissioning (EIS) and will update this in the next few months.
"The slow progress of the flight test - even if they are obviously Bombardiers internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
In the third quarter with the end on 30 September Bombardiers net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share of $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share is unchanged 9 cents.
Sales slipped slightly, and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he had delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 to 26.
The order book in the aerospace division amounted to 32.9 billion dollars on 30 September, and was unchanged compared with December 31.
"In the field of aerospace, the results were in the framework of our targets, but the low order intake and the overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this area has increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order book in the transport sector, on September 30, $32.6 billion dollars and was slightly increased to 31 December.
The profit margin in the field of transport has been hampered by handling problems in some big contracts.
According to corporate governance, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In afternoon trading on Thursday, the Bombardier shares by 8.5 percent and stood at 4,83 Canadian dollars, after it was announced that the Google CFO Patrick Pichette will switch to the board.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardiers closest rival, reported a 10% drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Rules on electronic devices on planes in Australia remain in force for now
Australian airline passengers must continue to tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite efforts in the US to relax the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their rules so that passengers can read on their devices during critical phases of flight e-books, can see or play videos, they are in the "flight mode."
While the bulk of the flight's passengers already allowed, but there are many people find it annoying that they can't read at the launch and landing their e-books.
Australian companies are watching the decision to implement the US airlines have to do a lot of work, but have no immediate plans to change its rules.
The air traffic control authority CASA also declared that they will look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight in Australia still apply.
"The CASA currently has no specific rules on use of electronic devices on the plane," was announced.
The issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain security at any time and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by the crew.
Virgin has already led to the CASA talks on an extension of its use of Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and said that it is open to changes, but these should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience, having (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said a spokesman.
Qantas said that it will remain until further notice in the current rules.
"Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices during takeoff and landing, should not be used, and we currently have no plans to change that," said the company.
The FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and will look at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision on US companies vary depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, and manuals, training materials, hand luggage-change programs and customer training.
"After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers using portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smart phones at every level," the FAA announced.
In rare cases where visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers, the landing gear.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment at takeoff and landing safely under the seat or in the lockers.

Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "In humans is well known that the left and right brain hemisphere react differently to stimuli, positive or negative emotions."
Here, we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs as in humans, the right brain hemisphere for the movement of the left side is responsible and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs on the side of their, the researchers monitored the animals, while saw these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of four-legged and analyzed the behavior.
We will soon understand why the tail in the first, in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the dogs films with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate ablenkende other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
If the animals looked like an otherwise ausdrucksloser dog has moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wedelnden dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But it was the tail to the left (again from the perspective of the dog wag), their increased heart rate and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara the dogs do not communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience that movements they should worry or not.
He said: "If you have several encounters with other dogs and a swish with the tail in one direction is associated with friendly behavior and the right side, a less friendly behavior, then you respond on the basis of this experience."
The researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could lead to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and Visiting Fellow at the Faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, this was not the first study to examine whether left and right is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn your head to the left, if they see an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it is a happy dog.
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada: "Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog, if his tail wag on the left and the right not to be restless, rather than the other way around, as in the Italian study."
According to his testimony, the differences could stir, therefore, that the dogs in the various studies the animals in the movies or the robot dogs not interpreted as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs, could help, he said.
"Although there is considerable evidence of many different mammals that both halves of the brain are used for different purposes, but many of the details still need to be determined, and dogs are no exception," said Bradshaw.
Since their behavior record, but simply put, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one, sometimes in the opposite direction.
Tony Blair said that he would use the opportunity to return as a British prime minister, but acknowledges that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his leaving office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.

On the question of whether he would like to return to the post of prime minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard in London with the words: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this happens, so..."

In fact, the demand in parts of South Asia, where the debt of households is so large that ValueMax, where they made their exchange, this week became the third pawn shop, which is listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
The Verpfaenden of jewelry is not just a quick way to get money - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga, but also almost as cheaply as an unsecured bank loans.

Historic highs in gold prices in the past two years have reinforced the trend for pledging personal items, as the people use the opportunity to turn the jewelry of the family in cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the 200 pawn shops in the city-state.
People say: "The price of gold looks good, let us pledge Grandmother's gold chain and bring back next month."
The largest Thai pawn shop operator, Easy Money, has seen a 20% increase in customers in its stores in recent months.
The growth in the mortgage business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 other would like to expand in Singapore, not only in the neighboring Malaysia, where the company operates four houses, but also outside Asia, Yeah Lee Ching, managing director of Value Max.
The company financed with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars, which this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders are due to high interest rates in the crossfire, yeah, that does not only lower interest rates than other lenders, but not directly increased the debt.
"Customers finance items that they already have, and the film personal valuables does not increase the Haushaltsverschulung," she explained.
The mortgage lending business is increasingly socially accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use pawn shop in financial difficulties.

With future prospects
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives.
Their house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with greenery, an old trees, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city, there are only a few minutes by public transport.
"I hope that you have no fear of spiders?" Asks Waltraud Ries, and shows a big spider on the door frame.
I am looking for a new home for my husband and me for some time now,.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spider phobia, but the concern, at the age of the many steps to the house and no longer in the apartment, she says.
Moreover, since a meniscus tears operation, the Mittfünfzigerin experienced what it means to move with a handicap from floor to floor.
Recently published a book of her on 'living in old age - What home form is the best for me?'. "
"Our apartment is the best example of what is not in old age," she begins to tell.
When they moved more than 20 years ago with her husband in the duplex apartment, it was just a beautiful apartment.
in his mid-fifties Waltraud Ries.
They also know that it is one of the few people who actually deal with the issue of 'living in old age.
Most of it, as long as possible.
They are, 'she says humorous.
Only when the suffering is really great, you think.
Then it may be too late, "said Ries.
In her book, the interior designer 17 residential models for a self-determined living in old age.
"What chooses living form, however, is always an individual decision," she explained.
D i e solution, it is not for the ages.
Even those who can afford the residency in Tuscany or Brittany, should always consider that he could also be ill.
And: "Without a good knowledge of the language vereinsame in Dolce Vita," the book author Aussiedlungs willing to consider.
Among their models are classic models of care, alternative forms of housing, or the oft-quoted pensioners - WG.
At the age, everyone has his tics and quirks
"For me it would be a residential community, but nothing," she says with a wink.
Certainly not as a student house with a shared bathroom and kitchen.
"In the age you need his retreat," Ries.
A senior living community can still work, the author does not want to.
It must then differently than in the classic students WG.
And sometimes you just want to his rest, "she believes.
With this view, at least, it is not alone in the capital.
"The majority of old people in Stuttgart want to stay as long as it is in their own home, is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the country's capital.
The department advises people around the theme 'ageing'.
That is why older people would often just inconvenience and restrictions, only to be able to remain in that environment, it is the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends all dealing with the age of their house or apartment to check, and not just the best craftsmen.
Today, there is also the age just reconstruction specialists.
Even in the apartment for one or the other, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, clarifies the interior designer.
But it is not always the existing apartment age and thus accessible, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience has had to make Waltraud Ries.
While you could install a stair lift inside the apartment, but the road paved with stairs to the, would be a far greater obstacle.
It will continue to search until it has found the ideal property for herself and her husband.
Before the move dread it more than before the spider on their front door.

Cocaine addict lawyer, warned the drug boss before police investigation, will go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information on underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defense lawyers, warned of a drug baron in front of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into its activities in the drug trade, after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The Kriminalisten as a "first-class" vaunted lawyer nicknamed "Bash" was arrested at his home in 2011, after the police had monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched as Scarborough (32) three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire,, while it was the with colleagues during a meal.
The investigations have revealed that regularly consumed class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were monitored by the police as part of a major investigation procedure for heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They, along with 32 other people were arrested after the police in a series of raids heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds in cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals, because he feared that his drug addiction can be publicised.
Today,, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, at Liverpool Crown Court after weeks of two counts of obstruction of justice, found guilty and sentenced.
He admitted the cocaine possession in a previous survey.
The lawyer was convicted after the police found in their investigations of Scarborough, that he had been in February 2011 in regular telephone contact with disappointment.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Dittas house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the dustbin of the lawyer.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, called Scarborough regularly with preferring, who was at the dinner in the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it became known that was a "regular consumer" of cocaine, after tests of class A drugs were discovered in his hair, his wallet and credit cards.
He was later arrested, but denied to take cocaine and said that he had spoken with the alleged dealer, because this was his client, and claimed that their discussion, "lawyer secret."
During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and he was taken from a hair sample.
The police interrogation, he admitted, he both under his home address and an office in the workplace and clients would call him at home because of legal issues.
In court, it became known that he is in the drug trade, some of which he had previously called for significant arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about it.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else, does not break the law."
He is accused of abusing his position as a lawyer, because he has too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplied his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his messages was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer for these people.
But that went far beyond the borders of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He was the police investigation as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr preferring brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed that his independence was compromised.
Ditta dismissed any wrongdoing and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait for 15 hours, but do it immediately."
But after the hearing, said Lee Halstead, superintendent of police in Lancashire: "Mr preferring has taken the step of a criminal defender to a criminal when he began to buy drugs from organised criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime, which commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and trust and confidence in the public.
He has betrayed that trust and trying to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire headed the investigation against, which led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough itself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared the conspiracy to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Thirty-five people were sentenced to total fines of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website published disappointment over a range of questions and answers about where he, his dream job, as a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America, his ultimate guest at the dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality is the motivation for his work.
Until now, the police inspectorate Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only twice to egg-throwing children who threw them against building facades.
Because the homeowners realized it in time and removed the egg remains, will be no material damage.
Furthermore, were some Sylvester Böller detonated in the city, but there is no material damage.
A bishop-Freundorfer-way reported that his car wrapped with toilet paper and his Radzierblenden were stolen.
Until the arrival of the police, the man has his Radzierblenden, however, to the immediate vicinity all recovered, and the police.

Council takes tracks targeted
The railway crossing "Hirschen" to improve road safety?
Yes, the local councils have decided.
Schiltach must take for 220 000 euros.
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve in the coming year, the Kinzigtal-rail route.
In particular, to increase the safety at railway crossings - it is regularly nationwide to collisions of trains with other vehicles.
The communities, they need to be involved with one third of the cost, the rest divided and.
Schiltachs city architect Roland Grießhaber explained to the specifics of the council Bahübergangs "."
There, the city plans to build the tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks a bulge.
There could also carry bigger cars, for example, those carrying logs, oncoming traffic, without blocking the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall so that the city could widen the subsequent street at the time, in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This has been controversial in the municipal council, as some councils, the need for road expansion in doubt: Thomas Kipp, saying the mood of the critics: "We have to because so few vehicles so much money?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway crossing "Hirschen will regularly used for.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" will be transported via this route, because up to 20 metres long vehicles could not use the route to the Häberlesbrücke there, because they could not turn on the main street.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.
It is that they would have to be rebuilt and renovated mountain and Schlossberg tunnel, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "On" deer "for a longer period of time an important traffic.
The council agreed to investigate what would cause the expansion of the street.
Regardless of the was approved by a majority of the railway crossing, with the proviso that the necessary supporting wall will be built so that the city of the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstrasse" if necessary, for meeting traffic increase to around 5.5 meters.
The reconstruction of the railway crossing in the tanning Trautwein could lead to a different problem, which access to the "Geroltzhäuser way."
The administration had Breinlinger examine the restructuring plans of the railway from the engineering firm, because they had doubts as to whether the planned end of the Geroltzhäuser route is still possible.
The investigation concluded that it is that the tendency of the road conditions could lead to longer vehicles.
Responsibility for this, in turn, the city as a.
The reconstruction could take liability disputes.
Since both the wood collection and turning in the current state of development, we should not support the reconstruction of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
It is also the risk of a collision of with a vehicle on the transition of significantly lower than the other railroad crossings, because the in the middle, which is a good view.
Even trains from the main railway station should be slowed down at this point as far as that no collision.
The approval was the reconstruction of the railway crossing refused because the city Schiltach "the problem with aufsitzenden vehicles" would have to pay, the councils, as, as the train after the construction of the responsibility.
As the panel considers the conversions at railway crossings "Heubach" and "Kuhbach," have already been made for the arrangements with the.

Over the years, the Fays innovation, as most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.

"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me that if he is here, he sometimes through the alley between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I live here.

Australierin sets appeal against a prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket, because she had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, has appealed against the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15, was found guilty of having made a false statement, after she had indicated to the Thai police, she was raped in the early hours on Sunday, 10 June, a local taxi driver, while two other men, she said.
Later, however, the photographs showed a video camera that they had arrived safely in their hotel after they had been separated from her Australian boyfriend.
The police in Phuket Bamford interrogated for two days until they confessed to have invented the story.
Until the trial is on the ground in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day sentence in a prison with a low security level on the edge of Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, which has appealed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with a request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney, the whole family was "extremely concerned" about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to have back in Australia.
"We are very concerned, of course, but we hope that it is as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the ruling and is against a deposit of 50,000 baht at large.
In Australian reports that it makes in the meantime, in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court was to hear Bamford will be represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appointment could also lead to the imposition of a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that Thailand could be made after the recent assassination of travel clerk Michelle Smith in Phuket, to improve its tarnished image, and it is therefore an acquittal.
The painted fence on the Bechtle-plot

They also looted and broadened the footpath, it says in a press release.
The planned covering the decaying house at the rear of the property was not allowed for security reasons, because the terrain.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had denied the window-dressing with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI.
Before the action of the BI was a banner with the message "we are in favour of it."
The administrator's approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative, however, little in their action.
Their motto was on the big poster "we are against Bauruinen."
They wanted to draw attention to the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should fail one day.
In conversation with many passers-by before the "construction site," it was clear that some people believe that it will go with the completion of the project in the city of many better, although a few have the same questions to the dimension of the project was presented as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign, because the city is delaying these answers, the BI.
As we heard, the public statements made by the mayor.
In May, said the City Council meeting that he feared the end for the thermal baths, the population should vote in the citizens against the plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some appear so downright scared, others see it as a "crude blackmail attempt" to the population, according to the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all volunteers.
Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, a monitoring group
Syria had destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and Gitftgasmunition, said the global monitoring group for chemical weapons on Thursday, while in the north of the country clashed near one of the sites, which allegedly toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war almost three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the deadline on
November 1, the organization based in The Hague, Damascus, to destroy all facilities for the production of chemical weapons "or", including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling of ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which is basically the first stage of the destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable, which is aimed at the destruction of all Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can produce no new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
According to estimates, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin gas.
The announcement came at a time when fighting on Thursday in the town of Safira, the experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage sites, such as the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The activist group, which has a network of activists in Syria, the number of deaths, said on Thursday, 120.296 people have died.
This 61067 civilians, including 6.365 children.
On the government side were 29.954 by the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters of the, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of people killed in the conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This figure has not been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels, many of whom have ties to al-Qaeda groups.
The observatory, said that there was on Thursday losses on both sides, but gave no details.
The fighting underscores the danger of the chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a brutal civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is now convinced that all of Syria important production and mixing / supply facilities and has seen its destruction. "
That is why "are currently planned no further inspection activities."
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of inspections and 21 of 23 of the sites visited by Damascus.
Because of security concerns had not been possible to the visit of two facilities, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC, the two sites have been abandoned, "according to the Syrian statement... and the existing objects of the chemical weapons programme have been relocated to other facilities have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two institutions that have not been able to visit the OPCW inspectors.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, the must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPWC next month.
"I salute the bravery and the courage that you all have shown while fulfilling the most challenging mission, which has been carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the monitoring organization in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in the civil war against Assad's government and its security forces, which includes many members of the Alawites, a secession of Shiite Islam.
In other developments, the head of the monitoring group, Rami Abdurrahman said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he said.
RBS suspended two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from their foreign exchange department, two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global regulatory investigation into the alleged manipulation in the currency market sharply.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in the investigation into the world's largest financial market, the $5.3 trillion to the owner.
The two dealers would be the first RBS staff who have been suspended in the widening investigation of the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business.
The bank made no comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
"Our investigations are continuing on this issue and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation said that the RBS the records of e-mails and instant messages, and were sent to a former trader at the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, have passed.
The trader, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is now leave from his current position as a European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European spot trading at Citi, was this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly a senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders has been accused of any wrongdoing.
The instant message group of Usher were bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, said people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of their employees, after the Swiss regulator Finma had declared that they will examine the alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - currently dealing with allegations that bankers should have denied transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or receive information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks comb instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations, the dealers in a field, which is one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because of low volatility in currencies restricts the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it was almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trading the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the growing use of internal platforms by banks that "one with very low ticket prices can affect the market."
The news came on the same day, when Credit Suisse announced this week that it had terminated a distributor of London Exchange Traded Funds offices, after he had caused a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and is cooperating with them.
"We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is under control," said Credit Suisse.
Coulson, phone-hacking for checking a tips
The former News of the Word-editor Andy Coulson was supposedly "phone-hacking, monitoring and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court at the Old Bailey, the News of the World heard in May 2005 a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlbys voice mails, and pursued them, but Coulson called and left messages, such as the court was told.
"According to the public prosecutor's office is Coulson, who is now editor of the NotW, no one who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to catch them red-handed, but one that people are faced with a history to see their reaction," said Edis.
He said that NotW use three methods to investigate stories citizen investigators: Phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows of the second, the, it cannot be.
What about the first?
He knows about the phone-hacking?
He denies that, but we say: "And whether he knew about it."
Rumors of an affair Clarke's first feature of the editors of NotW, as a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby, said: "Do not waste your time, it is with Charles."
A band with voice mail from their phone at least three occasions in Mulcaires apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective on the Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
At the time the searches were the grandparents of Pawlby anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, said Edis.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup monitoring the movements of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, I would like to talk with Charles."
Edis said Coulsons activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, the former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett was due to an affair with a married woman, when he was with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue to have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone-hacking.
Early puberty: Grow up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white age, as studies show.
Physical changes mean not directly puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity is a trigger early puberty
The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
A mother should be worried if her daughter grow at the age of seven or eight years of breasts and pubic hair?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics paediatricians Association this week in Orlando, Florida, said the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time to reassure parents - normally, this is not a sign that is now fast puberty," explained Kaplowitz.
Obvious indicators of development, such as growing breasts, Scham- and Achselhaare and body odor, with girls.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the Menarche (first menstruation) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age at 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"If the development of breasts, it takes at least two to three years to the," said Kaplowitz, author of the book "early puberty in girls: The essential guide to deal with this problem frequently occurring."
Time is the most accurate test, which is progressing puberty.
It is controversial, which is actually the onset of puberty, but it is "precocious," if the breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight years.
In most cases, the process slowed down or stalled – something that can monitor a pediatrician.
For faster progress could be by a Endikronologen so serious problems such as tumors and cysts.
There are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: The premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and small stature in adults.
The recommendations for a medical or hormonal therapy based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.
Psycho-social aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he admits: "The suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their age."
The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters have the period.
"They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter has received with ten days.
Even if there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, they were not prepared emotionally.
She was scared and excited by the school home because it was the first in her group of friends.
There are many fully published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Young are similar girls before puberty.
Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported girls on the implementation of a study in 2001 at the age of six to nine years, which establishes a connection between body fat and entering puberty.
Other studies support that conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty tend to be rather than their white age.
There are different reasons for this.
Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, economic conditions on the climate to the genes.
Another mystery: Although boys grow facial and pubic hairs earlier, the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors on the AAP conference underscored the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is widespread even babies and young children.
"We have to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to take advice from their doctor, how they should talk to their child.
"This may mean that you have a conversation earlier than expected," advised Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child is usually good.
Girls who early bloom, need the insurance, the process is a normal part of life, even if it happens sooner than expected.

It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustics, which offered the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga game between the German champions Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
To hear the guests fans with their voices.
The South stand, where the most loyal of loyal - and loudest - BVB fans, first of all, exceptionally quiet: No chants, no battle cries.
The podium of the Capo, which coordinates the common spirit, remained unfilled.
And on the front of the gallery lonely blew a large flag with the inscription "section stadium ban."
Just as goalkeeper Roman willow Feller, as always, as the first BVB players entered the square, brandete short-lived jubilation.
When his team mates followed, there were loud singing and floating scarves - but not everywhere.
The South stand in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south grandstand nothing stirred.
Also that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - for.
Only five minutes before the start of the Capo climbed his podium - and the almost tangible tension overflowed into a loud cry when II restaurant had, as usual, the mood in the at the stadium.
Finally, as always, was the - and finally again as usual here at last was the loudest place in the stadium.
And when the southern grandstand vocal call "Derby winner is" came, everything was, as always.
The silence before was probably a response to the events of the last few days.
Just before spot Derby at the FC Schalke 04 had some of the mitgereisten BVB-Leuchtraketen supporters fired into the grandstand and the place - and almost goalkeeper Roman willow Feller.

What happens on the road with my e-mail?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
The draft Internet service, e-mail, similar to the traditional post-engineered the letter secret?
In the design of the early Internet services was at the forefront of communication.
We did not pay attention to the basic technical protocols to create a solid foundation for a anhörsicheren correspondence.
Therefore, a more traditional e-mail open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna," "Benni" sends a message to the computer of the two are directly connected?
The e-mail program or the browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of their service provider in the first step.
If, for example, has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content of the provider, uses the Benn.
On the route the mail can run on a number of other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can call the content of his provider.
Are traditional e-mails on their way through the network mitgelesen?
Most of the messages will be read on several times by software robots.
The provider of the sender is usually checked whether the mail a malicious program attached.
The receiver systems will also be a virus-check.
Also, check the provider, whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail, wegsortiert is deleted, or at least in a spam folder.
The robots have yet another task?
When the robot systems such as GMail determined the information that Google for placing of context-advertising.
If Anna and Benn communicate via GMail about their next holiday travel, Google can display links to holiday purchases.
Also unknown people read the e-mails?
The likelihood that unauthorized people hear a mail is extremely low.
In theory, but it is possible.
In companies often administrators have the ability to mitzulesen electronic mail.
The law enforcement and intelligence agencies have the legal avenues to intercept e-mails or to take note.
To possible illegal Ausspäh actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails against in reading?
With an encryption after the OpenPGP standard can be effective against Mitlesen encrypted e-mail address in reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to conceal the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that not even easily can be detected immediately, who communicates with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the e-mail market in Germany?
In the play mainly private mailboxes used Yahoo and Google, according to a study of Convios Consulting from August 2013 only a minor role.
While the shares of Yahoo Mail had fallen, GMail was Google.
Germany's biggest country church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of the pastor.
Background is a possible priest shortage of priests, the Evangelical-Lutheran country church Hanover expects that will halve the number of currently around 1,800 pastor and pastors to present situation until 2030.
The profession is very attractive to young people of today, the and offer good prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Protestant press service.
It is attractive to determine the work and daily.
With Burfien instructed the country's church for the first time, a pastor at a place to inspire young people to study theology.
Currently, fewer and fewer young people choose after graduating from high school to study theology.
Burfien leads back to the process of secularisation: "God's voice is quiet, the world."
It is the profession of great freedom and diversity.
I am Mr my calendar and my priorities, where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to the people.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well.
Certainly will pay more in the free economy, but theologians would have a secure employer.
This brings the young people of today, it is not just a career, but a meaningful work.
According to the church, which includes three-quarters of Lower Saxony, currently around 60 pastors per year in retirement.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology student start their Vikariat.
In sparsely populated peripheral regions such as the resin, Emsland or Wendland could in the future it will be difficult to fill posts.
Burfien wants to hold study days for young people, among other things, and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The studies offer a broad education.
You can even be Federal President.

Managing director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee for offences had been charged with child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 because of the abuse of children entrusted to him had been convicted.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission assistierenden lawyer that he had known of the first case, but the second was not known.
He acknowledged that the YMCA opening statement to the Commission was also vague on the assertion that "there was external reviews of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety."
Evidence before the Commission show that the YMCA was informed that he is the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Department of Education) has received in August of this year.
Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management "from me downwards" in the recruitment of Lord and to ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the directives on child safety.
Lord was sentenced earlier this year for sexual offences in twelve boys during his two years of work for the YMCA at the beginning of the.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that employees have to report violations in relation to the Lords regarding the safety of children.
The employees said that they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, she worked as a babysitter, they sit on his lap, said that he had loved it, and children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose leader was Lord, who had asked for a training course on child protection, because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the Kinderdienstleiterin Jacqui Barnat, who was at the YMCA Caringbah the supervisors Lords daunting, "and most of the time was very remote."
The CEO said that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, have affected their friendship with Lord their judgment, which is why they had not reported it.
Hare said that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW his view that the lesson that the organisation from the Jonathan Lord incident ", not" affects reporting "by staff, and the board voted to approve him.
Hare said that the decision to push the employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations, the managing director of children's services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that the contamination of the evidence should be prevented, but it was "overzealous" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was at a time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, no safe for children, said Professor Stephen Small Bone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, of the Commission.
He explained that it had been "serious problems" in the recruitment, screening, training, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
At around 120 metres below a sewage channel from the Roman era of Cologne.
Visiting Cologne, is not in the cathedral.
Some 157 meters of the two towers in the sky and make him the second highest church building of Europe.
But few visitors who visit the two ornate spires, knowing that there are also under the cathedral to discover a lot.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne underworld.
Meeting point for the service center of Cologne tourism directly at the cathedral.
The tour begins very unspectacular: "We start in the garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-oriented city, and that is why there was only from the remnants of the old city wall, which was not too big.
Most users of the park today therefore rush past the Roman ruins and put their car.
But if you look closely, discovered in a parking deck D2 separated by metal mesh rods.
To see about five meters high ruins of handtellergroßen stones.
"There are remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century A.D.," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to the surface, Schulze participants on the upper level, a look into a dark, 15 meters deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which, unfortunately, is hardly noticed.
Next stop of the tour is the Pretorian, and here the participants climb back down into the depths.
We are seeing here is the office of the once powerful man north of the Alps, the of the CCAA.
What does CCAA, asks a visitor.
"The acronym stands for" Colonia Claudia Ara Aggripinensium, "which in English as much as" city of Roman law and the Agrippinenser, founded by Emperor Claudius in the place of of the altar for the imperial cult "means."
And the Pretorian is the former governor's palace, the power center of the Roman empire on the Rhine.
From the hall of the exhibition, a tunnel access to the Roman sewer, which is here at around 120 metres.
"You can go quietly along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want," Schulze encouraging guests.
A surprise Schulze has.
After he took the key at the box office, he leads the group with a 16 meters deep shaft.
"We are now in the mikvah, a Jewish ritual bath," he says.
The Jewish community built their bathroom deep into the ground, in order to get to the groundwater, which was essential for the ritual washing.
To date, at the lower end of the mikvah, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels by changing levels of the Rhine.
The mikvah is part of an archaeological area in the Town Hall Square, for the construction work will begin shortly.
to take a few years.
Land Rover announced Rally Series
The interior are racing seats and six-point belts and a.
The options range from enhanced brakes, a service package with care for Bowler Works-mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler, have changed."
They are not all experienced cyclists, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure, as well as a way to world-class events.
We are pleased to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various disciplines in Britain and abroad, and newcomers to the rigours and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really had fun to develop the Defender Challenge Cars - this is an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is the Defender Challenge, a training and test in February, as well as the option to participate in desert race in North Africa and the Middle East.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story to independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland is necessary to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the cue for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a secure border with barbed wire along the.
In fact, it was in the Strathclyde template pointed to the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom to travel in the rest of Europe, but this was - as expected - played no role in the headlines.
No one has also mentioned that the EU member states often bent their strict rules, if it is convenient for them.
As Scotland currently does not belong to the Schengen area, would be the continued disregard for Brussels, only a small concession in exchange for what it really wants from the Scots.
That is not really a story.
And one that is already happened in the years that it already looks like a fossil: The, the first time I have heard the "independence means passport controls" duck at least 40 years.
This is an interesting point in the constant refrain of this ancient history.
Why should we expect from an independent Scotland that dances to the tune of Europe?
Why the London yoke against the trade from Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: The large, taken after the war plan to the unification of Europe is stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead.
Throughout the EU parties are gaining ground, the EU or the euro as a common currency to throw overboard.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party founded Alternative for Germany - until this year - nearly five million votes in the federal election in September, and distribute effectively, the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There have always been local opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
The current economic crisis, it is a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, in connection with the straitjacket, forced into the national economy by adhering to the common currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments create excessive budget deficits - that was the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has pinned down its members on exchange rates, which are beneficial for German exporters - and the German politicians would like to.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency will take place in southern Europe with a built-in productivity disadvantage against Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the imposed by Brussels "green" energy policy - a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer pays the European industry compared with the United States twice for electricity and four times for gas.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner of cheap American shale gas.
As a result of a revolt, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
However, Berlin, Paris does not need more than a gateway to the political legitimacy and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, which the ailing French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU anti-National Front has just won a key by-election and the ruling Socialists in three.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What makes Le Pen, with their newly gained popularity among the white working-class French?
She would like to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-EU currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and it is very possible for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: In the not too distant future, the growing resentment of the EU and the single currency will come to the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it is something like the "Europe" (sovereign) nations favored General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Great Britain distanced itself from the project, hoping to curry favour with the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of (ultimately).
Or we can defend our own economic interests - including Berlin and Brussels to say what they are where hinstecken.
I suspect that Scotland could go in a looser European Grouping quite well, as long as we keep our own currency.
The cooperation with other like-minded countries, is not in a federal Europe of the Nations easier.
Otherwise, we should consider it emulate Norway and keep our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has 2011 spectacular majority due to the rejection of the proposed (and) cuts made by the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence, only to be imposed by Berlin and Brussels austerity.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but no phone calls)
Passengers can now hear from departure to landing their electronic devices for reading, activities, games, music and use the prestige of films, but not with the mobile phone, according to the new guidelines, which were issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
But passengers should not expect that these changes will be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented, would depend on the respective airline, said FAA employee Michael Huerta at a press conference.
The airlines need to prove that the FAA aircraft to meet the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight crew and the arrangements for the storage of the devices, according to the new rules.
The FAA said that she had already received by some airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.
Under these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, passengers must switch smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
You may not start again when the plane reached an altitude of three kilometers, and the captain gives the green light.
At the entrance to the, the passengers must switch them back and they must not start again, before the plane landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are secured against electronic malfunctions could allow its passengers to use the devices, landing on the tarmac, the FAA said.
Most of the new commercial aircraft and other planes for the use of Wi-Fi in, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented, and we are working closely with the airline, both sides will benefit from it," said Glading.
We are to be honest, we feel like watchdogs on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or downloading data at three kilometers, the agency explained.
Passengers are urged to smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So there is still no "words With Friends," the scrabble classified online game that the actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines, because he refused to shut down the device, while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored, because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain banned.
The regulatory authority for telephone conversations at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA lifts may ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing on
Last month, said Mark Rosenker of the Transportation Security Administration National Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national transport issues at CBS News, mobile phones are still seen as a risk.
"Mobile is really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause problems in navigation equipment, but because we know from the FCC that can disrupt the transfer from the air," said Rosenker.
An advisory committee of the industry, which was created by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years has increased the pressure on the FAA to loosen restrictions on its use.
Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCas kill from Missouri are of the opinion that there is no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, up to one-third of the passengers, the closure of the device or ignored.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers, after reports of disturbances of navigation and communications equipment of passengers bears FM radios were, the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that electronic interference.
Airlines offer passengers for several years, Wi-Fi, if the altitude is reached.
The Wi-Fi systems adapted planes are also less susceptible to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices, according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices are generally much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-mail reader, for example, give only minimal radiation, if you umblättert.
But when downloading or sending data transmission values are stronger.
Among the supporters of an easing of restrictions on the devices use by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, invited an airliner full of Kindle e-reader and made a test flight in order to identify problems, but could not.
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk in the use of devices.
Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Airline Passengers Association passenger said he was of the opinion that the disruption of the device is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only scattered reports of pilots who did speak for a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.
The committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots to mandate in instrument landing under poor visibility conditions of the closure of the devices by the passengers.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, describing it as a sensible adjustment for travelers who today would be equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that it is not a pleasant passenger experience is to safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo looking for the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" visited the Pro7 Star Bonn village.
The spokesman is clear from the outset: the most important thing for the ham pig culling, turbo mast is not a good condition.

"Here I am amazed rießigen quantities," the, Black Forest ham as a mass product.
Culling 16,000 clubs per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what matters in terms of quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television with level?
Also details such as the pH value of the meat play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH value.
"I am curious to see if their Roberto Blanco, what happens then," says Jumbo cynical.
Here is the level of private television in its purest form.
But it is worth looking anyway.
The viewer sees that the demolition of the culling is still handwork.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally without bones on the shelf.
The mystery of the ham is the spice mix with the salt.

Freudenstadt: Quick action twist hosts
With a narrow cadres were the gentlemen I TSV Freudenstadt in Schiller-school gym in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb.
The Älbler stood with an experienced team on the other side of the net.
Soon, however, showed that they, too, due to old age, could not compete with the quick actions of delights urbanites.
With the harsh and placed surcharges the Gönninger extremely difficult.
They repeatedly missed by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly through the network in the middle of second-hand passports and attacks and were not on the block.
Two high first sentence profits clearly pushed the superiority of the delights urbanites in all aspects.
In the face of this overwhelming and spielbestimmenden performance was the third set a little slack and sluggish to a 3-0 final score (25: 13, 25: 14, 25: 22).
This will be on November 2, with the TV Baiersbronn, who was clearly prevailed in Nagold, are a much more powerful opponents on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the in the Murgtal hall in Baiersbronn the second teams from Baiersbronn and.
They provided a competitive two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides, especially the ball adoption of mistakes and points of gifts; passports, in the precision was sometimes scarce and in some critical game scenes prevented the look for possible point gains.
In this performance was very balanced encounter in the TSV team by Marcus Blasutto but all the great physical effort and a high level of commitment from both teams.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the people at an early stage in the planning," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the public information event for flood protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants had come into the town hall to explain the measures planned to ask questions to express concerns and ideas.
Häußler was clear: "The ultimate decisions, the members of the municipal council."
The flooding that Gechingen on May 15, 2009, unprepared, was a crucial event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, Häußler.
A river basin investigation had been given with the neighbouring village of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of cultivated land is the goal," says Häußler.
The planning the protection against a of, according to the German weather service statistically every 100 years expected flooding.
Climate change is a 15-percent surcharge.
In expert circles, this is "HQ 100a climate."
The floods had considerable damage in 2009 Gechingen corresponded to a 1000 -year flood.
"There is not an absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häußler.
In order to achieve the protection HQ 100a climate, must be invested in Gechingen around four million euros, with the municipality can land grants amounting to around 70 percent.
But Häußler pointed out that there is the promotion only if an overall concept.
The community is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval procedures should be completed.
In the best case, could be started in 2016 with the implementation.
Among other things, for the protection of concept, which was already presented last week in the municipal council) local measures in the flow of the river Irm from the Stammheimer valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to bring their concerns.
Among other things, has been called into question, why not more dams and reservoirs are planned for the protection of the site.
Gregor Kuehn, designer of the contracted engineering firms forest and Corbe from hill, who presented the concept, stressed that it needs all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal.
Moreover, it is to find the most economical solution, Joachim forest of forest and Corbe.
There was anger in countries bordering the Altorts who suffer even in normal thunderstorm rain storm again under an overload of the canal network.
The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, Häußler pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems other than for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The community is obliged to interpret the canal network so that could be two to three-year rain events.
The sewers larger dimensions would waste millions.
The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One thing that invites you to and again.
One thing that would make the name of the program.
As Déjà Vu is according to a psychological phenomenon, which is to have the feeling of having already experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of the visit of the cafes in the town of Opschlag Kleve in sight Rhine-Waal must not remain in the pure sense of déjà vu.
After all, the cafe with the beautiful name exactly the: A real stay not only intellectually, but hand repeatedly.
Because it's fun and is simply beautiful.
A look into the inner workings of Opschlag 8 gives the viewer to feel good.
The ultra-modern, but not cool cafe atmosphere looks like a place to relax.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top of the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
There's delicious cakes or individually fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have begun before the opening of the charming cafés in Opschlag as restaurateurs a name: In Kranenburg, the "Art Lounge."
The move to Kleve in Opschlag expect the cafe-lovers more audience.
Last but not least, by the university.
"We do not have a specific target group," said Daniel Buettner.
Instead, the two young students would like to raise as much as seniors and all ages in between.
Speaking of coffee lovers.

Daniel Buettner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt cappuccino-drinking.
"A baguette - that is my thing," she tells the NRZ.
Two events were also in the bright cafe.
Rather one.
Because the port was more out there - the Café Déjà Vu benefited from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatzabend.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," found the two 33-year-olds.
But not everyone's thing.
Daniel Buettner is also not a great fan of event evenings: "it is not all right."
And with an event, I always speak only those who are interested in the special event.
That is why events will be the exception rather than the.
"We want to disrupt the normal operation of as little as possible."
Should read: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products, as well as on the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve.
The road, which is increasingly becoming a mile gastronomy.
To the delight of many Klever, guests from near and far, and the students who discover the gastro-mile and the Café Déjà Vu.

Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders on seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, it is a debate about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which set the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width, passengers on long flights in economy class - not always the most airlines, but the designated area is the key to the effectiveness of claims in the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard, which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, but the US Erzrivale Boeing says that the airlines should be decided by.
The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of its twin-engine long-haul planes, and at the event from 17 to 21 November expect record orders.
As the rear part of the aircraft, in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats - is crucial to the economic results indicated that, which is to deliver the new "mini-jumbo" design.
Boeing claims its modernized "777X" take 406 people in seats in economy class, which are about 17 inches wide and ten per line.
Airbus said that the competing version of the A350 befördere 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in economy class, there are nine per series.
Aircraft giants often share blows over technical details through advertisements in the press.
Airbus now calls before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race, directly to the public.
Recently, the company has an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war and donors showed a picture, in which three people are squeezed in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are more than regional turbo-prop aircraft," says Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
In the light of changed eating habits are thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance travel, and the end of the century, has the weight of the average American male between 40 and 49 years increased by 10 percent, the data from the US Health Ministry.
The Taillenumfang male average American is in the 21st century, according to US health statistics 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that his rival is a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly baptized "jet Set" was narrow.
It was, as Airbus, that showed that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat, the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes the figures Airbus to the seat and says it is not to decide at the discretion of the manufacturer, as airlines make the balance between air fares and furnishings.
The company also explains, according to the experience in the aircraft of more than the seat width.
"It is really boils down to give airlines flexibility, so that they can do what they think they need to be successful," explains the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
You do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, there is more elbow, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a major impact on the export performance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters reported in July for the first time, the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing say 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on the the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing therefore squeezes more seats on his plane to make it more competitive for our products," says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort in the European Airbus.
On the other hand, say analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row with existing feature indicated that many passengers opted for closer alignment, which could go hand in hand with cheaper air fares.
"Eighteen inches of legroom would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of view from the Airbus is controlled by the threat of the 777," said Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin no direction, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers, from which the airlines can choose.
The world-travelling jet sellers even tape measure, the establishment of the competition.
Even if they extol the convenience, but all manufacturers also offer jets with hochverdichteter design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with zehnsitzigen ranks, but has not yet been sold, according to its own account.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of greater adaptability of the cabin and offered for some jets wide seats in the corridors.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably fizzle, but it could distract from the wave of 777X-sales.
Veganism is the vegetarianism, differs from this, but in a very significant way.
While vegetarians allow the consumption of cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edam, these feasts are not on the menu of a Veganers.
Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan from all consumption of animal products, including honey is denied.
What remains, one might wonder, but on closer inspection, the vegan food world through a considerable ingenuity.
"Sandwich spreads are very popular," said Ute Henkel Mann, the owner of the local reform House, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also visited the store in the Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealanders vegan, he finds in (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997, I asked my diet and became a vegetarian."
At the turn of the century, then the next step and I was vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather.
He acknowledged that there is no animal products in other everyday concerns.
First and foremost is his vegan ethics.
"I do not want to see animals must die for me," says Proctor, the maxim of vegans, which covers the entire consumer behaviour.
Instead of burgers, hinterherzutrauern scrambled eggs or rubber bears, I have discovered a new products, the enthusiasm.
"It is a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, vegan no surrender, no asceticism, but it is an asset." The assumption that the man with the selection of dining options, Proctor leads on the power of habit.
And it is precisely these conditions could also fail some well-intentioned attempt.
"The addiction is a crucial factor, which leaves many give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor is a comparison.
And: "Certain tastes are not on the animal."
It is often the spices or the type of preparation, which make up the taste.
"But you can also produce the same effect in other ways," the vegan.
At a barbecue Proctor, for example, eggplant, mushrooms and a few Vegan sausages.
He is supposed to a balanced and varied diet, the taste.
Of course, you want to have something between the teeth, which is legitimate.
"It should taste, but it is not only to reduce animal food," says Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption that, he had not suffered.
For me, the change has had a positive aspect.
I am no stranger to cholesterol and have a higher vitamin.
There are high-performance athletes who eat vegan exclusively.
"My blood values are well, I am often check," says Proctor.
In particular, the lack of vitamin B12 warn many Vegansimus critics.
"Because animals are fed with feed, rather than graze on pasture, it is questionable whether the meat you buy in the freezer, the vitamin B12 share is high," Proctor.
For vegans, there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are in order," he says.
Proctor must not go for food procurement.
Finally, there are basic foodstuffs everywhere and every supermarket has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need, I find on the ground.
And I buy something special.
"Many people overlook the fact that it is only the finished products are expensive, but that is the" ordinary "finished products."
In any case, the preparation of our dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly believed.
"In the home kitchen, there is a lot to discover, with a few small tips can be good, if not better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake Proctor could also bring his in-laws.
Family firm of the vegan gives a new condiment.
This dynamic, when you cook together, has a new significance.
"The situations that can arise are as diverse as the people themselves," says Proctor.
He was, of course, but also scepticism.
You enjoy my food?
"I feel bad because I drank milk?" - of this kind must be as vegans with tact.
"I do not reject people, yes, I am part of this society," Proctor would not enclaves.
And the everyday world seems to be not so vegan as - and not the in everyday life, as is commonly believed.
Even fast food is allowed.
There are everywhere!
"Many Döner offer falafel, or a vegetarian Yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he differs on pasta dishes, or a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slow.
"When I started 13 years ago, vegan to feed me, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealanders can find a development: "You must talk to the people, they."
"If enough, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the galley in Mannheim or café bird free.
Proctor has the desire that other restaurants have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of.
"Meat dishes are exclusive, and in the truest sense of the word, because they are different from," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way, from the outset," says Proctor.
But the shopping veganer products can be a little difficult at the beginning.
Especially when you learn to understand that the additives in animal peanuts as color donors can leave seems to comply with the ethics with so many hurdles and traps quickly.
Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives," explains the many ingredients, but the food is also.
"Gradually developed a scanner and knows the signs and logos," it is sometimes better to do than small steps to stop or to stumble, "says Proctor.
The vegan, he is an important moral signal, to raise awareness.
Perhaps he can't quite that playing his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits.
Bavaria's Basketballer optimistic despite the first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euro League could not detract from the FC Bayern Munich, the huge optimism.
"No one can forbid us to believe to win against the best team in Europe over the last two years," said Bayern coach Sveti Lav Pesic after the unfortunate 83: 88 (39: 47) on Thursday evening at the Defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We have sent the message: Even in Munich basketball!
In her first third appearance in Europe's premier class, the Munich sold very well for a long time, but in the were simply not enough.
The guests was the first to turn a 15-point gap 13 minutes before the a leadership change before Piraeus gave the game a turning point.
"We have an incredible fight back against the Euro League champion, but then again careless mistakes," said Bayern professional Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful launchers of Munich in the first two games against the Italian masters series Monte Paschi Siena and the Polish titles Zielona Góra significant victories.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking warfare
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice a lifetime of nicotine addiction.
Before tests on humans will be needed before tests, which can take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said the first results are good.
"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried and tried to stop all methods available on the market, but saw that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus infected selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies to the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which is a smoker no nicotine.
In experiments vaccinated mice that nicotine was administered retained their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination against a "break" would have taken, the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine have achieved their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science in translational medicine.
Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given to maintain the Antikörperpegels so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine are likely to be significantly lower, because it transforms liver cells in antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, could be a future vaccine for people, if he is sure to be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that smokers would use him to stop.
"They know that if they begin to smoke, they feel because of the nicotine vaccine is no more, and that helps them to give up the habit," he explained.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that it is still a need for further research.

Egypt's first freely elected president sworn in
Mohammed Morsi, the presidential oath, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt," as he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president of the and thus the succession of Hosni Mubarak, who had been driven from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He put the oath in front of the 18 judges dressed in black robes of the court, which has its headquarters on the Nile and is modeled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Morsi, an engineer trained in the, and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that since its founding in 84 years ago, mostly as a banned organisation, the government.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived shortly after 11 p.m. local time in a small car convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president, and unlike the presidential pomp Mubarak-era was only briefly stopped traffic, so that the car convoy was able to cross the usually bustling street, the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As uncharismatisches "spare tire" the Brotherhood has mocked his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted the aspirations of the uprising in 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak to your destination.
"Egypt is now a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state," said in a blue suit with a red tie Morsi judges in the wood-panelled chamber, in which he took the oath of office.
Morsi later went to the University of Cairo, where he should keep his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military band played the national anthem, which he listened to in Habachtstellung.
The military leader, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of people in the largest university classroom with chants of "the army and the people are one hand.
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University has developed in the 1970s to a stronghold of Islamist groups of students.
Morsi, on Friday a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the uprising last year at the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he has vowed to reclaim presidential powers that, the by the turn of the head of state.
But, with the departure of the official oath before the court and not as usual in front of the, he is to the will of the military, which shows that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech at the Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter for 60 years in the choir
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermters history when the Männergesangverein Cäcilia almost twice as long as the, in which he was formally honored.
Hubert Wermter was as usual in the colors of his Maennergesangvereines on stage.
Even after 60 years makes him singing with the now more than cherished choir still great fun.
The association was also active Wermter, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and his club loyalty: Jörg Kohr, pastoral speaker on behalf of the Cäcilienverbandes Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented to him - as the choir is also a church choir, a certificate of the association and a letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Prince.
His fellow singers gave him the document of the German Choral Association and an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the ceremony was the 31 autumn festival in familiar tracks: MGV Betra, the songs wreath Stetten salt, the singer Baisingen department and the local music club, the had a colorful mixture of different choirs and singing styles, which had about 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "wine paradise" and "funny, their brothers."
Her honor singer Hubert Wermter they prepared to a small serenade - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "federal song."
The men singing club Betra classical choir sang songs such as "hunter" by Julius Wengert, "far, far away" by Hubert Goisern, as well as the folk song "when you go through the valley."
The songs wreath Stetten provided with his mixed choir and his group of women - the "impulse choir" - for the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir kidnapped with the Neapolitan folk way "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "stimulus" choir also to foreign languages: "Libera Tio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to their program.
The singer department of Baisinger sports club came with "what the Gregorian Schwob?" By Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts "beer song" back in domestic affairs, where the full Mar Musikverein offered the musical conclusion.
For children, there was a small side programme - "grandma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer led a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children of the well.
Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to 100 U.S. dollars to demand from passengers on their flight hand luggage.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, even though, in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers are likely to keep the whole box.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the overhead baggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat remain free of charge.
Frontier said it charged 25 if the fee will be paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who paid only at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O 'Malley said, the fee of $100 is introducing travelers to move in the payment.
"We do not want to charge this amount," she said.
Airlines began in 2008, for the first and second checked baggage fees.
Passengers who tried to circumvent this, therefore, plugged into the cabin baggage as much as possible, with the result that the baggage compartments are often overcrowded on the seat.
Fees are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board.
O 'Malley said, the new fee, it is not really trying to make money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, which would have clearly expressed that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the website of the airline, do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at the gate of Frontier, a bag for free, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O 'Malley said, the website of Frontier and check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed about the fee before they come to the gate.
The new hand baggage fee of Frontier will only come into force in the summer, an exact date is not yet.
Passengers often grumbled about baggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines are happy to fall back on.
They argue that the transportation of the baggage cost money and passengers should pay for this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines have enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
But so far, however, the fingers of charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago, the first charges for hand luggage and later, Allegiant Air, a low-cost carriers.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely followed the additional charges.
He estimated in a report in December 2011 that bring the hand baggage fee Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position in Midwest Airlines, recently flown with spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate, when passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage fee of the company.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothly I have seen in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and physical discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding as lubricated."
Frontier spirit is also the $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
The company said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice, would keep the whole box and will be free coffee.
Water is still free of charge.
In 2008, U.S. Airways had tried to demand for soft drinks, but seven months later, after passengers complained and was opposed to any other big company.
Frontiers step to charge for hand luggage, passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative to customers on its own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to 25 U.S. dollars per ticket sold.
It provides all companies an incentive to get passengers to the direct purchase with them on an online travel agency.
Frontier has gone, however, is the most in this area.
In September, the company began, when booking through an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles.
On Wednesday the miles have been cut to 25 percent of the flight.
A third-party booked a flight with Frontier over 1000 miles brings customers therefore only 250 miles.
Passengers can also book exclusively to the direct purchase on the website of Frontier.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
The revenue fell by 9 percent and the flight capacity fell almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report, which was released on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.,.
Republic has tried to get under the sale of the company's finances of Frontier.

Parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died in a tragic accident, believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a zusammengerollten Ringer mat in the gym of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US state of Georgia was found on 11 January in a mat set upright behind the gallery in the school gym.
The investigation of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which contests the family of the 17-year-olds, however.
"They are convinced that her son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacque Lyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
You would never have believed that he had died, as it had concluded the sheriff.
"They are of the opinion that it has no logic, against the laws of physics, as well as the common sense," said Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be covered up in order to protect the person or persons who are responsible for the death of her son.
"Her son went to school and came back in the bag," he commented.
U.S. prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of Johnson's, since a number of important issues are still unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
His death is due to a crime?
The Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts where they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicates that Johnson was "died from the effects of a" positionsbedingten asphyxiation.
A second autopsy, however, have a different cause of death, Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would instruct the FBI with the conduct of the investigation.

John Kerry declared in an unprecedented admission that the US spying was "inappropriate gone too far."
John Kerry indicated with an unexpected admission softening the defensive attitude of the United States in terms of their surveillance programs, saying that the espionage is inappropriate in certain cases, "gone too far."
The foreign minister also admitted that he bore responsibility for the fact that we have switched on "autopilot" with Barack Obama, when the explosive revelations of the whistleblower, Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities.
The leaked information is the U.S. government in a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
In a speech transmitted by video link on the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: "there is no question, the President and I and others in the government of some of the things that happened almost by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so, even in the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, goes back to 9 / 11."
Then he became the first high-ranking member of the US government that the US spying have crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: "In some cases, the inappropriate has gone too far."
The president is determined to create clarity, and therefore a thorough investigation so that no one must have the feeling that abuse.
I can assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and have been saved many lives through its surveillance operations.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up in the air."
There is a radical extremism in the world, which is keen to kill people to blow up in the air and attacking governments.
So what if we would be able to intercept and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented attacks on buildings, plane crashes and the killing of people, because we have learned in advance of such plans.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe, in order to dispel the doubts about the alleged American espionage and to convince Europeans of the need for the anti-terror efforts continue to cooperate with the United States, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, said that he had spoken this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other persons and is concerned about their threats not to participate because of frustration over the surveillance by the National Security Agency to anti-terror organizations.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism remain on board," said Murphy, who is in the Senate for the first time as a democrat and as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European affairs, and, in an interview in Washington.
Moreover, I go to Europe, in order to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger about the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe, have strained relations with some US allies, although the head of the secret service said this week that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents provided by Snowden further that the NSA had monitored the cellphone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state leaders around the world.
The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the spying on allies as necessary and said that this was customary on both sides.
In all the uproar, Murphy said that his agency is preparing the journey of the Congress, which is due to take place this year, and hoped the delegation will include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other MPs are to be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact itinerary will be worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip is to improve the improvement of relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words."
He said that the European governments would have to be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs that they themselves for years.
"We can change our surveillance programs and better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, stands for John Kerry over the weekend, a trip to the Middle East and to Poland, to deal with the resentment over the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott have conflict of interest with parental leave
The billionaire and Members of says Clive Palmer, Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest in his plans to leave because his daughters become pregnant and therefore could benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $6 million in carbon tax, the assertion that he wanted to brush aside questions about whether he is in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether the carbon and mining taxes be cut or.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers may have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would benefit personally from the laws.
"He is a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not they will leave," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission said Palmer with 53 votes ahead after the recount the winner of the Sunshine Coast-seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a review of the process of counting, so that he can go faster.
Tony third daughters Frances and Bridget.

Palmer also criticized the use of pencils with marking the ballot.
You use it, because then you can wipe out the results, if they do not like one?
Today vote with pencils is unbelievable.
The Election Commission has examined the options for an electronic voting and recently published a joint proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that his policy is an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and that he will take his new post "very seriously."

ESA decides on large space missions: Missions for billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Distant worlds.
More than 1000 planets around other stars, astronomers have already found.
Whether there is at least some of them, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: One is to look for gravitational waves?
Or prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or searching for Earth-like planets and perhaps discovering alien life?
These questions are the leaders of the European Space Agency ESA.
For its program "Cosmic Vision" they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to advance the research.
The budget for such missions "l" is about a billion euros.
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, met in Paris, the elite of European space research, to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were discussed, five of which are now in the final round.
Many bodies examine the proposals, according to the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision by the scientific program committee.
A total of four major issues has chosen the Esa, to which the missions of the 2007 programme initiated "cosmic vision" to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes for the formation of stars from large clouds - and thus the formation of planets that orbit stars - they are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances can arise?
In order to investigate this issue will start in 2017, the space telescope "," with the 500 already known planetary systems in our neighbourhood.
The possibilities are limited, however, is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments astronomers erdähnliche planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and search for "biomarkers": Gases, which are seen as an indicator for biological activity.
How does the solar system?
Ultimately, this question is to say what conditions for the emergence of life.
Plays an important role in the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emanating from the system.
In our solar system, these processes can.
With the "solar Orbiter" Esa already has a mission of the M-class (the budget is around half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe will start in 2017 and observe surface and activity of the sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and its moons.
You want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
The Esa sees the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The probe "juice" (Jupiter Icy moons Explorer) begins its journey to 2022.
Eight years later they reached Jupiter and the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons Europa, Ganymede and.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The space offers many opportunities to study the matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the known laws of nature are still valid.
Maybe there are deviations, the physicists could point the way to a new theory that all known laws of nature.
How the universe was created and what is it?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the usual from the stars, planets and life as we are, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy, which is the expansion of the.
So far, the researchers do not know what physical laws of physics in the first of the Big Bang 'split second were valid, is dark matter and dark energy.
"Euclid" the Esa has already been approved by a mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope to probe the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky, and thus allow conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals will remain at the end of the selection process only two.
The best chances of approval as a mission, according to many experts "E-Lisa," a sophisticated concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
Among physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
They were not detected.
Elisa could create the, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides two or three probes existing detector, which is stationed in space.
He could, in contrast to plants on Earth's gravitational waves, which are in the Big Bang, and thus provide new insights into the origins of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are competing for the second L-mission: A large X-ray telescope called "Athena," which, among other things, is to explore black holes, "icy planets," another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism," a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder" to detect and investigate the erdähnliche planet.

On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies for children in schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the US, as the number of school children with food allergies.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The prevalence of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines provide information for schools, the faculty and staff to raise awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children who are allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools Epinephrin stock - the auto-injection of the brand EpiPen is most commonly used in order to deal with a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The legislators in the federal states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin easier.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms that are called by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say: "It feels as if something is on my tongue," "my tongue feels as if a hair on my tongue," or "tickles."
Firefighters called to the rescue of a Hündchens, 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous cliff in a quarry was stranded
Cockerspaniel dog Ruby was gone after a minor traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a dog in the quarry in their predicament
Firefighters seilten rock wall and saved the dog before the safe death
Firefighters managed to bring a little dog in security, which was stranded on a high ledge in a rock wall.
The nine-month old Cocker Spain - dog Ruby was gone after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived alone, three days before it was rescued on Wednesday from a quarry.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend, Becky Hall, 20, which includes the dog, came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, Ruby again and to thank the firefighters of West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had searched desperately for their missing dog and cries in social networks, when she was bolted after the small road accident in the quarry.
At approximately 14: 15 p.m. on Wednesday saw a walkers, said his dog, Ruby stranded on the 15-meter-high sales in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and seilte to rescue Rubys, which was then transported in a Hundebox upwards.
Andy Clayton, a specialist of technical rescue team, said: "She was in a dangerous situation.
It was in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters away from the top and the bottom.
They moved a muscle during their rescue – she was frozen stiff.
But now it is good.
Then she has eaten a couple of dogs.
It was a very unusual.
The fact that the dog was discovered, is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, a specialist of technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a giant luck."
There was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian to investigate, but said nothing except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "When watching the rescue was scary."
I could not believe that she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them back to the poor.
The vet said that if the exhaustion has become too big and it would have collapsed, they would probably crashed.
The firefighters have done an outstanding job.
It was really brave, what they have done.
We are just so grateful and each one of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid that they would fall, but they remained above."
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe, where she was.
U.S. border: "Super tunnel" discovered the drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered a "super-tunnel" for drug smuggling and.
As the US customs authorities, was the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, seized eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel was, according to the data has not yet been taken.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they can get away by digging under the radar," said the general prosecutor of the Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where it was discovered at the end of the tunnel.
At the drug gangs assured Duffy: "If you continue to build such tunnels and trying to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-running battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77, 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with the drug-related crime.
Constructed by experts
Because of the expensive equipment of the tunnel, the investigators estimate that it was designed by architects and engineers, and that the construction took about a year.
The track was so that they could be used electrically powered cars.
On the Mexican side of the access in a building that is 80 meters away from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters in depth to the tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters wide.
He would have to encourage illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects have been arrested in connection with the cocaine-Fund.
The third, a Mexican, was taken because of the confiscated marijuana.
All three face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it said at the press conference in San Diego.
But it is the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in small quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of drug gangs, whose traditional routes are now cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug searches in San Diego.
They would do everything to get to the United States.
The detainees were given no details, at least one is Mexicans, it said.
They must count on prison sentences of up to ten years.
Obama's climbdown in health policy
After intense criticism, President Obama yesterday backed down on his oft-repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a letter of resignation, Republicans cast the president in the last few days, he had misled the American public.
Yesterday, Obama watered down its original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance, can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports about the dismissals, Obama called for those Americans who have received such messages to look for a new insurance on the open market.
Most citizens could get a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than received.
"You get a better offer," he said.
The government called it a little surprising that the five per cent of the population who have completed an insurance would have to look for another tariff, as their contract does not meet the new standards after the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say that Americans very directly: They deserve better," Sebelius said at a hearing before the Energy and Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online platform since October "abysmal."
"I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I am determined to regain your confidence.
This is a seated behind her manager at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was taken after a dispute with the Republican legislators Billy Long from Missouri. It was a question of whether it should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing Long Sebelius repeatedly pressed on the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily to a state-sponsored insurance, in order to complete a at HealthCare.gov, she now wants to sell millions of Americans.
Parents can choose children ""
Germany is the first European nation, in which a third sex is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitalia.
Newborn will no longer rigidly assigned male or female.
Under the new law, parents must be no more sex for such children, but "vague" or "not" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents, so that they do not have to make hasty decisions on operations for a gender assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against the people.
A intersexuelle person, according to BBC years later said: "I am neither man nor woman."
I remain a patchwork quilt, which was created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year, either as a boy or a girl.
They belong to the, a group that fall under the diagnosis "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson was perhaps more.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States, you should use the best available information on gender assignment if a provision is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child, before you decide - if any - for an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said that the new German law "blade for a good cause."
Sexual interaction children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical procedure, but for most children are not," he said.
It could be a gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the developing identity.
The scientific data about how a child develops at all his gender identity, are not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It is like the mystery of why people are gay.
In a report to the European Commission in 2011, it says, sexual people are transsexual and transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but by their biological constitution, which is neither male nor female exclusively, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These properties were in sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia or chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced intersexuelle and transgender people in professional life and about the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Not consistent with the image of gender boys now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults on official documents, male, female or "third sex" reported.
In June, Australians Norrie May-Welby (52) as the world's first "gender-free" person, after a court had granted the maintenance of a "unspecified" gender status.
German identity cards besides M and W, in a third allocation, in addition to the future, X for sexually, the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, as a news story on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school textbooks.
The US Catholic Online website has also spoken out against the German law, saying: "If the world is being dragged into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we twist two other pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told baby zone, it would be better if babies will be assigned to a sex at birth.
"The parents existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said of the parents' website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children who were born with both male and female parts, called Hermaphroditen, after the Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, the medicine regarded sex as something that you can wipe out and then rebuild.
But in the meantime, questioned the ethical foundations of an operation now is the gender identity, and that doctors can be wrong, because they do not know how the child at the turn of the sex of their allocation.
"In the middle of the 20th century, we called this a" psychiatric emergency, "said Drescher.
If such a child was born, then called the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who took the view that sex is malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental initiatives, such as the parents educate a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and characterized as to whether a person is male or female.
But in one under the title "John / Joan" case from 1966 his theories have been controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision to neuter the child and to remove his testicles and keep him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, but he did not," says Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
With 38 but he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of this sex operations to the public, who are "not happy with the result."
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris, or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a satisfying life "as a man.
So external body and testicles were removed shortly after birth in 1976, and he was brought up as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew that I am not a girl," he said on ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginoplasty.
But because he was depressed and knew that something was amiss, he asked for his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilised am birth - and no one has ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD, through his body could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals.
After he had told the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had to remove his breasts.
The operation, he has become infertile.
Today he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project for sexual people are perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based rights group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law "could" encourage stamping and.
"Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child, not to", "she explained.
We fear that favours intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still do not know how the law will impact, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law because "it allows adult recognition as a third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
The German law is about the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight, which should be small children at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide on their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radio login from Pitt, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law "authorize" both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete Androgenresistenz.
Because of the target cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.
Today, Katie 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a co-worker in the child psychiatry.
Although she is infertile, but hopes to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents room, so they do not have to make hasty decisions," said Baratz.
It gives them the time to make various tests and to clarify things and gives them more time before they write "male" or "female".
In this way, everything is in order, the child and loves it.
It was a wonderful baby and enjoys the parental happiness.
And we must not rush to make an operation that will not.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that the parents, because they believe that they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the sex, which is more suited to him - and it is wonderful.
This will be able to make the decision themselves.
Excellent mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "the Old Man and the Sea," Horst Janson is cut to the body.
Janson itself is an old hand in his profession, the Performing Arts.
The old man Santiago, no one can fool the fish.
So the two complement each other.
It almost feels to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, from which the fishermen young Manolo.
If Santiago tired of life on the chair, that is when Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman and a character role excellently Janson.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and eventually wins through his knowledge and his will to win the battle against the fish.
Janson is in many respects as the only on the stage.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience, so that his monologues are no moment boring.
His efforts to bring the fish to the surface of the water, are so real that viewers forget that there is a sea of blue lights water bottles.
Director Jens Hassel man leaves the old man in the boat from the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he is the most active scene into the light: The the of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise favor with their songs and her beautiful voice of life in Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and at the same time, guests at the bar.
Fancy ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British businessman has developed the first in the dark luminous ice – with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis, the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous bounties.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on jellyfish and was able to convince Chinese researchers artificially bright protein.
The ice cream responds to eat with the tongue, making the pH value in the protein and the lights.
Chris says that the response to the heat in the mouth and the more you licks, the lighter it.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," says: "The product is unbelievable, but still at a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue with a neutral pH value.
If the mouth warms the protein, the pH and the ice.
We have tested it in recent months, and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market, because it has this wonderful Leuchteffekt.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream, which I have ever made, because the fluorescent jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
Every ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
His experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is to be more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
That in itself is impossible because of the refraction, which is caused by the ice crystals of ice cream, but I suspect that we will find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, which are produced by Chinese scientists artificially
Salem: Johanna Rahner the Ecumenical discussion forum
At the next World discussion forum on Monday, October 21, at the New Museum of the castle is the subject of "to hell with the hell - theological reflections on today's handling of the last things."
She is professor Joan Rahner.
The Ecumenical discussion forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant churches Salem Salem, the castle and the culture ministry Lake Constance.
Johanna Rahner wants to look in the forum of the question, as the "last things" after the death of the people.
The people in the last few centuries knew too much and put on those images of heaven and hell, "which still shape our ideas," says reaching the contemporary prophetic teachings of the hopes of completing a degree of embarrassment or even silence.
"The greater hope Christians and Christians has been exorcised by the criticism of religion," says the officer.
"You have provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation point seem to be lost."
Johanna Rahner says: "But the key challenge remains the nuisance of death."
This is the question of desire, "the dreams that everything will be good at the end."
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied from 1982 to 1989 Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg.
She earned her doctorate in 1997, Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for fundamental theology and Ecumenical theology was followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has a chair for systematic theology at the Institute of Catholic theology at the University of Kassel.

Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel's patents
The group, which owns thousands of Nortel's patents, strengte on Thursday, an avalanche of complaints for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company, the bankruptcy auction of Nortel was outbid by him.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rock star is located in the community ownership of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents affect technology, put on the Internet searches in accordance with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which is the heart of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, HTC, Huawei and Rockstar were not immediately reachable.
Samsung, HTC and Huawei produce mobile phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in sharp competition on the mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google gave an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and offered $4.4 billion.
After it was outbid on the Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was motivated in part by Motorola's library of patents.
"Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the lawsuit patents at the auction, Google has violated patents and continues to do so," according to the complaint.
Rockstar carries a high compensation of Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement was intentional, the accusation.
Frankfurt parking fees to rise strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon be sensitive more expensive.
The magistrate advises the city this morning on a template of Verkehrsdezernent Stefan Majer (Green).
The parking fees should be increased by 50 percent.
But it should not raise the prices, but will be the time interval of parking watches and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city must then decide.
The retail committee of the Chamber of Commerce holds the Frankfurt "is not a good idea."
The parking directly in front of the business was "a significant advantage for smaller retailers."
The Transport Club Germany believes that an increase in two decades "entirely appropriate and long overdue."
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Oil prices are up to $96 per barrel
The price of oil has fallen even further on Friday, after concerns about a high offer overshadowed a report that the energy-hungry China's manufacturing sector is growing.
The Referenzrohoelsorte for deliveries in December had fallen in the late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price drop of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday, the United States had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer was increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there were signs of stronger demand by two reports of an increase in activity in the Chinese manufacturing.
This suggests a continued recovery of China's economy, whose growth has risen to 7.8 percent in the third quarter, after it was reached in the previous quarter to the lowest level in two decades.
The variety of Brent crude oil, a benchmark for international crude oil, which is also used by U.S. refineries, fell on the ICE Exchange in London at 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel.
The disposable society does not think
The night was long, loud music and the mood is good, but at some point, it is home.
In the bellies of the people on the passenger and back seat of hunger.
Clearly, a cocktail or champagne may be responsible for it.
What is more natural than chilled to drive to the next Drive-In to take a bite?
I admit that I am happy with it, if it is late at night or early in the morning to fast food-fetching.
A few fries, a Coke and a burger - and then as the home and go to bed.
But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco Gängern.
What must be missing that constant regularity of its fast-food bags from the car window?!
Especially at the weekends discarded paper bags around streets and parking lots.
"Why?," I wonder.
The people are too stupid to take the bags home or until the next dustbin?
It is not just that the landscape disfigured the paper.
Bags have also been concealed transport facilities such as crash barriers and triggered accidents.
So what does this "disposable society" but not, presumably, they do not even know what that word means.
If it is more often, especially with several people in the car, you know how to take a back seat after all nights: Clothes, bottles and other garbage are there.
There were a few bags more or less, but nothing - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to eat the remains of other rumtrampeln.
I can already see the day when the cities and communities to dopey removal - and the fast-food chains for their bags.
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegane diet requires herbal alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Pürierter tofu cream with plants, for example, is a Quark replacement.
Further calls Vegetarierbund Weltvegantag on November 1.
The Vegetarierbund Germany proposes on the occasion of the Weltvegantags on November 1, a series of vegan alternatives:
Pure Flora margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt will be replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy,, rice or almond milk can be used.
Aufschlagbare plants replace conventional whipped cream.
Also there are herbal alternatives to eggs.
Half a crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also Apfelmus 50 grams of apple sauce or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for them.
Soft doughs instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of starch and three Esslöffeln mineral water.
But even 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can serve this purpose.
According to the vegan Vebu feed is currently around 800000 people in Germany, so.
A black box in the car?
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe the solution to be found in a small black box, the space in the dashboard of each car.
The devices, which record and report the information to the authorities, the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the federal states to review the outdated system of financing American roads.
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarian have allied themselves with environmental groups and that the government of the small boxes to record mileage - and, possibly, where they were driven and then use the information for the calculation of modest tax.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a series of data protection concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states wait no longer.
They are looking at how they can switch to a system over the next ten years, in which drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have the tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS tracking, already tested.
This really is a must for our country.
"There is nothing that we will only use may be," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of government, which is planning a record of driven miles in all California motorists in the federal state in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes, will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes that Americans pay at the pump is broke.
But in America is no longer as much fuel as before.
Cars use less gasoline.
The state petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to high fuel prices, raising the tax by a penny.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," says Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic law at the University of Minnesota.
The federal government has recently 500 cars with black boxes, which are tested a mileage-based payment system.
"This is the most sensible alternative, in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it as a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea of urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence the behaviour that congestion and climate-damaging emissions to be reduced.
The Californian planners rely on the system in formulating policies that the ambitious, statutory objectives of the federal state on climate change.
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also declared that he is the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are taken with the idea to drivers pay zurückgelegter route.
"This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president for policy at the Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who had urged in a report to Congress in 2011 to move in the direction of mileage-based billing.
The US Senate last year approved a $90 million expensive pilot project, which includes 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the thrust and responding to the concerns of MPs from rural areas, the people who in everyday life, often many miles on the way to work or in the city.
Several states and cities move on their own in this direction.
The most active is Oregon, which is currently enlists 5,000 drivers for the biggest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the federal government.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also is considering.
Illinois is testing it in a limited way with trucks.
And the I- 95 Coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently studying how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices, motorists were skeptical of the idea that the government could pursue its every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and product management at the Transport Ministry of Nevada.
The people did not want it.
As the trial started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to transform the tachograph in mature monitoring devices."
There was no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology, with which the state can collect the mileage, but not exactly when and where.
Thus, Khan, the public would be some.
The hunt for this technology has some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.
The company is not originally started to help states in the taxation of drivers.
Rather, it was their goal to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, in which drivers based on the basis of miles.
But the devices are also tested for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, which are regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, managing director of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs big mistakes have been made.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with to give drivers a number of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they can choose any device and instead pay a flat fee based on the average of all the inhabitants of the federal state driven miles.
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by the devices with more features than with little.
In New York City traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation, which is also pay parking fees, insurance must be paid only for driving distances and speed data are collected by other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists would be the added value of the benefits of the system, motivated to participate," says a planning document of the city.
Some traffic planners, however, are wondering whether all this talk about paying per mile is not only a huge distraction.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of the San Francisco Bay officials declared that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by simply increasing the fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little gasoline, will be imposed, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no need for an operation, if an aspirin is enough," said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs of the Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists are concerned about their privacy and many other things.

Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany in terms of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the intelligence service, said that he is prepared to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag, if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander no answers about their activities.
The German MEP Hans-Christian Stroebele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum with him to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, who on Friday from the media in Berlin, writes: "Even if the result of my endeavours was demonstrably positive, my government is to be a dissenting opinion as loyalty and to criminalize political freedom of expression with criminal threat, no defence."
To tell the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden wrote that he was convinced that the support of the international community to convince the American government could drop the charges against him.
The by the US Department of Justice indictment includes espionage and theft of state property.
The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said over time online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to talk with German representatives, then we will find ways to make it."
Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained by the claims that the NSA had bugged the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MEP, who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service, said that we should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if this is possible, "without endangering him and ruining relations with the United States."
Stroebele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists.
Stroebele said that according to the lawyer of former NSA contractor Snowden could not return to Russia, if he leave the country.
If Snowden aussage in Germany, he will need an assurance that he was "sure" there, the Member.
Snowden said in his letter that he would face a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign, which was driven from his home.
However, he was touched by the global response to "my act of political freedom of expression."
People around the world, as well as senior politicians, including in the United States, described the revelations about an uncontrolled comprehensive monitoring system known as a credit to the public.
In his letter to Snowden, the German authorities an offer of cooperation, "if the difficulties have been resolved around the humanitarian situation."
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first president of Mozambique, in a rare public demonstration of peace.
"We want peace, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Out of fear for the future of the country, their business attire for a T-shirt with the inscription "We want security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on the Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement, more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, which was initially supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in a bid to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the peace treaty of 1992, she became an opposition party.
Analysts consider it unlikely that zurueckfalle the country back into a full-scale conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
For the fast-growing economy is a lot at stake, because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could in the next few years investments of more than $50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The ruling FRELIMO Party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo are blaming each other for the tensions.
RENAMO claimed that the government had provoked the recent clashes, it could have on October 17, its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold Renamos attacked.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated, when government troops attacked bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the group, said Renamos spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government is Renamo the blame for the clashes and accused the organization to have attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
He told AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regard themselves as "losers" who "wants to use all its remaining forces to prove that the government can impose its decisions."
Both FRELIMO and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.
But the concerns have grown since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was the 1992 peace agreement in.
He told the FT, he said that he had meant that FRELIMO no longer respect the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fueled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who heads collide," says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good in bargaining and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
RENAMO, which is pressing for electoral reforms, has already declared that it will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to ailing movement, concessions and financial incentives from the government.
Renamos electoral success since 1992, while a new party, headed by a former Renamo member Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claimed that Guebuza, whose resignation comes when his second term ends next year, wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to give up the presidency," said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo, but it has made disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south routes.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, Beira, but the port, mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.
In June, Rio interrupted a month for the use of the railways, after Renamo had announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat that threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
The instability has increased the frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, Head of Media Coop, an independent media company, because many people already worried about the corruption, the slow progress in development and a recent kidnapping wave of abduction.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
Omar sultans, a demonstrator, said that people simply wanted stability.
"Not FRELIMO and Renamo, they just want to restore peace and usable roads," he said.

Chinese newspaper to call "reform"
A Chinese newspaper, which had called on the front page of the release of a reporter who had been accused of defamation, should be reformed, according to a press regulator.
The New Express, based in Guangzhou had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen was later on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports on a teilstaatliche company.
Now the New Express will be subjected to a "comprehensive Rektifizierung," the regulator said.
The "Rektifizierunganordnung" came from the authority for press and publications, radio, film and television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yang Cheng Evening News Group, between September 2012 and August 2013 several inaccurate reports of the listed company Zoom Lion.

Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction equipment called Zoom Lion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two appeals for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win the confidence of the public," he told the state news broadcaster CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was on money and fame.
I realized that I was wrong.
In the wake of Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page and declared that they had failed to check the reports.
Various known suspects have recently on television confessions.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely, despite a change in the law at the beginning of the year, which was banned the authorities to force someone to blame themselves.

NSA declared that an "internal error" and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the website
The shadow National Security Agency said late Friday that a mistake had crippled its public website a few hours and not hackers, as has been claimed online.
"NSA.gov tonight was unavailable for several hours, during a planned updates an internal error," explained the spy agency in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be fixed on this evening.
The claim that the outage was carried out by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack caused, is not true.
In the early evening hours online server sites noticed that the NSA website at least six hours, was not available and will continue for some users.
Previously, a spokesman for the NSA to ABC News, is the sensitive internal network of the authority was "in no way compromised."
Secret information were not in danger, according to the spokesman.
At least one group of the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target site with pages flooded until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
The cyber tactic is relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No search Agency (No such authority), was now finds himself in the bright light of the public and, in recent months after the reported revelations about their extensive surveillance program at home and abroad sharp criticism - a result of the secret NSA data from disaffected former NSA employee Edward Snowden stolen and published by the.
The growing controversy over the secret service modifying initial speculation about the incident today is the result of a targeted Cyperoperation.
Snowden could also testify in Russia

Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor could either ask questions in writing or the 30-year-olds personally in Russia.
The Interfax agency reported, citing named circles who are familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved between the state, it said.
Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually impossible.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted its source.

Children should be myths and legends as "role models for life," says the author.
The stories of Thor showed that "brutal force has no chance against clever tricks," and the Arthur legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are "far too wild, too offensive and, in some cases, too dirty to be taught in schools,", which is why Crossley-Holland for a "careful selection" age just works.
"I think it is wonderful that myths and folklore in America are already part of education," he said.
I have already proposed a plan for twenty years.
He added that authors and teachers who were "overly didactic," children "shut down completely," because in entertaining stories, the "subliminal messages."
Crossley-Holland, Beowulf translated from the Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: "You can pursue certain intentions, but we should keep them in the background."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults, and an author who writes for children, is the need to give hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an inherent sense of good and evil.
This must be presented subliminally, be revealed by the history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing rather than telling.

Tax on foreign property owners against London's speculative bubble
The Treasury has provisionally durchkalkuliert the CGT-measure, but still waiting for the final decision by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who had imposed a stamp tax in the 2012 budget of 7% on homes that cost more than two million pounds, as well as annual fees for buyers, the apartments as a company and not as individuals.

Cook said: "After the increase in the stamp tax on high-priced apartments and the introduction of legislation against the circumventing one can hardly say that high quality properties are taxed too low, despite the impact of the old county tax system."

The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book, and they reported on Thursday evening that the president Topberater "extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" had carried out to find out whether the appearance of Obama's dwindling hopes of re-election, if he let fall Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent for the Times, the book traces the history of the efforts of leading staff of the campaign and the White House, notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley to measure what effect it had on the poll numbers to replace the former Secretary of State Clinton against the vice president.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the closest advisers of the president, including Daley, Obama's former campaign manager, Jim Messina, and the former senior White House adviser David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew about the planned change.
In "double Down" is said, Daley had stood at the forefront of efforts to Biden, despite their "close, personal relationship" before eventually decided against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy "would not significantly improve the chances of Obama's."
In an interview with Martin Daley, confirmed that the government was considering to replace Biden by Clinton.
"I made a whole series of things that you should consider, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
We must remember that the President had terrible poll numbers, so we thought: "For God's sake, what do we do?"
While Daley described the investigation as "due diligence,", said Martin to Anderson Cooper of CNN that had been operated during the campaign for the re-election of considerable effort to find out whether such a move to the ballot box auszahle.
"In campaigns is not spent so much money on surveys and focus groups, if you don't think seriously about something," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange.
Martin said on CNN, he asked Daley whether his former boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley said that he does not believe that the President of the possible change was "aware" the former chief of staff, admitted that it was "possible" that Obama did not know about it.
Martin added that "double Down" deliver a definitive answer to the question of whether the political soundings have reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously think that Obama did not know of the inquiries about whether to drop Biden in the elections.
"Possible," said Martin.

Verzweiflungs cry of an Obama voter
I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change is possible
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the blocking tactics by Republicans
The blockade policy does not apologize the website problems of Obamacare, the drone strikes
Obama's memoir about the 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I read a terribly sad book.
It is a book that I thought it would be sad during the second year medical student cheering up and give me hope.
It is called "the Audacity to Win" (courage to win) and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election.
In the evening, I am finished with my patients transcripts and go to bed, then the book brings me back to a time when the policy inspired millions and.
The election was a landslide victory and the to lead the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers that they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
Obama into office in 2008, he had approval voting values of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switch back to the present is a rude awakening, as if it is from a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a faint memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I made my voice for the first time, something has changed.
But there is simply nothing that I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved by the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance until the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the partisan blockade tactics have too many efforts, with whom our nation should be brought forward: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after countless times, I have defended the Obama administration to colleagues and friends, I am with my point at the end.
I have reached a point of political desperation.
The Republican obstructionism cannot explain why it allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers should be punished, the government misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki was an American citizen, was killed without trial, nor why the public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report, which says that the efforts of the White House to restrain the media are the "most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
And the most recent cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I do not know if that is what I should have expected.
If I have to understand that the government could contradict the previous political campaigns.
Apparently, the is not a predictable course Abgeordnetenamt, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public debate.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I was re-elected in 2012, Obama, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative, he seemed not its direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hopes that we had heard for so long.
But with the drop in approval ratings for Obama to below 45% this week to return to 2008 through this book.
It makes me the desire for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.
This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama has had a heavy loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with election officials after the decision, he told his staff, they would have to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
There are five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree with you more.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.

The citizens Pfullendorfs must adapt to higher electricity costs.
As the director of the municipal works, Jörg-Arne bias, confirmed to the SUEDKURIER, on a four-member Pfullendorfer family costs 70 to 90 euros per year.
The main reason of the forthcoming price increase is the rise in the so-called EEG levy of 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is fixed every year in October by the four operators of the major electricity lines.
