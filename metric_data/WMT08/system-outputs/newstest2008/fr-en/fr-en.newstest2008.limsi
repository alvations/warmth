The official forecasts indicated that 3 percent, gave Bloomberg.
Unlike the US central banks, British, Canadian and European Central Bank (ECB) has not fallen, the rate of intéret director saying that falling interest, with price growth of matieres premieres and reduce unemployment, would the generation has an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would maintain the inflation rate below but close to two percent.

Gallup indicates a government crisis
Tough a long stagnation, the number of supporters of the Fidesz (Alliance of Democrats) has significantly increased beginning December and since 2002, it currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup Institute (poll) has never seen before such a weak Socialist support, which has 13 percent.
Fideles for the voters, the difference would be, because of the determination of the opposition, support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of a cinquieme (20 percent) to MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the Forum (MDF Hungarian Democrats) and SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of Members: their support is two percent in the whole population.
On the fideles some voters to vote, the number of supporters of both parties rose by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate compared to the previous low point, the proportion of those who judged that the country's economic situation was particulierement serious has never been so high, it was has 41 % and according to 46 % complementary the situation is quite serious.
Tough prospects more optimistic of spring and summer of recent, families are again more pessimistic about their situation has financiere.
For next year, the majority of the population is growing and only a dixieme envisages improving the situation.
In December, 71 percent of people polled, a majority has never seen in previous polls by Gallup, found that the prime minister was his work rather badly as well.
13 % of those polled have confidence and trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 % support Viktor Orbán.
54 % are not all confidence in Prime Minister and 27 % of Fidesz.
A indicators of change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that the discontent with Prime Minister can be treated without change of government.
While after the riots of last October, 35 % of those polled thought that the government and the prime minister remains in office, now this rate is only 20 percent. The relative majority (33 percent) believe the holding of new elections would be the solution has this situation.
To the question on the intention to vote, 60 % of those polled respond that they would certainly vote and the additional 20 % say they would probably vote.
To compare, for a "organise legislative election next Sunday," only 55 percent of those polled certainly participate and 15 % complementary probably would participate. Following the Current intentions, the outcome of the referendum would no doubt.
74 % of people say no to fees in higher education, 79 % say no to the costs of consultation and 84 % say no accommodation expenses has hospital.
When we look at just the memes proportions among those who have expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 % of voters would reject the introduction of fees, consultation fees and expenses residence has hospital.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices of almost 20 %
The hypermarkets implanted in the triangle of Budaörs commercial kept the average increase in prices of 16 % last year was the difference that this year the rate of VAT has not increased.
Article of Napi Gazdaság (daily Economy)
This year, in the triangle of Budaörs Panier, the usual daily Christmas has increased to 16 % on average, increased substantially higher value thousand Forints sported is in all hypermarkets.
The price, "who had already flown" in department stores of food in December, have risen more brutally by report has the previous high.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that Articles bought clearly below nine thousand Forints last year coutent now ten thousand Forints.
The Panier daily life in the hypermarkets exceeded those polled 91 Forints of at least the psychological threshold of ten thousand Forints.
And the highest value stood basket of Forints has 10 573.
(In 2003, this value was 6 Forints 800.)
The price of the Unicum and fish living remained almost at the level of last year, but the net price Turkey, walnut and poppy have significantly increased.
In the shops, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Statistiques Central Institute of) but, Auchan, home found bread a kilo has 139 Forints only.
Competition has not dropped the product price below 200 Forints.
It was surprising, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the bottle recorded two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 Forints coutait, it does so Forints 257 recorded the bottle is understood.
He empeche that this year in term of Panier daily, Auchan was the most expensive and cheapest Cora.
According to our calculations, Cora has increased the price of its Panier 15 % daily while the Auchan and Tesco rose respectively by approximately 18 and 18 percent.
Comparing the basket the more expensive last year and the basket the cheaper this year, we see a gap of 12 % while the difference between the least expensive last year and the more expensive this year is 21 percent.
Prices have risen 1 480 Forints on average.
Last year, prices have risen 1 206 Forints on average, knowing that the impact of the rate of VAT was already noticed in the prices of Christmas last year.
This process has been perplexed trade, hypermarkets could not determine obviously apply on the margin of products they were unable to predict the impact of the change in prices on consumption.
(If a retailer is not the rotation of a product, it risks losing a big profit margin on the appropriate has the intensity of Trade.)
Because of the change of VAT rates, increasing the price of Panier newspaper has changed so much that the most expensive basket was above 720 Forints 1 has the value of the 2006 while the difference between baskets at 844 was only Forints.
This year, the difference was not if excessive since the value of the basket was more expensive than 630 Forints 1 was that of last year and cheaper prices have increased 1 284 Forints also.
By bringing the two Christmas seasons, we found a catastrophic increase prices, less than 20 months the prices of everyday consumer goods rose by more than 30 % in the hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirms the data of KSH alimentations: for some, the statistics institute found a price increase of more than 30 % in 12 months.)
Such is the case of flour and egg.)
According to the Panier newspaper, that seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already expensive last year has increased from just over 10 % has the basis.
According to the meal providers are stronger than the egg suppliers because they have to accept the sharp increase in prices also by multinationals.
In the Golden Triangle Trade, the hypermarkets do not complain, they are constantly good years.
In our experience, the majority of customers do look more prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They achetent while quantity, they take the food long-life by pellets.
Wednesday morning of important tails have formed the coffers of the three hypermarkets because the number of customers increased suddenly.
According to our information, the turnover is less important province, many multinationals complain to the polling companies did not achieve the turnover expected, not only for food but also for Articles of sustainable consumption.
Many hospitals are the economy on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, caused mainly by the improper use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The hospital hygiene, the insufficient number of beds, overtiredness medical staff do not help has block infection, says the chief doctor at the National Centre of Epidemiology.
Many hospitals are also the economy on disinfectants
There is no longer an infection MRSA has been diagnosed in traumatologie János Hospital.
The bacteria resistant to antibiotics was detected on a man hospitalised following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The wounded a serious car accident left the hospital but shortly after it has return there because of an infection MRSA and since, doctors could not make him a major operation because of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December this year, 1 hospitalieres infections 094 generated by an agent pathogene multirésistant were declared the national Systeme monitoring nosocomiale, said Böröcz Karolina, chief doctor of the National Centre of Epidemiology.
That is the number of infections caused by an agent pathogene multirésistant who really has been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Around two-thirds infections (683) infections were caused by the MRSA, i.e. the Staphylococcus aureus by resistance has the méthicilline-oxacilline.
A third of people are carrying the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (the company) in their nose without it develops a disease.
Infection caused by the SA (such as angines, amygdalites, skin infections, infections traumatic) react well to antibiotics, they are easily guérissables.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriate., the bacteria, which responds well to antibiotics, develop a good bacteria resistant to antibiotics which proliférera quickly in the poor hospitalieres.
In case of bad or extended interim functioning of the immune system, the bacteria can cause serious hospitalieres infections, such as a traumatic infection or a septicémie on the sick, elderly, small weight or have a weakened body.
According to the doctor Hospital's director János, there is nothing particular infection MRSA infections, these are parts of the newspaper hospitals.
Above all, we must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, there is not only of MRSA or they are not seeking, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The SA resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, nurses floats rubber gloves and masks and we have appropriate antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, patients in hospitals are examined whether they carry MRSA infection, but cannot always be avoided.
The prélevement of the sample is not the way
Most injuries caused by MRSA could be prevented but conditions and the circumstances are not good, Hungarian hospitals, to prevent the development and proliferation of agents pathogenes multirésistants Karolina Böröcz, says.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and the elderly homes, hospitals should monitor patients in hospitals and immediately isolate the sick carrying MRSA.
However the prélevement microbiological is not the way in hospitals Hungarian.
That national club Social Security is not financing these tests.
Most cases can be enacted if the infection MRSA is detectable on the patient, said the doctor in charge of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has stringent recommendations relating has the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian directives for cures for certain infections and syndromes.
We must make efforts for the antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be made to empecher resistance to drugs but hospitals do not always take account.
The prélevements microbiological is even more rare in the ambulatoires and care in the basic care, gave Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals are the economy on disinfectants
Scientific evidence suggests that the proliferent MRSA of a patient has another most often by medical staff.
It is therefore important to wash their hands, putting gloves and masks. But important shortcomings are detected in hospitals also in this area.
The proliferent by MRSA infection transmitted by inhalation of gouttelettes and by contact. But because of the conditions in hospitals, the patient Hungarian contaminated cannot always be isolated.
Moreover, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in term of epidemic, patients should be far apart 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also note that hospitals, financiere difficult situation and make savings on disinfectants, they are infirmieres, patients are many, and the risk of contamination is even greater, Karolina Böröcz said.
Karolina Böröcz in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is more demonstrably weak or the proliferation of pathogene agent can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of infection MRSA is exorbitant expenditure for the coffers of Social Security, that is why we fight against the infection.
In England, for example, the government has established a programme to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to data published, this programme is effective and infection MRSA show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reveals among its priorities preventing the incidence of agents pathogenes multirésistants (as also MRSA) and the prevention of hospitalieres infections caused by these agents pathogenes.

Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the paradise of golf attractive Europe and be a prime destination after the season of summer and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
Investors more vigilant achetent already in great numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria seek simultaneously has changed their lives, their way of life.

Fodor and six percent Hungarian
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, minister of the environment and water, the meetings of professionals is achevent Tuesday, yet Wednesday, after the official opening negotiations, the ministers on the regime of international climate after 2012 will continue.
The experts and politicians arriving from 192 countries of the world will discuss on the Roadmap to Bali meant to define the effort has done after the period of reducing emissions defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
Currently, lively discussions are conducted has this subject between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also pointed out that for the moment, they do not wish to discuss exact figures, but they were Prets has signed an agreement on the reduction, until 2020, the gas emissions has greenhouse effect of 25 has 40 % compared with 1990.
Another important issue of the conference is to see if the developed countries commit, outside reducing emissions, provide financiere and technological assistance to countries in need.
A signed agreement also has on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund set by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a board composed of 16 members probably under the Global Fund for UN Environment (GEF), gave Piac és Profit Market Profit (and).
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, minister of the environment and water, confirms the EU's ambition to keep its flagship role in the overall efforts designed to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The minister explained that the EU has committed before 2020 reduce gas emissions of greenhouse gases has 20 % from the levels reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the Agreement "after 2012", and it was prete has cut up has 30 % if the other large parts of the world and / or developing countries were also has Prets commitments has adapted their responsibility and their capabilities.

Hungary has pledged to reduce emissions has greenhouse effect of 6 % in the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfil his commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministere environment.
The stakes are high because the Bali has international agreement on long-term climate policy must be implemented in two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments below the values laid down in the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately followed a new international system of emissions reductions, which was highlighted in the new report by IPCC, international scientific body, which received the Nobel Peace Prize to the UN, to look at climate change.
Reducing emissions would be delayed and increase the average temperature of the Earth more 2 degrees celcius could not be avoided, according to scientists, extremement would have serious consequences and unchangeable.

Political Capital: Hungarian Guard has increased the risk country
According to the Division of risk analysis of Political Risk Capital (Analysing) Division, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, in August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for Better Hungary) increases, in many respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In his "warning of danger", the company says that, in connection with the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the largest political risk is already " has short-term aggressive ethnic clashes can result has exacerbating ethnic tension between the existing gypsy population and not Gypsy Hungary. "
The research institute added that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard aimed probably has cause this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is a major shortcomings of politicians, "Hungarian public operators have gone public debate on the matter has Roma representatives of radical political groupings and extremes that have a political strategy based on the dispute between Roma and the Hungarians."
The problem worsened, the normal dialogue impossible, extremists are strengthened and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
According to the research institute under the attention of Hungarian and international media activity Hungarian Guard "has deteriorated significantly Hungary has abroad, particularly on confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country."
They recall that following has greater publicity has given the reorganisation of radical groups and extremes Hungarian right-wingers since the autumn 2006, numerous associations were produced in Hungary since summer 2007 is giving the National Association of self-defence. "
"The common feature of these rallies is they define themselves as a civil organisation while they publicly declare preparing their members has defence missions (disasters, national defense, defense of the next), armed, moreover, alleging ineptitude of the police, the army, of the state," they added.
They said that everything was happening after the method, taking the resentment of society and political parties, seeks has disguising various political ambitions under a civilian.
The emphasis on the caractere and the civil statute of association is therefore only that pieges has avoided legal registration of these associations in court but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor which also increases the risk for neighbourly relations.
" These last months, many neighbors Hungarian Guard cite as a potential source of risk and political actors ultranationalists of some neighboring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy in referring to the Constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influence the political stability of the region, " they added.
According to the Research Institute, the Constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phénomene in Central Europe to the east, the political risks have increased on the entire region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard looks, for example, has the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many Roma unrest that have occurred in a neighborhood of Poljana Sofia (Kraszna) are the origin of the Constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
Taking these events, the BNU decided to be a warning by saying that the objective of the organization is "national self-defense."
According to them, the last 17 years, Gypsies have "terrorised" Bulgaria but the state remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had aroused lively debates in the Bulgarian public.
As they say, the statement of certain organisations of Bulgarian Roma on their own guard as a resistance would increase the risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with the Bulgarian National Guard does not excluded that Roma Hungarian react the threat of the same way by organising their own self-defence, warning of the risk of Political Capital.
At the request of information the agency Attila Juhász briefly, research director of Political Capital, said: the analysis of risk is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
As he said, their analysis of risk is published every year and if events occur that could have an impact on the change of risk, they inform the public, as now, by issuing a warning of risk.
The fete is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the days of fete and around fetes, it has become commonplace to reshape the working days whose number will decline next year.
The fetes are not uniform in the EU and the United States.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes the fete days of national and state and the rest days.
The rest days are often related has fetes or religious events history.

It is true that we are paying the price of the prolonged weekend working or going has school Saturday before the weekend extended.
For years, the labour minister statue in a particuliere on the days of replacing days before or after the fetes.
The law extends to all employers and their employees for all employees, officials and people working in public service.
It is not however for the services companies, institutions and turning point without interruption in service by their vocation, and also for the rest days.
This year, the days of work will be modified only around fetes Year: has the 24 December, life is being driven almost throughout the country since the experiences most people rather overtime or takes vacations they have saved has these purposes to spend the days between Christmas and New Year home.
Next year a fetes fall in the middle or the end of the week, therefore there will be less changes in working days by report has this year.
The timetable will be rearranged the first time around the fete work to allow employees to stay home four days in a row.
The Samedi 25 April will be a day of work for a day of rest Friday 2 May.

However, next year, the end of the year is coming under the sign of the fetes has since from 24 December, everyone will pause nonstop even if the day of the New Year falls on a Wednesday.

If you want to meet the expectations, you are more interesting
Things move slowly in the usual matters in the morning.
Everything has shot, a particuliere melody vocal has radio: the voice of a violin has which electronic effects.
I played the sound.
Music of exchange rate and low comes to accompany the shade of any has now, then a female choir just join as a true jewel.
Mr2 diffuse the song Wings of Love of Zagar.
Hungarian musical life has long spoiled point with an electronic pop good quality.
But now it seems that matters is whether you different tapping the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, some interesting new products over the Hungarian Digital Underground begin Little has little has changed the overall picture and, despite the new way of garage rock of tearing the guitare électropop, the Hungarian proves that there is something new under the sun.
Zságer Balázs came to Pécs and he played himself in the Yonderboi group before he on his own way, can be - because "there is no place for two feet in a shoe."
Her project (Zagar) and music, included a of jazz music and dansante pop, has started to know when it was given the composition of the soundtracks (filmed buy)
The Ferenc Török season).
The training playing early in small clubs began to be known by a wider public when the magazine wan2 quoted their first album of 2002 among the 50 largest market discs Hungarian and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, almost the creators of the Hungarian trend which would also be competitive has West.
Zagar and his whole became undoubtedly "trendy" but nobody asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The group has responded, it has emerged a new and better record.
The album title Cannot Walk Fly Instead, emerged recently, can open new paths for them, although the title would represent continuity with the past Pécs years has.
It is that it was a line of former Pécs Group of Zságer Balázs.
We are well with the reference to the theft but has side air music now appears, following the spirit and the trend of the time, the guitare stronger impact of rock 'n' -roll.
Ligeti, singer György currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his skill in these songs at first the album at Millennium Park.
On the album, a tract true for radio, mr2 Petõfi, broadcast from little popular music from morning to evening began has introduce the Songs of Wings of Love registered with six chanteuses (Hungarian Divas "underground").
All is well therefore (?).
Hvg Hu. Raised questions Balázs has Zságer.
Hvg Hu:. This new leads me tract has put a question: is your music is remained music aimed some ozone?
Zságer Balázs: the term music aimed some ozone would not say great thing.
For me there are two castes in music légere; not mainstream or underground, no alternative or commercial music but pop music and sincere.
The music itself saying alternatives, underground can also be mediocre and made just to sell and become commercial.
Well, good pop song can also be sincere.
The attitude of receipt works in this spirit also regardless of language or Frontieres.
Hvg Hu.: do you see a difference between the public and Hungarian foreign, does one or the other is more open has your music?
Zs. B.: abroad, especially the West has music légere has more old traditions.
The people are going to concerts and not just the young of a dozen or vingtaines years and older.
They follow with much more attention to the changes in the music légere because they believe it is also part of contemporary culture.
Hvg Hu.: what is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested to know who or how many people are listening to your music?
Zs. B.: of course I am glad that people are increasingly has our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
For we music is not made to reach a goal but for a reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts or mutual influence already operates but it is perceived that changes in the elusive.
Well, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you will do more interesting.
Hvg Hu.: are you accounts follow the example of Yonderboi?
It works alone and carriere rather have the West.
Zs. B.: we do not really follow his path even if sometimes some are trying to find traces in our music.
Rather we are team players who have confidence in the musical presence and let the deployed.
In the beginning, it was obviously inevitable that our music is compared to the Yonderboi because we are several has leave his group and has taken a different path.
Hvg Hu.: on the palmares mr2 Petõfi, of Wings of Love is in first place.
Many have heard the name of Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this style more popular you're open consciously towards a broader layer?
Zs. B.: we have not provided a tract to sell records.
This song means more.
We wanted for the final album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the most difficult themes addressed in any records.
Hvg Hu.: how did you choose the six chanteuses?
Why they - what was the guideline?
Zs. B.: the idea was to have a gender gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good solistes of the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was composed the choir has six members, has know Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Péterfy, Bori Jay Hodosi, Enikõ [LEFT-BRACKET Juci], Neo Németh, was named then Underground Divas.
Hvg Hu:; you're wanted this song like that or girls have changed a little?
Zs. B.: this piece existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought it was still missing something has this song.
The result of agreements drew the voice of the song.
I have sung the night even the melody that girls have learned later.
I have had almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that I galvanized has the time but foolproof we took the Divas.
With my voice she would not have had the same force.
Hvg Hu:. On the disc together and it seemed to me that the girls were backwards plan.
There is no aria (has a solo run short of Judy Jay), they have no role only, they all sing together and they do not sing louder than the music, music is not that accompany their song.
They were derriere on the scene.
Is it wanted?
Zs. B.: the fact that they were back plan is the only has problemes techniques.
What was voluntary, it is that we did not distribute solo roles.
The song also said that we must forget a little our egos, forget just or going or, just that these wings, the Wings of Love, we win.
I wanted other feel equally euphoric that we felt when the song is born.
Hvg Hu:. Which songs you did the most work?
Zs. B.: indeed, no about the process of musical creation, we had pieces more difficult in the mixture.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I was playing a piano together, or with rock'n'roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove would not work for a long time, and then, small, everything is set up like a jigsaw puzzle.
Hvg Hu.: what is your preferred on the new album?
Zs. B.: it changes all the time with concerts and the fact that I 'failed' this disc.
Currently, Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and never the same.
The tradeur has risked treacherous billions because of his inferiority complex
A dissimulateur recalcitrant taxpayer.
And appoints its former employee the French giant General Company, owner of Czech bank Komer?ní banka.
The bank has lost because of him nearly five billion euros.
Now it seems rather than Kerviel is a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and, moreover, can not be seen as incapable.
Unlike all the giant bank, he acknowledged to time the market crisis of American mortgages.
"It is fragile," suggested superiors who have reported to the police.
However, according to the evidence of Kerviel reported by the French media, including Le Monde, the transactions of this man produced late last year a benefit amounting to EUR 1.6 billion.
The crisis exceeds the US
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in the evidence.
Last summer, he managed to take the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he sensed the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
Information has begun to emerge in February that the so-called "sub-prime mortgages," given to low-income customers or those who had met in the past difficulties of reimbursement, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel is not believed and he banked.
Thus, at the end of the year, profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I won my first half, I did not know how to announce it," Kerviel surrenders and adds that it has not kept to himself. "
In all the interrogation, he admits having distorted the reports not to be uncovered.
He has managed to dupe superiors, although the stock Eurex started to address its transactions.
Who risks nothing has nothing
He feared being discovered?
Rather than.
"I felt that just having reached 1.6 billion for the bank would meet."
Why has her willingness to risk if big?
It managed to his post gradually.
He started working at the General Society in 2000 having just finished his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary revolved around 51 thousand dollars.
Two years later, he was assistant to tradeur, and in 2005 he became tradeur with an independent annual salary of 90 thousand dollars.
Yet he knew that he would never do.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was far less than the other."
In view of my university curricula and my professional experience and personal, "said the Kerviel investigators."
However, shortly after taking office, he wins his first great success.
Thanks to Allianz actions, he won a billion euros on the reduction of this title at the London bombings.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As you gagnes, it leaves you in peace
"There was like a snowball," he told the police.
But the superiors were aware of all, or rather, they knew.
"While I gagnais, they were pretending to ignore."
But then comes the beginning of the year.
It loses EUR one billion a day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to overshadow the sum.
Monday, when he arrives at work, it is no longer employee of the bank.
A few days after the bank announced that it lost EUR 5 billion because of him.
And how is it has discovered?
It became suspicious because of its holidays.
"Last year I was only 4 days holidays."
A trader who is taking no holiday is a trader who does not leave his book to another, "Kerviel concluded."
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech Government signed in all nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could in years to come, make 14 billion euros (about 365 billion kronor Czech) to the Czech Republic.
It is roughly half the entire amount that the Czech Republic can obtain Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion kronor from seven operational programmes will Czech regions.
Czech companies can get around 100 billion kronor in Enterprise and innovation.
The transport sector will receive the largest share, up to 150 billion.
The programme Transport operational programme is the most important and represents up to 22 % of financial means that the Rép. can obtain Czech in these projects.
This money will be an increase in the budget of the National Fund transport infrastructure which will run next year a sum of 90,8 billion kronor.
The programme Enterprise and innovation, and SME entrepreneurs, must serve to obtain funds to encourage innovation within the company.
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new methods of management more efficient.
Until now, the Rép. Czech, was part of the new members, beneficiaries of EU funds the least successful.
The Court confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former president of Nicaragua
The Court of Appeal of Nicaragua confirmed Thursday the death of 20 years in prison for the country's former president Arnold Alemán, to which he was convicted in 2003 for a fraud of 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion kronor).
But later he was released and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former leader of the centre-américain, depending between 1997 and 2002, will again or not encarcéré is for the moment, according to the agency PA, not clear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Perez, everything will depend now prison officers, or they will leave Aleman finish his sentence at home, or go to prison again.
There are 4 years, the Court has proven qu´Alemán regularly shifted money into government accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
It was fictitious companies and the accounts were actually members of his family and closest supporters.
Some of this money has gone into the qu´Alemán fund was created to finance his campaign in 2001.
It has adopted the budget
It is.
The state budget was adopted.
What is this budget exceptional?
This is the first by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
For the year is spent a year from the Socialist Party supports the Czech?SSD, since the Minister Sobotka who had prepared and?SSD could not afford its refusal.
Unlike the troubled debate before the vote of the statement of no-confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies approved without any problem this law which, although influential, is usually neglected.
This is a paradox.
We like it or not, each chapter and every article represent the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is constituent part of the policy, albeit hidden behind the competition for power between government and opposition.
It is thus more attractive and that is why we give more attention in the media.
The wrangling politicians interested much more l´opinion than the figures rash.
The national budgets past socialist governments had suffered three evils that the current budget is not fit to address both:
The first is the important part attached to the costs of mandates imposed by law, not only by the pensions, but also by the social charges, adopted last year by the "coalition" grouping the silent?SSD and KS?M parties.
The second is a debt-ridden economy following the first badly.
The third obstacle is the lack of public finances, i.e. by the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, this is not the state budget deficit which is the biggest hazard.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often broadcast, in étourdis, obligations, endettant disproportionately their municipalities, to achieve, save money from taxes, rights and tax credits, new sources of investment.
In the past, they managed to pay off these debts by selling shares in mass distribution systems, including energy, obtained the state in the framework of privatisation.
Today, they have more of this souce.
According to official and verifiable facts,:
Our economy is experiencing already for several years, and the world, a phase of growth and?SSD is not to Venter.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regularise the public finances.
But instead, they endettaient the state.
Other countries, with a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable that our republic.
It is a shame monstrous which falls mainly on previous governments.
We are part of the country, the global scale, are less threatened by poverty.
So we do not need massive social programs that have, in recent years, unfortunately unnecessarily enflés.
Although we managed to remove part of populist spending absurd, approved last year before the elections if a discrepancy age limits for retirement, and a pension reform will not happen soon, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and those in power, it will administer.
In éxagérant, we can say that politicians in power will become méchaniquement bureaucrats majority distributing money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism costs are ordinary rejected by the costs of mandates.
The deficit of 70 billion planned for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not dispelled all the money they could.
If we really do not want that sometimes politicians in power into bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile coalition government, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what happens to collect in taxes and tax laws, calm needed to prepare new reform laws.
There is that these will gradually a balanced state budget.

The banks want to settle the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of America, the European Central Bank and the central banks English, Swiss and Canadian decided to jointly combat the crisis of financial markets.
More than 100 billion dollars will be placed on the money markets by the intermédiare auctions.
It comes to banks to sell, by auctions, the interest rate at which they are prepared to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send auctions 40 billion dollars and he will provide 24 billion to European central banks and the Swiss.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of individual states have decided to action at this point, concerted efforts to prevent or reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the lack of free capital that banks could pay", written in his report to clients Bernard Baumohl of society's outlook Economic Management Group.
"The concerted action of Central Banks has decreased the likelihood of a recession in the United States of 65 % to around 50 percent," Baumohl added in its report.
The banks have already lost 60 billion dollars in loans not reimbursed, particularly in the United States.
Analysts expect further losses billion.
"If the central banks have chosen this approach is that they should really understand what more can ensue," said the chief economist of ABN AMRO the Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he adds.
The central banks fear that if the banks themselves will have a difficult access to loans, they will pay more for their clients.
This would reduce consumption and would plunge the US economy into recession that could affect the economic growth of the world.
The central banks have chosen after failed to lower the London interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
Which meant that banks still feared mutual loans, despite that the US central banks, and Canadian English have declined several times during the autumn, interest rates.
"This will have the same effect that a further cut in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio agency Reuters society Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the approach of central banks not contribute to avert the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem is the fall of the US housing market.
President Klaus: the debates ecologists are incredible
Global climate changes are meant to harm especially for developing countries.
President Vaclav Klaus has again called on the problem of global warming.
The criticism has struck this time on the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali magnanimity.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not green, he stated that the debates ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus is not only the structure of the conference, formed by a curious mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the accompanying rhetoric and reality.
"The debate is not structured, is that a rocket words, ersatz solutions to the current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech president, said at the presentation of his book, that it has great importance and that is why it is committed to this cause.
He also expressed its satisfaction that his book also appear in German translation, because, he said, "I do often meeting that the caricature of my views."
Now, those interested can read its positions without being distorted.
Klaus reiterated that while it is not a weatherman, however, it has, in his opinion, enough provisions to write such a book.
This is indeed a Academician able to follow and assess the Treaties scientists, he practice of statistics and it is also an economist.
The major conclusions of the book are, according to him, the arguments: the climate is constantly evolving, changes to it are normal, so there is not a view shared by all researchers on global warming, the effects of the current changes are neither too big or too serious, they represent no danger and, finally, efforts to influence climate changes are unnecessary, and inefficient unacceptably expensive.
Especially as having the experience of a totalitarian regime, it considers unacceptable to impose views invérifiées to others what it feels like a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to questions of those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against a fundamentalist environmentalism which ignores the relationship between the costs and profits they make."
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this two months Hayek Institute.

According to former information, was likely a fine even someone who will not move.
In doing so it could be forced to pay up to 30,000 kronor.

It is enough to make or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.

"To be able to make a judgment on the contreproposition, we need the expert report that the other side has commissioned the drafting."
We will check if he has some explanatory value.
But we continue to believe that the total should not exceed hundreds of thousands, "stressed Dostál."
The amount should, according to him, be set between 100,000 and 200,000 K? for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family of Jablo?ov called a million kroner for each month where it could not raise his daughter organic.
Veleba has served the expert report, written for him by the Center to Prague-Motol University Hospital, as a document in support for negotiations of compensation.

Polívka lost Vala?ské Království (the Kingdom of Vala?sko)
Bolek Polívka has lost the dispute about the trademark Vala?ské království (Kingdom of Vala?sko).
According to the judge of the regional court in Ostrava, it is he who had first used the title of Vala?sko King, but the project was set up by the team around Tomá? Harabi?, a former member of the player.
Polívka was not present at the hearing today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabi? and his team parasitent on the popularity of Bolek," Polívka said after the trial lawyers of Polívka.
According to him, the Kingdom of Vala?sko words evoke everyone precisely this actor and comical.
Harabi? agrees.
"There is a work of almost ten years."
Research money and development of events, "he said."
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they have realized that the project was successful and they could benefit."
It is they who want parasiter on our work, "he added."
A lucrative business
According to the court, it is Polívka who first used the title vala?ský král of Vala?sko (King) in his television programme.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohatý was crowned king in 1993.
Yet, at the time, it had no connection with the project to establish a shadow kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi? came with the idea of seem Passport Království of Vala?ské.
A humorous action originally ultimately an business and a lucrative commercial activity, followed by, by Harabi?, society Vala?ské království.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that its name and signature are cited in the passport and it has even proposed to holders of balances on the price of the visit of its firm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge has also mentioned that Harabi? has merely used the idea naked, published by Polívka in the emission mané?, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of certainemement Boleslav Polívka has helped the Vala?ské království project," said the judge.
It added however that the soul of the project was formed by Harabi? and his team engaged in intensive project.
Cooperation between the parties today enemies continue until 2000 when Harabi? held Polívka to a Vsetín official coronation.
But after that, conflict began to accumulate Harabi? between Polívka, has culminated with the evidence "of King Boleslav 1 elected forever."
The leading role in the kingdom was then, inspired by Harabi?, played by the Jarmila?uláková cabaret singer as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka has filed a complaint against Harabi? and his company, request that the court has now rejected.
What could clarify the matter is tennis envisaged for the throne and a half of the princess.
He should get a new king.
He did not want to betray the details and date.
"We do not want to go fast."
It would be seen as the parade of kings to Slovácko.
King would be elected for some time.
Mr. Polívka even can clearly fit, "added Harabi?."
Test of the Peugeot 207 VTi SW 1.6 diparition prejudices:
Indeed, I have never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rotation qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of change speeds, and also the could manufacture, a below average.
Now, currently there are on the market his successor the Peugeot 207, which is much better.
Especially since the Combi appointed SW still goes a step further, it remains for me to reflect.
When I testais the classic hatchback Peugeot 207 I plaignais for example of space for the lead on the back seats.
While there over the complaints because the bodywork Combi means that even the large creatures, will be here at home.
Will see soon
I shall refer very quickly within and without repeating too much.
It is a design nearly succeeded, my only comment on the central tunel seems poor.
There, I would have liked to design a little more inventive, since the car has the air if elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when we could complain of seats or dossiers too short is over.
The latéral steering is also much improved compared to 206 model.
About space, increasing the size of the bodywork is too sensitive.
The Combi disappear also sees the lack of space above the head already mentioned.
A boot in the boot
The most important on this vehicle, so his soutte to luggage.
I must assess it as easily accessible (also thanks to the ice pivotante back) and an easy walk instead.
Blind spaces are equipped with elastic Warrant which are ideal.
It is not burdensome and can be extended while being able to keep objects asez vehicles.
But let us in volume.
This fact, according to the tables, 428 L in shaping basis, which is competition rather way.
Except the Skoda Fabia Combi, vehicle sold most of this category in the Czech Republic.
Comparing the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav, the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being of 52 litres.
When it comes to go on holidays abroad or to load a buggy, this figure is almost criticism.
But, if I had to highlight the benefits, I would mention the remaining below till after the overthrow of files back seats perfectly right, or a foot pedal - very low.
120 horsepower spread across four its cylinders
The car that we have tested fitted with an engine Otto four its cylinders with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 KW.
And indeed, this is what should look like a 1.6 which stimulates a hatchback family.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, he drives well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Skoda, which often gives the impression of having a pot of exhaust closed by a serpillère, then I cannot be that enthusiastic.
The tariffs drive
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, we must be aware that it has tested a car quite well equipped, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The price of a vehicle with a 1.4 litre engine Otto amounting to 329 900 K? still is satisfactory.
The vehicle that we have tested costs from 410 900 K?, which is already enough.
The equipment Premium, also tested, increases the price of 80 000 K?.
We have prepared and more bags head, an automatic air conditioning, essuis - Automatic Ice, an automatic command of rear windows...
In reality, the vehicle is ultimately 900 K? 531.
This is great, but try to add to the price of the Fabia extra equipment and you will get a very similar figure.
So it is to choose the brand.

For visitors, it really is an island of freedom.
Everything you expect your holidays can be achieved if you made a good choice.
Gold-trimmed beaches and white as snow, high waves or even a calm seas as a pond.
The palmes and the All inclusive servers with you on the beach with a pizza, ice or enivrants cocktails.
The kitesurfing, and the golf roulette.
Islands in the Sea of Caraîbes, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of Grandes Antilles.
At the time of Spaniards, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus described it as the best place as the human eye has never seen.
Havana has become the deposit and the treasures transshipment that Spaniards had stolen and they shipped in Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was erected in the early 20' years.
This is Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American Mafia, which has been building since everything a crime in the US (especially under Prohibition) was accepted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Parmis its customers, there were,,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, buildings up and drove cars belonging to the symbols of 50' cults years of last century, circulated on the broad avenues.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and Cojímar, he had his yacht.
The showbusiness of stars and politicians of America had complete their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
Now and then?
You can leave yourself your his autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you mixera the cocktail of your choice.
And these cars are always cults in Havana, as the jigoulis and the Fiats previously imported have long ago, in a climate if salé wet, and rotten.
Although Havana, especially the most old, decrepit is significantly, nullepart elsewhere around there so many beautiful colonial monuments there are precisely there.
Other places become finest example Trinidad.
Since tourism provides the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
During the last 15 years, new hotels led not only to Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holguín province, and also on the small islands such as Cayo Coco Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still proposes a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be appreciated by amateurs small trains.
The cane was returned since the plantations in extensive sweets on a road close by small steam trains and engine.
Their equipment has not been renewed for decades and it is what is propelling small locomotives contemporary which are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to direct its not?
The majority of visitors are the places.
So there is no need to write about Varadero or of course Havana.
Otherwise recall that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, a museum and that anyone who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Vi?ales valley west of the island is one of the most fanciful corner of Cuba.
A exhubérante bushes grow there on ground limestone.
The mogotes calcaires, balloons and rocks of candle right in the bottom of the valley, and fertile land is being taken in their sandpits, even his junk rock are covered a very dense vegetable carpet.
The Valley is where characterises Cuban tobacco probably the best quality.
You can meet the final shape of this product if you visit one of cigar factories in Havana.
Someone may also interesting that is that was turned the Chilean episode of Major saw.
Trinidad
Ancient city founded shortly after that the Spanish have colonised the island.
It is the market slave trade and the sugar that brought him fame and wealth.
The wealth is embodied in the beauty and the ville-vitrine nature of this small town.
Koloniální?pan?lská architektura výrazn? ovlivn?ná pozd?j?ími, francouzskými osadníky, za?ty?i staletí tém?? nezm?nila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountainous Escambray massive, is a place to point out that even in the years 50' of the last century, there was no way to run from this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation has enabled him to stand.
There was nothing, and this is why démolissait nothing, everyone was content to have a roof over their heads.
If it has, Trinidad, more time that afternoon, then it is worthwhile to go see also interessants places around like the Playa Ancón beach or the Valley of Sucreries.
Then, the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa of the Música who drives after the bed of the sun and where the music is assourdit that the morning.
Baracoa
Some call this village located in the extreme east of Cuba as the most beautiful island.
This view is certainly influenced already by the road that leads to it.
The two roads that lead since Guantanamo must cross high mountains and accidentées across a landscape and almost without brands of human activity.
UNESCO has included the rock east of Cuba, thanks to its countryside intact, on the list of world heritage.
It produces the best chocolate to church, the cross of Christopher Columbus (in reality, it has been nearly a hundred years after the tour) and Columbus since the hill where the old castle is strong, and current hotel El Castillo, several mountains table, whose most famous is El Yunque.
Over coffee, rum, cigars, mountainous Sierra Maestra massive Bay, sows and the island of Isla Pinos Saloon, the Tropicana, the sanctity of the holy Patrone of Caridad del Cobre Cuba, the Santeria, African religions practised by the descendants of former slaves, about all that we could fill a quantity of pages.
Just as we said, it is better to see again.

For example, Germany has been criticised for his passivity.
"The Germans have in Afghanistan a relatively large representation."
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, the requirements of battle they are subjects are therefore not as rigorous as those in the south and east of the country where we operate, "said Gates."
The tabloid Sun britanique has described this week the German soldiers of lazy.

But I do not expect this change, "he said."

She likened today before a court in Khartoum for having appointed a toy bears in
The British teacher judged in Sudan to insult to Islam was sentenced Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and deportation, his lawyer said.
The Briton was accused of having left pupils of 6 to 7 years given the name Mohammed to a bear in toy while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
It was punishable by a sentence of lashes.
This British teacher 54 years according to the Unity High School in Khartoum in Sudan, was arrested Sunday at home and convicted of assault on Islam and sedition, under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, following several complaints from parents of pupils with the Education Ministry of Sudan.
The story goes back in September when this teacher asks its pupils, aged 6/7 years to choose a name for the toy bears in class.
"Eight names out of the mouths of children, Hassan and Mohammed Abdullah," tells the school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 children on 23 have chooses Mohamed as preferred surname.
Mohamed is the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children were then produced a book for the class with a photo of the bear followed the legend 'my name is Mohamed.'
The bear itself was no label with the name, but the problem is simply that the representation of the Prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One fellow Muslims Gillian Gibbons teacher in the same school in Sudan, said that he knew well and she would never have done anything that would be an insult to religious faith, "I just regret that it has asked the children to vote for a name", according to him as an " innocent mistake. "
View shared by many pupils of the teacher who the describe as "very thoughtful towards its pupils" and " who never mentions religion in class. "
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the most second name given in Britain, it is written in English of 14 different ways.
This name often chooses by Muslim families is a way to honour the prophet (often gave the first child a family).
But what are the rules on the use of this name?
For example, can give a toy?
Of course this is a matter of interpretation.

Repairs on the spectacular space station
It took more than seven hours in space to the astronaut Scott Parazynski and his fellow crew of the International Space Station (ISS) for the spectacular repair a torn solar panel, indispensable to the pursuit of scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit has accumulated records of its duration, its remoteness habitable modules, the speed with which it was conceived, "tools" cobbled together by the astronauts to make repairs.
The problem arose Tuesday while the astronauts had cleared the Discovery shuttle the Harmony module, a big piece of cylindrique admission scientific laboratories European and Japanese (see flanked).
This is a module quay of appontage for the modules-laboratoires.
But it must be the electricity supply in.
The second task of the crew was to move one module of electricity from solar panels weighing 17.5 tonnes, already on the ISS, to put it to post on its final position.
Having moved, the crew began the redeployment of solar panels module that have a large-scale 76 metres.
And this is one of the signs, déplient as accordéons, has been damaged in almost a metre by a cable that has stuck.
The deployment was blocked for not more damage the trap.
The astronauts, who were originally exit a control of the shuttle Discovery, then go repair another solar panel whose rotating system was flawed, were forced to dedicate to sign damaged.
And it is Scott Parazynski was selected to go after caracoler 30 metres of the télécommandé arm of the shuttle added to that of the station for repair.
This is one of the best "spacewalker" (marcheur) area of NASA.
Great, resistant, appropriate, it has the torse highly developed and long arm.
To 46 years, this doctor training has therefore been instructed to "operate" the solar panel " wounded ".
After precisely inspected the damage, he sectionné cable wrong and installed some sort of "attelles" on the damaged area.
He was helped by another "spacewalker" remained near the halfway house and, within, by other astronaut Peggy Whitson, which the person of Commander of the crew.
The tool that he used, a minicanne of hockey wrapped up of isolating to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was conceived and "cobbled together" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation is over, Scott Parazynski waited until the sign is fully deployed before the inventory of its tools and regain the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of half a day of rest before today, only seven astronauts return the shuttle Discovery for a return to Earth scheduled Wednesday.
The title EADS stock market punished
The action EADS is in sharp decline currently on the Paris stock market, after the group of aerospace and defence has announced it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the delays to the A400M.

The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense, Sunday, exit polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming their desire for stability, or even to authoritarianism, after a campaign very frozen.
Three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends a message to voters televised on public channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
It is as list of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the President has nothing to show receiving the foreign ambassadors, preferring to deliver a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favourite topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of a real democracy and want honest elections, transparent and open elections smoothly," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, is far from this.
It denounces a campaign marred pressure.
The Communist leader Guennadi Zyuganov said that there was " never too dirty elections, even at the time of Boris Yeltsin.
After the repression of demonstrations last weekend, the former world champion Garry Kasparov chess, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, remains forbidden to visit according to his lawyer.
" The Russians have kept the mentality of Homo sovieticus '
Behind these thrillers legislative without appearing two issues much more open:
- Who will succeed Putin to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential 2 March 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot seek a third consecutive term.
Yet no successor has emerged.
- What role will play Putin after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the almighty United Russia party which may choose the government and the President?
Nevertheless, the legislation as presidential power, the outgoing will prevail.
It is a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of Homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny," believes the Lev Goudkov sociologist, director of the independent Levada centre.
Kopossov historian Nikolaï University of state of St. Petersburg, goes back further: civil society has been delayed in this country christianisé five centuries after Europe; the famous Community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin has rediscovered the model of a paternalistic state, fully accepted by the population because this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by fluency economic" Maria Lipman, believes, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "voluntarily waive personal responsibility" that they had briefly shown after the collapse of the USSR.
"What good thinking?"
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite wants to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (on 85 Heads of Russian regions) lead the local lists of Russia united.
The new freedoms imported to West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefer stability.
Why the Russians do not vote for extremists.
Tamara Tcherednitchenko conclusion, professor of 54 years, " what good thinking?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why the change? "

Sensitive information
Historians access to Bad Arolsen will conduct research " on the movement of prisoners, the population camps and the health of workers forced ', explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, opposed the opening to the public in those roll-call documents, because of the sensitivity of certain information.
As homosexuality supposed mental disability or some victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been gathered after war in a practical purpose: regain civilians deported or subject to mandatory work and possibly provide proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Yet today to Bad Arolsen, over 300 permanent employees treat tens of thousands of individual requests.
Yet, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect these documents," it said in 2006 Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Research on Anti-Semitism Technische Universität in Berlin.

Bono accepts to lead the candidacy of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo and chairing the Congress if they win the elections
The former Minister of Defense Jose Bono has accepted the offer of the government and the Secretary-General of the Socialists, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to be at the top of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general election and be President of Congress if the Socialists win the general elections.
And the Secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, Jose Blanco, and Bono him even announced during a press conference after the meeting held at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive has justified the offer made to the former because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono " is among the best. "
It stressed that "yes it seems" man of La Mancha policy will be the candidate of the Socialist Group will preside over Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, which he has made public on 15 November its decision not to stand for prochainess general elections and to abandon his political career to devote themselves to the fight against climate change in the academic framework.
The former acknowledged that the government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political forefront since he has abandoned two years ago.
Moreover, he pointed out that even if people already know who will be Vice Economic if the Spanish Socialist party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will chair the Congress, in an "act of transparency."
If it reached the post, Bono hope transform the House "a House of respect and not insult or cry" and that " it looks more and more people. "
"Sometimes it seems miserably single that local Madrid where we cannot talk quietly and calmly is Congress, chairman of the Senate Government in certain occasions was interrupted 26 times."
Similarly, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and his "turn" and he did not act as if it had already office not to fall, as he said, in what his opponents might regard as " a domination. "
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change makes a miséricorde persecution without both skeptics its predictions that those who gives priority to other social and political battles, it must demonstrate a consistency of iron.
This is especially the case for a leader of the movement who is chairman of the government as Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than the Islamic terrorism and proposes even sign a new contract "for the planet."
This approach requires it to explain why the action, or inaction, his government contributed decisively that Spain is at the head of the European Union in the non-éxecution of Kyoto protocols.
Who is responsible for the non-éxecution, in which sectors has it happened and why his government, the contract with the planet has not avoided.
It should be clear to the Spaniards what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens must be changed, what energy savings individual and collective will we have to do, what economic consequences this will happen.
That is, who will surrender and who will pay to save the planet.
But there was and there will be no explanations.
Precisely because it is sacrifice and pay.
The measures against climate change, the actual measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Until the hundredth of petrol suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed electoralmente him so dangerous to Zapatero he wasted no time to deny it.
That is to save the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with slogans devoid of real consequence.
With phrases that have impact committees, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, the gentleman if useful for the campaigns which does not speak, which does not condemn and which does not require, embellit rallies and inspires the tenderness.
Provided that this is just be a virtual purely party and claims to what we say in bicycle or we rafraîchissions with the range.

What I insurance?
Car insurance, which covers the driver contingency sinister, involves a major spending will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of licences, marital status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the use, among others.
Having a car that is the main.
There are escoger, automóvil el Seguro of adecuado incluso más difícil ES elegir El Modelo that vehículo of.
And that is that, choose appropriate car insurance, is even more difficult to choose the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise materializes by insurance, which states that the company receives the value of the premium paid and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation claim.
The premium is the price of insurance, which establishes itself taking into account various factors such as age, sex, age of licences, marital status, the type of vehicle to ensure or usageque and others.
Insurance companies establish their prices according statistics, so that more likely to suffer an accident is high, more popular to pay is high.
That is why people over 25 years and women must pay premiums, lower as statistics show that these persones have a sinister rate lower their caution.
Similarly, using censuses, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents that lone drivers.
The use made of the vehicle affect the frequency, and therefore on the likelihood of having an accident.
By increasing the frequency the odds are increasing.
There are many variables that insurers take into account in setting the price of the premium.
For this, that the driver must study the situation to choose motor insurance that is better in his profile.
We shall here the most significant variables to selecting one or another type of insurance, which, in addition to adapting the characteristics of the insurer, offer a reasonable price.
The age of 25 face various drawbacks in delivering a contract with an insurance at an accessible price, as can be the low experience in the conduct and seniority of licences.
Although the ideal to be well secured an assurance to any risk, other options most economic exist.
The drivers more far-sighted can opt for an insurance risk with frankness, so that they get blankets of insurance to all risk but at prices more accessible.
This form of convention implies that the customer pays a portion of the amount of sinister.
"The part of the amount of sinister that the customer pays will be established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher than the amount will be low," says Luis Noguera, the Spain of First Europa insurance Ombudsman on-line.
Another option is to insurance third expanded to what the customer provides protection to cope with the damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
It would be covered against theft, fires and the loss of the vehicle.
A board.
If you are minor 25 years essaies be careful and avoid accidents, where possible, because it has implications for the subsidy, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A reduction of the basic price that owns the company.
Instead, a sanction is extending the basic price.
"The subsidies and sanctions will depend on the company and profit."
If the company has had a good year she can afford to increase the subsidies, "clarifies Noguera."
Beyond the 25 years it becomes easier for drivers in delivering a contract with an insurance, since the rate of accidents is reduced by the accumulated experience.
That is why it is better to choose an insurance risk with frankness.
"Normally young people cannot take the prior experience gained after an accident," the director of the European airline in Spain and adds that most accidents occur during the second year of conduct, once past the " fear of novice. "
However, if the customer is married but has not yet children it is better that he negotiates an assurance to any risk, the momento that its economic situation allows it.
Marriages with children are regarded by insurers as people with the lowest claims, because the increases will be weaker.
In this case the best insurance would be an assurance to any risk with franchise (which can be 300 euros), or a third assurance enlarged from the third year of life of the vehicle when the policyholder has a high level of subsidy.
"They conduct a more relaxed and they have a greater purchasing power to have the luxury to assume a greater proportion of exemptions," Judge Luis Noguera.
For pensioners insurance to all risk with frankness is preferable because it (150 euros), or asurance third in an enlarged when the insurer has a high level of subsidy.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver facing possible claims, but also because it represents an important expenditure, that is why it is crucial to properly study the assurance that we need more in our personal situation.
Celtic will seek to earn a point to Milan to reach the huitièmes final of
The AC Milan and Glasgow Celtic measure next Tuesday at San Siro to research the point that their lack for achieving their respective objectives in the closure of the Champions League, since it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to classify.
The Italians account for ten points and they have already qualified for the fifth day thanks to a Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to ensure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, which has six, and who gets Benfica has four, do not go to him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth day ends, since the AC Milan must semifinales for the World Cup of Clubs Japan 13 this month in search of a place in the final of the 16 December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the match no one stage Giuseppe Meazza seems to be the most awaited, although the two teams will try out successful, because the Italians will not speculate home and Celtic Glasgow winner knows that it would remain first and ensure a better intersection in the huitièmes of final.
A defeat of the team of Gordon Strachan could be enough to place if the Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but it cannot computer only on this since with nine points games is up to the Ukrainian, who lost last week in Glasgow (2 - 1) but have won (2 - 0) in another direct duel.
Thus, in Milan will try to poison the evening the Scot, who have hopeful place for the huitièmes final for the second time in the Champions League, having been beaten during the last edition by a goal from Kaka during the extensions (1 - 0).
Meanwhile the victory of rossoneri' " triumph would only in Shakhtar, where Celtic would lose, in place for the huitièmes final in order to continue the Champions League by UEFA.
And that is that the Benfica, although it is final and without opportunities to pursue European competition, could reach third place with a victory.

The new case gas between Russia and Ukraine lays the alarm.
A dispute over gas prices ferments between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of impact on oil exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (U. convoyées E) are by pipelines, and each led is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, she will increase taxes transit to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two, had caused a drop in supplies to countries of the EU
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom monopoly company property of Russia supplying gas, tried in vain to find agreement on the cost of the Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase as expected, its price to Ukraine as it has agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50 % more for gas supplies from Turkmenistan neighbour.
Analysts have said that this would pose for Ukraine, a 40 % increase the cost of imports from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, noting that we are a country through which passes most gas," announced the Ukrainian Minister of Economic Affairs Anatoly Kinkh to the Reuters news agency.
"The fluctuations of gas costs would undoubtedly linked to our discussions about taxes transit (to Western Europe via Ukraine)"
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006, the interruption of Gazprom supplies to Ukraine.
This led to the fall in exports to Western Europe, therefore increasing prices.
The Russian gas represents a quarter of supplies to the European Union.
Russia has the largest stocks of gas, although most of them are still under developed.
Consequently, Gazprom completes its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.

The Al-Qaeda sympathizers have directed a campaign against the monarchy ally the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell composed of eight militants, led by a resident alien planifiait attack against an oil plant in the Eastern Province, said the newspaper TV.
Saudi Arabia has quickly formed a group of 35 military to protect sites, following a failed attack in 2006, against the largest site at Abqaiq oil.
The newspaper quoting a statement from the Interior Minister, said that 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by an "expert" launch missiles which has invaded the country.

The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists have yesterday said that Venus was certainly a planet pleasant to live.
The data from the European spacecraft in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly two times smaller than the Earth, contrary to what we thought before.
Venus is the closest planet Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years, Venus could have been conditions similar to those of the Earth, and could even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, dûe atmospheric erosion to Allied solar radiation to rotate slower led Venus towards a different kind of development.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and storms of lightning and has a surface temperature of hot enough to melt lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the sonde of the European Space Agency, who has studied the planet for one year, offers a bleak vision of the future potential of the Earth due to the catastrophic climate change.
Professor of Physics Department of Oxford University, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the mission of the Venus Express, said: " We are starting to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of the Earth, although planets as they even are almost similar.
"Our new data we establish a scenario in which there are billions of years, Venus was originally similar to Earth could be even with a habitable surface."

Yet open to all
Mitt Romney said not match as candidate for the presidency, to answer questions of a slip of snow.
Despite this, the Republican candidate for the presidency have finally agreed to participate in You Tube, during which many ordinary voters who registered their questions, submit to candidates.
Wednesday evening 28 November, any of the questions has been so ridiculous that the outcome of another debate of You Tube, when a slip of Snow asked Democrats with their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers have much reflected the conditions, Republican Party's candidate for the next elections.
It is not clear what criteria, producers of CNN, which has the debate, Russia's chose the result of You Tube to show the candidates candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest addressing a single subject, was focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the strong points for Republicans.
CNN has asked some voters to telephone when they agree, pleasant things: the governed noted increases of approval when candidates are so crude.
The exchange the harder and longer of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, National Front leader and Mr. Romney who heads of important elections of the Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that it was compliant about illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, employ illegal immigrants home.
The two fighters fiercely particularly when they are asked if they would be prepared to promote a "amnésia" (giving illegal immigrants a regular status and the opportunity to become a citizen). "
Minor candidates Duncan Hunter as Canseco, a Californian and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado the Canseco, managed to deepen this.
Neither has the ability to be elected, but both remain in the race, can be thanks to the fact that they have begun to combat before immigration and more effective than others.
Generally, the candidates, at least on immigration, have the same opinion: the borders more rigid, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This, ally of concerns raised by the case of toxic toys made in China, or other fears about the external world, promotes the Republicans to forget, or minimise divisions between conservatives and libertarians Catholics.
But the debate has become particularly embarrassing when other issues have been raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the campaign for the control of weapons.
John McCain and Mr. Romney have debated whether to put water in the nose should be regarded as a torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates believed in its entirety, the content of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to say that the Bible is his favorite book, although it is not about to believe in the history of Jonas and whales.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus was in favour of the death penalty.
We do not expect to see Mike Huckabee, - in pole position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to his Christian conservatism - say that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When pressed about whether Jesus would have been in favour, it started to laugh and said that Jesus is too smart to stand for election.
The human race remains insolitement open at all.
The resurgence of Mr. Huckabee in Iowa coincides with the recent enormous subsidies research conducted by the libertarian Ron Paul, and the sifflements during the debate Wednesday.
There are two émergés of nothingness, thanks to the fact that the two protected the party are unable to agree to decide who is the candidate more experienced and more traditionaliste.
In 1980 and 2000, a unifia candidate the party early and convincingly with a message of success on the American greatness bringing leaders.
This time, the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
The pains of Labor
Gordon Brown has discovered a new hole in which descend; Even if it démissionnait, the situation will not change.
Given the tendency of British scandals, it is not particularly lucrative.
No decorations sold or Parisian hotel bills of politicians, no finger of marital sucé foot outside.
But a revelation confirms that a rich man of case would have masked for four years under false names, its contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650 ($1, 000.) (3m), that the party would not have declared: a new battle which Gordon Brown would be well spent.
Two months ago, the prime minister has backtracked in its draft election, insulting British intelligence stupidly proclaiming that opinion polls have not influenced his decision, and that he hoped the opposite, offer a compact and efficient government.
Instead, like Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said the terrifying Mr. Brown has turned to Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The takeover of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty in the fall, has shown a loophole directives and poor judgment in emergencies.
Inadequate proposals for change in the tax code led a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from authorities taxes, revealed an incredible administrative cock-up.
A trio of retired generals have launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting the cuts in military spending: proclaiming that be Defence Minister is for them, part-time jobs.
Currently, the suspected purpose donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of the (Labor and its former head of the vigilance) have done they had to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is bound to the door.
However governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People do not like politicians, and have confidence in them, but generally leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems clear that a prime minister can improve things, or even govern for long at risk the suspension: public administration no longer works; the cabinet ministers are stock research; the bad press stories; and the government is on the defensive and without any objective.
In a sense, the position of Mr. Brown is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a beginning.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, it was his lieutenant higher.
The problems surrounding the Northern Rock and data taxes for example, are linked to decisions by Mr. Brown taken when it was Chancellor of the UK Treasury.
And even if it is not directly involved in the misfortunes of Blair, as the long investigation into the funds of the Party "cash for members of the House of Lords," voters may think otherwise.
But the difficult situation that Mr. Brown faces is not so tragic that it has the air.
The blunders are not so monstrous as party members of the Tories believe.
As Mr. Bean, there is no victim or scam.
And the cure, although painful, could be to implement the Stalinist trends of Mr. Brown of always in favour of a reliable government and slightly brutal.
The new scandal on political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very particular character, who compares its donations to charity, said that he wanted no public recognition of his charity.
He can have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of big subventionneurs politicians are clear, and they exist for good reason: the public has a right to know that contributes to the success of those who govern the country.
Mr. Watt, be aware of Mr. Abrahams, without knowing it was illegal, must therefore be questioned, as Jon Mendlesohn, the collections of subsidies which had spoken of questionable donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: nothing suggests that it was aware of these steps, even if most of the payments were made following his arrival in government in June.
So far the prime minister made half.
He quickly condemned the legislative gap of his party, but it has not drawn attention to the fact that the power of decision is based on a stunt that he knows well, make use of a committee of inquiry on the subject of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to learn are not complicated.
And if the law has been flouted, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent President of the Independent Committee of Standards of public life, without leader for six months, and prepare a good reform on the funding of political parties.
That would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to work with the Tories, which could lead it to abandon its financial report particular confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a fan that Mr. Brown.
But it should face facts supporters.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the elections; he has two years to recover the voters, and the only way to achieve a victory is to demonstrate an impeccable integrity and competence.
Card fraud.
The crisis mortgages contaminerait the American market credit cards?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see the fins, tourbillonner artificially induced around.
Now that the housing market is in a phase US criticism, predators are aimed at US market credit cards.
Analysts from Goldman Sachs think losses to credit cards could achieve · 99 billion if the infection extends mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are rate increases in the costs and insolvency, which measure the shares of assessment not recoverable or who are over 30 days after.
HSBC announced last month that it took 1.4 billion · in its consumer credit, partly because of the weakness of the bearers.
It is too early to panic.
The costs and the insolvabilités are still moderates.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the rate of the insolvency of 3,89 % troixième quarter is less than almost one point compared to its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly be explained by technical factors.
A change of laws in 2005 in the United States, on the personal bankruptcy has caused an abrupt fall archives of bankruptcy, which in turn has caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and therefore insolvency) rates could increase even if conditions should worsen loans.
The announcement also payment rates fixed, which highlight the monthly debt that consumers must resolve.
And confidence in the safety of capital credit cards is quite strong despite the paralysis other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the emission volume for 2007 will be 25 percent higher than last year.
The direct links of infection between the crisis mortgages and the market credit cards certainly exist: consumers may prefer to increase their debts now that the fair mortgages have disappeared.
But card issuers are more attention to the flow of cash rather than the value of heritage and falling housing prices has not necessarily been a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits issuers of credit.
Premiums for consumers in the payment mortgages fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; consequently, debt by credit card would become a priority to repay the amounts up everything.
Card issuers are able to respond more quickly than the mortgages and with more flexibility in such conditions of crisis, because they can change interest rates or alter the limits of rédit.
This should in theory reduce the risk of having an early resumption of actions.
"We are not going we wake up one morning and reassess all loans." said Gary Perlin, the director of Capital One.
If a financial disaster market credit cards is unlikely, there are high risks of having a consistent decline.
If prices lower housing and a contraction in the credit market lead America into recession, industry should face a grim future.
Made much attention back to the fins..
British bankers pleads guilty to Enron.
The three British bankers who must go testify their roles in a fraud committed by the previous financial director of Enron, Mr. Andrew Fastow, have changed their statement, pleading guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were declared innocent first seven charges for alleged fraud in 2000, collusoire committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to thrive in spite of their employees.
They should appear in court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. American, they were all found guilty of committing a fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of Group PLC of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous throughout Britain because of extradition procedures that lasted two years.
The United States, their case remains an open question for this inquiry launched following the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The accusations that were imposed in 2002, have made clear to Fastow that it was the subject of the investigation of the government in the Enron debacle.
The accusations against the bankers, so-called "three Natwest" say come to Houston in 2000, to organise a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich has invested in a subsidiary of a partner of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the orchestrator many fraudulent scenarios, which has helped àtruquer bankruptcy procedures.
In early 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as zero, but the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the subsidiary for 1 million pounds.
Bankers paid 250 to Kopper · as interest in this society.
According to the accused, Fastow would have mistakenly announced at Enron that society of energy was having to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for his shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the accusations, bankers might have reached $7. 3 while Fastow, Kopper and others have gained 12.3 million ·.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was stopped after three months.
Fastow has suffered imprisonment of six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper was imprisoned for three years and one month in prison in Texarkana.
The British three were released after payment of a deposit of · 1million each, which oblige them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, previously seventh largest national company, into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of trucages accountants, could not hide his billion of debt or even propose its phoney speculation as profitable.
The collapse has resulted in thousands of redundancies, more · 60 billion loss in market value and more · 2 billion loss for the pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former President General Jeffrey Skilling excused were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling excused was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes have failed because of his death due to a heart attack last year.
Neither in nor out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine autonomy and possessing sufficient fuel to fly without stopover in Moscow to Los Angeles, part of · 54 million.
But this is just a small change for some Russians.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if nobody réelement need as seats because it is more of a plane for family use or for the president of a society."
Mr. Firer was the stand of Gulfstream, last Friday at Millionnaires, part of an orgy of incentives for consumption during four days in an enormous exhibition centre around the capital.

Surgeon not liking suspected of homicide in New Jersey
It was the day after Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston was looking through the glass frontage Just restaurant has little Healthier and observed an ambulance had just stop at the doors of white fashionable Cape Cod vacation area on the Avenue West Scott.
Then came the police patrol.
And then another.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop" Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
This is where I have done that someone had died.
The authorities then apprendraient that the person killed was a woman aged 41 years, Olga Arroyo, assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine the cause of his death is dûe in a gesture executed by a cosmetic surgeon not approved, that the police has not yet identified, resident at 212 of the Avenue West Scott.
The authorities have not yet determined the cause of death of Miss Arroyo, but they are confident, the results of toxicological tests which unfortunately will take time, but that should solve this mysterious death has saddened the senior ranks of the police in Newark.
Miss Arroyo was the assistant director of the police, Garry F. McCarthy, super-bureaucracy since September 2006, and his voice was well-known in different departments.
It was fair, great worker and tenacious, "McCarthy said about Miss Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday."
"It was like a pit bull"
" It would have done everything to protect me '

Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will diminish the rates linked to the turmoil of the global stock.
The actions are explosive devices on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market had hoped that the Fed would have tried to defuse credit later, cutting interest rates promoted by apaisantes the vice chairman of the US central bank.
The booming stock markets in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No 2 after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide, must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the restive financial markets.
In an apparent effort to reassure the markets irritated seen these new tensions related to credit, Mr. Kohn said that the recent fallout has partly " reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market in late September and October.
If this harsh fallout persists, this would increase the likelihood of a further rigidity financial conditions for homeowners and businesses, has - T - he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Fed is prepared to inject new capital in US markets, and that further cuts in interest rates could stabilize the credit conditions.
These remarks have also helped assuage Wall Street with more bad news on the US economy, the biggest drop in property sales for October.
The repercussions of this financial turmoil was heightened following the declaration of Bear Stearns, investment bank, announcing that it licenciera 650 people, i.e., 4 % of its staff, to reduce the cost to compensate for the losses to dûes bets losers of home loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in London where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow industrial average of Jones has risen 331 points or 2,55 percent to 13.289,40 while the index, the S & P 500, took 2.65 %.
In London, the FTSE 100 index 100 took 165,5 points or 2.7 % to 6306,2 adding more 39£ to the value of British companies.
The German DAX index has risen 2.6 % CAC40 and the French took 2.3 %.
Previously, the re-emergence of difficulties in the credit markets has been highlighted following strong demand of an auction of funds from monthly sorting by the European Central Bank, which has cut these loans to commercial banks at European high rate of 4.7 percent, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and subsequent to inject funds in the financial markets in London, causing tension of credit, because borrowing rates monthly sorting "Libor" British banks, have caused their highest growth since last September, 6,59 % following a strong rebound since 12 November.
England faces an appeal to the judgment of the criticism of Owais Ravi Shah and Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult.
The batteur 6 for England at Kandyan this week ending, Owais or Bopara Ravi Shah?
And even more important in a context as large as the first Test against Sri Lanka, which will take the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, president of sélectionneurs who was exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to take its decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, President Director General of England starts to complete the forms of candidacy to become a national sélectionneur at least part time.
That will not win the dossard 6 will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport.
This is never easy to destroy what allows a man to reach the top of his profession while another will never happen besides the lower level, sometimes by luck as by lack of skill.
It was not only to cricket that the selection is difficult, because in the end, the verdict is subjective.
Is the right time to emerge Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, who choose between John Edwards or Banerjee? " ' tubby; both, new executives with good qualifications, professionals, should be promoted, but there is room for only one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketeur unless it receives at least a chance?
The figures are important in the decisions, but also the opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketeur must catch the eye of the captain, at the same time it must take the door and a batteur must be lucky to reach the cricketeur of a day.
But catching the eye of sélecteurs is more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, although Stephen Harmison is claimed in full form and continued to lead to serve.
Anderson took 32 Gates in first class on 33 rounds to earn a place.
Chris Tremlett has taken that 29 to the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and still offer hope.
If it will or Bopara Shah who will play on stage Asgiriya, this is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build the career of a man, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty has played in every Test and has been successful in the first, with five doors and 40 rounds useful, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also fought to emerge, who managed to become the cricketeur of the Test, and that, despite the fact that marked his double hundred against Australia in Australia can still be found.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at the Asgiriya stage, will certainly their conservative instincts and favour the greatest experience of Shah against the exuberance of the young Bopara.
The two have good arguments.
For Shah, his brilliant and considerable Innings beginning in the Test of 88 in Bombay, 32 cents in first class against six for Bopara to 22ans, who is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah has ten rounds during his two Innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test Lord, its city of Middlesex player, and that the immediate rejection by the sélectionneurs when Vaughan again in form, réclama place for the next game, seems to have distressed its moose so obvious in Bombay.
Unlike him, the player of Essex is full of joy.
Nothing frightens him on a cricket ground and it has exaggerated when he recently scuppered on a 4x4 during a presentation of Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
It has postponed slight injuries, was shocked, even if the first thing he did was take his sponsor Vodafone (of course) and Alastair Cook called his équipier, which looked at the way to ask "s" he had seen that? "
Bopara is by far the best batteur filante its pace allows him to make services which will, and struggling with confidence and solvency.
Choose the right man is one thing, choose the right time is another.
What can be the true art of the selection?
I would be likely to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, like tea leaf suggest, who will play this week ending.
Buses bringing people to work, and to fight against Al Qaeda.
The first bus full of refugees from Syria happened in Baghdad yesterday, lavishing the exiles without money or without visa renewals, or others who hope that the city has regained normality.
Some have returned to fight against the militants who have away from home.
The bus station Mansour, even before the arrival of Damascus 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of buses of government official, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan are income by their means.
"I decided to visit Syria after they have killed several doctors to Baghdas" said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I returned today because I have seen on the TV and read in the newspapers this happened in Baghdâd and given that the city is safer now."
"They say that the Mahdi army is committing more crimes!" he said, referring to the militant Shia militia of ecclesiastical Moqtada al-Sadr, which has imposed its men moving away.
Al Atwani Qassim, a teacher of 38 years Shia area of Amariyah dominated by the Sunni, returned with his two children, because it could not renew his visa because the Syrian and Iraqi regime prevents work.
Its neighbours of Shia in Amariyah have called to say that the militia helped by the United States, has allowed to hunt Al-Qaeda in the west of the capital, and have invited to return.
A new entrants to Jordan is the leader of a Sunni tribe and Shia who had to leave his house north of Baghdâd because of a grenade attack after he urged people to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But it should return to combat.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me having established a militia anti- Al Qaeda to Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That is why I go today," said Sabaah Obeidi, Alu of 62.
Many say they have attracted by increasing the calm in the capital since US troops arrived, and the sight of training "groups of citizens involved" well armed and collaborating with the US military to defend their neighborhoods.
But others say have been forced to return due to the visa problem and decadence of the capital of Damascus, when over 3 million Iraqi have eschewed the past.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years, father of three children, expressed suspicion felt by all about visas for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki's government, Premier Shia, who would have asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have fled the country because of sectarian squads of death.
"We had no problem until al-Maliki's government comes in Syria and urges the government not to give visas to Iraqi, forcing them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I cannot trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left."
The reduction of violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis have been driven out areas of Shia and vice versa, creating where tensions are lower.
We fear that a sudden influx of refugees is rising again and sectarian tensions reminiscent of the fighting.
Small Saar, good training.
The smallest state conducts training professionelle, and shines even by the international orientation of its universities.
It is only in an area that a deficit on sarrois, similar to the rest of the country.
"I exliqué yesterday for the 50ème time in a non-sarrois, that we are not - French" is the slogan that the smallest federal state, by self-mockery, poster for his concedes.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of Saarland, system which is placed fifth in the training instructor Institute of German economy of Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, universities cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in 1948 to Saarbrücken by the French.
To date, the students have the chance to finish their studies by a double or a triple diploma.
Witness the quotitée high of 15.6 % of foreign students.
The Saar also leads it also children of countries until the colleges in number above the average - many of them without a degree of Gymnasium.
"In Saarland, we take the vocational training system," said Axel Plünnecke, expert in IW training.
More than one in five young gets its title at a vocational school and Saarland stands at more than seven points above the national average.
Also the possibilities of combination of an academic and vocational training are relatively well developed.
Given the number of inhabitants, the panel of dual curriculum is the second best of Germany.
Despite a practical training and growing demand, the number of diplomés engineering has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Education Ministry sarrois has forced the colleges to a marketing campaign in materials science of the engineer.
"After the first PISA studies we celebrated many reforms in schools General.", said a spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
The government has introduced throughout the federal state tests of comparison.
For that children are starting earlier to learn, the last year of crêche is free of law - a model that other federal states also copy.
Only future studies of comparison will show if the performance of pupils are improving in a sustainable way.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the quotité of pupils to risk was reduced from 29 to 20 percent.
However, the total Saarland has not improved as much as other federal states.
The Bavarian fare better.
And despite the sarrois, the foreign language knowledge are not measured by the PISA studies - we could otherwise gain points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbour is compulsory in high schools - even if the sarrois are not French.
Chávez rule watches the
In Venezuela, will soon be tic-tac watches differently than the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chavez will trace the machine a half-hour in the South American countries.
Chavez is becoming a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela the used, a new law, the watches will be dealt with at least four and a half time universal.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone which does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position by the fact that the US would have imposed the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
Moreover, Chávez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with neighbouring Colombia, a matter of hostages.
The left-wing nationalist announced that until the conservative Alvaro Uribe would remain president of Colombia, or to maintain relations with the head of state, nor with the Colombian government.
"I can already, just because of my dignity," said Chavez who rushed a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the country tanker will vote in a referendum Sunday.
With this reform, it would considerably strengthen its power in the country.
The issue of this dispute was the decision to withdraw Uribe to Chávez the mandate for negotiations on the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would "craché" in the face of Venezuela with this decision, had criticised Sunday Chávez.
Spain also Chávez is on everyone's lips.
A new Bell of Mobile Phone fact fury in the country, "qué Por No Te Callas" (why do not you tais) is the sentence that already more than half a million people downloaded it on the Internet.
She was given by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, in the most recent Ibero-American Summit, was annoyed by the constant summonses left-wing populists and told him to shut up.
Wages down threat Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economy, according to a prognosis, real wage of moins-value threat German employees this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should be expected in 2007 to a real reduction on their payslip compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies in weak development of wages, increasing the Taxe on the added value and increases in prices of food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for the macro-economy and research on the economy, " the newspaper Bild. "
Burdens also could intervene in the assurance-chômage for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said the 'Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung' that the planned reduction of the assurance-chômage of 3.3 % for the new year was correct and reasonable.
However the National Agency for Employment no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation of appropriations or financial aid, according to the SPD politician.
It showed that the explosion Tuesday food prices and oil had pushed the inflation rate to its highest level for 13 years.
In total, prices rose by 3.0 percent year on year.
Venus is the infernal twin Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus is more like Earth than we believed until now: the European Space sonde "Come Express" flash has uncovered in the atmosphere and tourbillons winds to the Poles, similar to those that occur in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists suspect that there are lightning on Venus.
The "sonde Express" came in today has shown - it has detected electromagnetic waves to the limits of the atmosphere: the Lightning sparked on Venus to a height of about 56 miles in puff, puff Christopher Russel relates to the University of California at Los Angeles in the scientific journal Nature. " '
According to the famous theory of the cyprine, the Lightning would make life on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus life: "If there was, it must have been a date to ancient history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution ' " in Washington.
There should be little things now living at the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is approximately 100 times more dense than on Earth, it is sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus is perhaps the infernal twin Earth, but it remains a" twin, said Russel.
Why Venus, which looks so the Earth masses and dimensions, was hit a development also different, is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
The departure of "Come Express" in November 2005 was an important step in research vénusienne, since no sonde was underway for the exploration of this planet since the nineties.
The opinion of researchers, research findings that have now been presented in several articles of "Nature" point out not only the oddity of Venus in the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth our planéte neighbor are more numerous than expected in the first place.
And researchers have found, besides the tourbillons winds already known to the North Pole, a maelstrom of clouds at the South Pole, which turns even faster.
The phenomenon recalls the air currents in the land hemispheres Winter, writing a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni the Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planéte solar system has almost the same mass of the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12.100 kilometres, almost as big.
The planéte star of qualified in the morning or evening revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However it turns more slowly on itself: a day vénusien harsh 243 days land.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures 460 degrees Celsius and pressure of 92 bar, does not recall the Earth, scientists suspect that the two planétes were formed in similar conditions.
On the two, the water had accumulated and remained on the Earth in oceans, but is lost in space on Venus.
And while the carbon dioxide has set on Earth carbonate form, it is on Venus most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends meet Merkel with the Dalai Lama.
President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler requires the end of the row of parties about the reception of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery.

Schäuble warns against the riots like those of France.
Street battles with police, firing, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against the riots like those of France.
Everything must be done to social dissatisfaction in Germany does not break out in the streets by violence, has demanded the Minister of Interior German.
Burning barricades, rioters who fire on the police with hunting rifles: after the serious riots by young people in France, the Minister of Interior Wolfgang Schäuble German (CDU) feared a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive contitue does not also home and be legitimised by violence.
We must take this seriously, "he said on" Neue Presse - " seemed to Hanover. "
All the young people could not happen to cope with the rapid changes of social reality.
The Federation, the federal states and municipalities were already working hard to reduce the problems, said Schäuble.
This would affect not only the integration of immigrants.
"Integration summits to conferences on Islam, this shows already its initial success."
But it would still be too early to end a warning.
Schäuble remarked at the same time that German in the suburbs, there are no problems sociological the town as France.
In areas of northern Paris, Young had carried to serious street battles with police during the recent nights.
Also in Toulouse, public buildings and cars were burnt.
Greater integration efforts from the German Government that demanded President of Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Given the riots in France, Kolat warned that the "effects of imitation."
The situation in Germany would certainly not as explosive that in France.
But it would nevertheless a need to act.
Kolat emphasises that the quota of unemployed young below 25 years from immigration would be higher than average.
We should first ensure more places to training.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
President of Turkish communities added however that social control in families had more in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration does not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat told: "But we must be careful."
We should quickly give young people the opportunity to participate in the work and training. "
Meanwhile, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, stayed very calm during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was hovering overhead the area with the spotlight.
The authorities have made three arrests and few cars and burned garbage.
Since the conference a deployment of about 1,000 security forces ensures calm.
The police will take as long as necessary, announced the Minister of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after visiting the suburb.
In the night of Tuesday, nearly 80 policemen were injured in the riots to Villiers-le-Bel.
In the next night, unrest were overcrowded, to Toulouse.
Éclatèrent riots after a traffic accident in which two young lives were lost Sunday.
According to the first elements of the public prosecutor, the police is not responsible for the death of the young.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The utopian scene of Chancellor shows that the coalition has finished with content - and that there was nothing to expect it.
What this country live Chancellor?
After his intervention awkward in general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor content, we must say: not here - not in the country who should ultimately be governed by it.
The charge of focus too much on the policy was rejected by Merkel a harsh sentence and arrogant.
Provincial is, she said, and has only shown that it does not understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, it has made visible all how this accusation was correct.
There was no concrete interest or little feelings for the country's problems to feel.
Instead, Angela during a blizzard: as a politician in weightlessness, fleeing in foreign policy and even there remains in the à-peu-près.
Such climate protection: in this, it welcomes again and again on the Heiligendam, but does not say how the climate objectives will be achieved in our country.
Even, praised ourselves - have so little modesty, the leader of the CDU would have refused even two years ago.
Now it is clinging to ready-made formulae, growth hit people.
Is it destroys his image pragmatist who solved the problems instead to embellish the world.
But in the empire of puff Angela, the internal political problems are a development which marginal.
Poverty among children and concerns of low-wage workers?
It still has a few sentences accessories for it.
In this regard is revealing the number of times it made slip when allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three démarrages sentence for a half precise.
She unsteady in uncharted territory, when it becomes practical.
The branch Attaque
In the debate on Youtube Republican candidates presidential, both Rudy Giuliani and Pet Mitt Romney are engaged in a hard battle offensive - and must now fear an outsider candidate.
Tension erupts candidates already the first issue.
It would have made New York a sanctuary "for illegal immigrants," Mitt Romney, accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
It against his side by heavy criticism: " I would say that his own house was a haven for illegals ' answers Giuliani and accuses the former governor of Massachusetts have employed undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are the attack: as the Republican base has moreover no official buzz, the eight presidential candidates are debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
Amateur films 30 seconds that Internet users have sent via Youtube are scarcely more than souffleurs.
"It is with that kind of isolationism that we left Hitler come to power," warns John McCain to its candidate Ron Paul the only in the dance to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also is lecture vigorously by Vietnam veterans when it refuses to condemn torture as a so-called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where the simule drowning.
However the fact that the important issues of the campaign now go beyond the war in Iraq and debates on torture is in the reactions of the common room of St. Petersburg in Florida.
The conservative values are leased or future increases taxes are refused, the applause déferlent in the auditorium.
This is proving again where the weaknesses of two favourite.
"I made a mistake at this time," explains seeing Romney and his apologies to the basis and the public television in 1994 for having been a supporter of abortion.
Giuliani instead happening in a knot coulant when asked his opinion on literalist interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf is for the first time.
A day after its withdrawal as head of the army, the man of Pakistani power Musharraf was invested as president.
And eight years of domination by the Army concluded.
The President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf was invested Thursday for a new five year mandate.
Pakistani television has broadcast live the ceremony at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has vowed to respect the Constitution and the wellbeing of the nation.
On Wednesday it had forwarded its burden of army commander to his confident Ashfaq Kiyani and and had bowed to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after seizing power in a coup without bloodshed, the former general is now for the first time as civilian head of state.
By this withdrawal as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had ruled 3 November.
Already shortly after his investiture Musharraf will put a hold the state of emergency, according to the Prosecutor General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus will perform another requirement of the West.
The Supreme Court, that Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers from its ranks, was rejected last week all recourse against the controversial re-election Chief State October 6.
Meanwhile five soldiers were killed in the tribal region of the North in North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others injured.
According to the spokesman of the Army, a bomb exploded in a street near the border of Afghanistan.
Krautrock fathers are their return.
The supergroupes of Germany in the 1970s rejouent: the three members of the group Harmonia have again taken their say in a concert in Berlin.
For their return appeared recordings of their great success Live 1974. "
Even then, they were much more known abroad.
The sensation scheduled happens then in the form of three gentlemen announced to the poster of the evening.
Everyone has his small box before him, his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, throne in the middle in a white shirt as snow.
It is surrounded left Michael Rother Young, 57 years and a laptop and a guitare.
Right, observed by all the auditorium, Hans - Roedelius Joachim, 73 years, reassured his curve.
Everyone contributes to noise, even a Beat.
And sometimes it inadvertently adds to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem too upset the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group plays again assured some agitation among the Krautrock fans.
It has the right to unveil here: polls show that targeted the name argues in the collective memory of the pop, but in no case sustainable manner for this group also lack painfully for 32 years.
But why German might not have the right to celebrate its living legends of the 1970s?
Because what is misleadingly "Krautrock" has always more rained in England and America in the country of origin.
Lorque the music industry has awarded in 2003 the Echo price to the survivors of Group of Cologne Can for their work, we saw in the chamber pop faces German interrogators.
When the Red Hot Chile Peppers have also thanked the groups The Düsseldorf and Neu! In the eulogy, praising the amazement had no limits.
Later, during concerts, Michael Rother sautait on stage of Red Hot Chile Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance home and the transfiguration in the unknown is the only.
The memory is already taken by Harmonia, because the trio has existed for two years and that during this period, the power to impact was felt was much weaker than what has been awarded him later by others.
Moebius Roedelius and played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the name of Cluster very promising.
We played first cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then at Düsseldorf, a label for subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother dépanné had briefly in Kraftwerk and was finally made a name like guitariste with Neu!, perhaps the German group the more radical.
In 1973, Rother followed however musicians of Cluster in exile in the fôrets of Weserbergland.
There, in a former Weser firm, a ruin of the 16th century, they have lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the Community "kommune I", where Roedelius had the right to be hurt as a nurse.
An artistic existence in Spitzweg.
So-called was in the dustbin a fanion choir of the Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Retint Harmonia very far from that.
The first album was called "Musik Harmonia von" and that " Luxe ".
Also because calm and measly that was music, the group had material.
The timber harvest death does not served alone in search of itself.
The CD Live 1974 " who just appear was recorded during a concert at Griessem before a public record of nearly 50 heads, as someone believes remember.
Rother issued at this time the desire to force Harmonia to train.
It was Roedelius and Moebius for a requirement immoral.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother atterit in spheres of ésotérisme and Assura its existence with Albums Herzen as "Flammende" (hearts in flames).
Cluster is réanima in the 1980s and has since more success than Harmonia never has been.
We must the album of Griessem Live Herbert Grönemeyer to.
His Grönland label has set the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as a German contribution inherent in contemporary music.
Neu! Had already been dug up as the staff of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia took place in the House of world cultures in Berlin.
Publicly subsidised under the Woldtronics Cinema.
Julian Cope is, the former British punk and author of "Krautrock Sampler pocket."
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. motte.
Where all of the band of the influence of Krautrock would be surrounded the future pop.
Left behind by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
The sentence of Brian Eno sits in the middle of singular sounds: "The only real music you listen to the future."
There are photographs that show producers with Harmonia in the firm.
The projections other photos in black and white cable tools used to bazaar in training the legend.
Before, the three veterans are occupied again to improvise.
But most of underpants microphones at the culmination and battery, to learn to instruments of sounds unbelievable thanks to instruments to effects built oneself.
Today, electronic music resembles the electronic music.
The three major fignoleurs of technical.
To that even the choir of the house is nothing.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, and chuchote coughing fit under the cloud of sounds and sings a lovely moment "Aaaaaaaah" rhetorically.
Krautrock has always been a concept very English.
He never acts in rock.
The roots were less looked in the blues music in the conservation of music (Can), in Technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the brain artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever shouts "68" has not completely wrong, and Harmonia also does now more annoyed by this now.
But what will the more itself will be covered thoroughly on stage.
The music begins and ends?
This can pounding the nerves of someone (?) or grant of fugaces moments of joy.
Richard Gere is simply not quite cynical.
With "The Hunting Party" and " peace " murderous, two new films tackle the Balkans war.
But the two do not convincing.
The projects are based too on the action and on the exchange of gunfire is crazy instead they are too larmoyants.
Here, Richard Gere even in "The Hunting Party" cannot help.
The good news: first the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is there, in the hinterland as mournful of the Bosnian war, that the actor Richard Gere is then recovered.
We had finally lost sight of the principal man of the 1980s, because too many gentillets and futils roles in films to feelings for women and too much press conferences on the subject of Buddhism have pleased the inclination to show.
Richard Gere today is suddenly the most important argument to watch when even "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why today's films should be as long confused that collective agreements locomotive drivers?)
It a wonderful book full of clins representation: basically, his character to postpone of War Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the destiny and industry films were not as gracious: a man who has its best moments long behind him, but, even as a monument in ruin its decline has kept the remains of his former visible charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continuing together with German production " murderous peace ", which also this week, the interminable films failures on the Balkans war.
"Murderous" peace can be quickly the trial: the film about two German soldiers in Kosovo, Adrian Topol (Riemelt), Max save a Kosovar Serb of mavericks simply, in which one quickly falls in love again.
Although it is welcome here the Serbs are for once not presented as the only cause of all evils, this film as a téléfilm dish is too quickly in action and exchanges of gunfire foolish.
This remains a sort of "Cobra alarm for 11" without motorway but with a war.
Instead, we can look in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party," why basically there has never been a real good film on the Balkans war.
The history of three American reporters who preconditions to seek out the top war criminal "the Fox", could perhaps become, with another filmmaker and another scriptwriter (both both Richard Shepard), at another time a new " Apocalypse Now. "
Because the stories are remarkably similar: two males are in small team in the forest, to do something that the military cannot do and for the two males, it becomes a trip in the madness.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that it leaves simply not Simon Hunt be cynical jumped with a heart, as it is presented in the beginning.
No, the script must also give a romantic adventure with a murdered Bosnian.
Then "The Hunting Party" is definitely wrong when the reporter, within the last five minutes, an accelerated process succeeds in NATO, the CIA and premium hunters of the world have not succeeded in five years: catch the war criminal and allow for a just to revenge Bosnian Muslims.
That is so bad that we should seize the International Court of The Hague of crime against logic of cinema.
In this case, the film has a human concern too deep.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and we suspect the Americans and the French (here they must be exceptionally agree) not drive hunting fairly intensive because political agreements secret.
But the good intentions and bad this time are so similar that a famous poême Brecht comes to the idea.
That speaks of a wooden mask a demon Asia on the table of the poête: "Compassionate, I see someone of front gonflées, clearly: as is fatiguant to be malicious."
Films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such heads tumescentes, but that implies that he is fatiguant to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films on the Balkans war.
Recently, it has been reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were major flops.
You can add: there has never been good films on South Africa.
What is true every time: when a star on behind a hotbed of crisis or a minefield, it emerged then something like "Rangoon with Patricia Arquette" Jenseits go, " Grenzen " with Angelina Jolie or " Blutdiamanten " with Leonardo DiCaprio. "
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Nevertheless, decades have always gone before that Hollywood can turn a good film about the Holocaust with "the list of Schindler."
Certain films must mature - even those who are now classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter," " Apocalypse Now " or " full Jackett Metal " have never been fêtés unanimously to their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we know today as simply too on the conflicts in the world, where each catastrophe arrives directly on two screens in the House,
And this happy to scénaristes a lack of scruples they need to tell tales of.
"To Be or Not to Be" or " the dictator " are in fact become as good because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not know yet how the Nazi regime ruled really.
Perhaps he should not attempt to be good when we want to make good flims.
Perhaps having the distancé artistic sarcastic and of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière 'and the Balkans war, he replied:" It is the fact that some things never change.'
"The big cities will always frighteningly dangerous men will always be murdered in a horrifiante and the war in Yugoslavia always there would be."
Von Beust to harvest the criticism which cancelled.
The decline of the mayor of with the candidacy of Hamburg for the Olympic Games met in politics and the economy strong criticism.
Many want to continue to fight for the Games water.
But Beust Von call to realism in appreciating opportunities.
The director of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans - Schmidt-Trenz Jörg, described abandoning Wednesday as "bad for the local economy."
These days, no other project had deployed as many forces motivation in the city that the idea of which.
"Without this, the politico-sportif momentum could be maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz urges the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point in the long-term, "which takes as its starting point another agenda changed."
The mayor Ole von Beust in remained Wednesday to its previous statements that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until the year 2028.
"This is not Hamburg decides to a candidacy which, but the German Federation of Olympic sports Von Beust said" Welt to on-line.
He renvoit the expected decision Federation Sport beginning December, about the Munich candidature for the Winter Games 2018.
This means preference for us that in the time that we had planned until 2028 so far, we have no chance. "
However the dream is not gone for good, Beust said Von.
The Federation of Hamburg sporting (HSB) lamented the statements of Beust.
That the impression is given that Hamburg does not apply to the Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It is too soon to close an opportunity, to manage projects already now", said Wednesday President of HSB Ploß Gunter.
Abandoning the candidacy would be in contradiction with the statements of the Chairman of the Senate during the reception in plenary assembly of the German Federation of colleges of sport.
Von Beust, there would have described the candidacy of Hamburg to Universiades by 2015 as "not a substitute" the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of colleges of sport in the first weeks nominated Hamburg as candidate city.
The SPD fraction of the mayor criticized the Senate not having used this valuable time in housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of Grasbrook Petit was refused by the Senate for years because he played the map of and which has excluded housing construction," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for the Petit Grasbrook an integrated plan in which and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on 'factor Event.'
The candidature for the Olympic Games in 2012 would have his hand raised in Hamburg great enthusiasm.
Hamburg was however marred against Leipzig.
This is not the Warhols coffers.
The one that connects the concepts Sweden and wooden box to think Ikea, but not to Andy Warhol.
Or if?
Currently, wooden crates manufactured in Sweden cast of shadows on the list of works by Warhol.
Much of the Ninety Brillo-Boxs 'type of Stockholm' listed there are contrefaÇons.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" has questioned a few months the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxs of the year of 1968 Andy Warhol, research of internal Moderna Stockholm Museet up today to a désenchanteur result: six " Brillo-Boxes ", whose former museum director Pontus Hulten was gift in 1995 to Moderna Museet, are copies - and a lot of other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen 'type of Stockholm,' circulating on the international market for art.
History is enchevêtrée, a disconcerting sequence of artistic productions and curatoriques.
In 1964, Warhol created New York its first "Brillo-Boxes", wooden crates peintes based on the design of rouge-bleu-blanc boxes of soap powder " Brillo. "
An exhibition of his work on Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with the agreement of Warhol - Hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: they did not originate from (for financial reasons) of Warhol, but were directly exposed to the cartonnage Brillo factory.
It was not art, but rather their models, samples of exposure.
At the same time, Warhol had given authorisation in 1968 to produce some wooden Brillo boxes in Sweden, who were not exposed to Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time now speak with around fifteen wooden boxes, which would be entered in the history of art and auction as Brillo-Boxes Andy Wahrol of original allowed, with names like "the Stockholm."
Some of them have achieved in the auctions over 100 000 dollars.
The problem now is that the legendary director Pontus Hultén Museum has claimed, wrongly, later that around 100 wooden boxes had been produced and aired in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then Utrecht.
In truth, the 105 Hultén coffers were produced in Malmö in 1990, only to exposure to Petersburg.
To this date, Warhol was already dead for three years.
Lars Byström, head of the conservative Moderna Museet, examined, alongside six Brillo-Boxes Museum, three other private collections of suedoises, including two were confectionnées in Stockholm in 1968: their stratifiés panels were first printed and poncés, then it has applied with a points of oil paint.
The texture copies of 1990 unveils instead that the painting was directly applied without bottom layer on the stratifiés panels, using a scroll of paint more - it is not an oil paint, but a acrylique.
"These funds have not been permitted by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Brillo-Boxes Andy Warhol of", the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: " If the " Authentication Andy Warhol Board'Art in New York did not just another decision, the Moderna Museet six classera in his vintage coffers as copies / material exposure.'
Already in July the Authentication Board has announced that it look into the "serious accusations" that will be raised in the case of soapboxes powder.
But since we halo there of a inéxorable silence.
The Soldats Rebels abandon Manila
In the Philippines, soldiers, rebels abandon the same who took shelter in a hotel in Manila, and which had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The chief Antonio Trillanes, who was the President corruption and electoral fraud, said to reporters in the hotel that it cannot respond to any bloodshed.
The soldiers loyal to power shortly before had stormed the hotel with lacrimogène gas.
The two dozen soldiers were retranchées for hours in the building.
About half of them were held Wednesday in court because of an abortive coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.

The Conseiller for national security Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of soldiers.
"People have had enough," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who called before the elite unit of Rangers Scouts, said that other units of the Army wanted shortly join the march.
Critics of the regime had called for a large demonstration against President Wednesday.
His government is surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
The financial district of Manila was already since 2003 the scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo.
The insurgency has brisa nearly 24 hours after the refusal of the army to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a Versatel main shareholder.
United Internet secured a participation of over 20 % of the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price for action is 14,46 euros, as the company used Wednesday.
Only 20,05 percent of the social capital would be held.
We had already speculated earlier on a takeover.
The option would remain open to further increase the participation in Versatel.
With no one seeks to accelerate the consolidation of the German market of DSL, gave United Internet.

Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
