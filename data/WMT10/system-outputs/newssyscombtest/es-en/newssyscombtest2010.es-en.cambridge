The lack of snow in the mountains of concern to the hotel
Not only those of Telesquíes in Krkonoie are concerned about the runways without snow.
The lack of snow makes people not reserved stays ski in hotels and pensions.
That is why, in Krkonoie still can get rooms free for all dates, including Christmas Eve and.
We have many visitors in our pages.
People look at the offers, checked prices, but still is afraid of setting aside with compromise.
And if we call, they ask immediately about our opinion, if this Christmas there will be snow or mud, "mentioned the portal information Spindl. Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to move in Pindlerv Mlýn a According to their expectations, should not hesitate more in reserve the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, may try to wait a few more days.
The hotel of Pindlerv Mlýn offer above all weekly stays for.
I think that will continue offering, but soon and will provide stays shorter.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, estimated Jandura.
Ingotours, a travel agency in Vrchlabí, continues to offer beds free for all dates of winter.
Now what interests us most is the week of Christmas, which is not yet complete.
Half of the seats is still free.
That is why we have already prepared some stays at the last moment, "said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The travel agency of Vrchlabí still can also offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoie, but there are fewer free seats.
Sold very well the first 14 days of February, the remaining dates are sold regulate.
This year the interest in the rooms is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoie.
People are waiting to see whether there will be snow.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountain without snow.
If the clues remain snowfall during the week, the dates of Christmas will dry up, "thinks Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to fill the rooms in the hotel in SGP pod Snkou; last year was more difficult.
We are approximately five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the latest vacancies.
The interest increases during Polish holidays in January and February also sells well, "reported the director of the best hotel in SGP, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of the rooms of already busy in the hotel, near the heart Janské Lázn.
On the contrary, in the latest hotel of Janské Lázn at Christmas half the beds is still free.
This January was a big surprise to us, as we are about a 60 per cent of the capacity of occupation.
February has been a bit weaker, but as fall snow, interest in the stays in Krkonoie will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the hotel.
However, at the moment it seems that the hotel of Krkonoie they will the appetite of snow waiting.
On Thursday, must fall temperatures and, if there is rain in the mountains should Nevar.
But then again rise temperatures, reported Jií Jakubský of Králové, of the Institute Hidrometeorológico of the Czech Republic.
USA.: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the most intelligent man, as a pupil diligent repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, he took on the more foolish.
When finally revealed his Afghan approach, looking forward, it showed that it is a copy of the script used to Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is used several times the "as in Iraq", but do not hesitate to use the title of Bush's statement of January 2007 for his own statement: "a new way forward".
Was he, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea to send new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering by the civil war. And that was criticised as "an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences".
The following month, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of captains of countryside, was the only possible and successful, so today nothing about Iraq on the news.
Bush's reputation not improved, however objectively left to his successor an initial situation much more favourable than had been anticipated.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes to repeat the miracle.
The captains of field returned to ask him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander in chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley Mccristal. Him, even though the traditional relations subordinate, submitted to the Fusileros undecided in the White House to tough criticism.
Asked 40,000 men in order to improve the situation.
The president hesitate for three months, but thought nothing better, so at least misled the general about 10,000 military.
Managed to get Europe's promised other 5,000, although he previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of all of Obama's strategy seems to be his goal, to begin to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finish this process in three years. Entire doctrine of Obama led to more questions of the answers offered.
Many doubt that the increase will give the same result as the procedure in Iraq.
In spite of the fratricidal wars in recent years, the society of Iraq is relatively well organised, their leaders to respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: It is not possible to rely on anyone and no agreement has been met.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are accustomed to change the head every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin. After he will remain the tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complicated because relations, even more complicated by the Pakistani influences and Iranian.
Not even establish a state that is "capable of action", a minimum target for the entire operation, seems very real.
The prospect of Obama's strategy is at odds with his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and now is about to erupt.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to the war to "return home' soon, will make some miracle here.
From a political point of view, set the date for the withdrawal of troops is sheer irresponsibility, because the Taliban will see this as an indirect statement of the American defeat.
The last summit of NATO showed that Europeans have less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, and do not want to explain to their constituents, what has the security of Germany or Italy with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, can dramatically affect the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, USA. Will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begin the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, every solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years for the presidential election and therefore there is still plenty of time to find another strategy, if it is a total failure.
The bank's managers Goldman Sachs will no longer receive the cash bonuses
Senior executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive this year's bonuses in cash.
The entity announced to react to the harsh criticism of its pay practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, rather than money, actions that can not be sold at a minimum term of five years.
In addition, the actions can be withdrawn in the event that had taken on excessive risks.
According to the agency Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to unite the bonuses on Wall Street with the power in the long term.
I suppose that Wall Street is fully aware of the longest journey to be undertaken, mentioned the former banking investor of the entity Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs faced criticism after (almost 17 000 million dollars (almost 300 billion Czk) for bonuses, in the first three quarters of this year.
The sum total of the bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the agency Reuters, probably exceed, despite the measure announced today, the 20 billion dollars.
High bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, in a delicate issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax at once, with a tax of 50 per cent, the bonuses for banking that exceed the 25,000 pounds (approximately 712.000 Czk).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year the women received the Nobel Prize winners in all categories less physical
Five women, which is a record figure, received today in Stockholm in the hands of King Carlos XVI of Sweden this year's Nobel prizes, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientific, between rewarded also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for medicine as received two American Biólogas, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of the chromosomes.

The winner took the diploma, the medal of Prize and the certificate of money received.
This amount in each category is up to 10 million Swedish kronor (about 25 million Czech kroner).
In the case of having several rewarded in each category, the prize is shared between themselves.
The traditionally more expected, the peace, received today afternoon in Oslo, Norway, US president Barack Obama.
In his speech acknowledged the controversy had been rewarded, as it is at the beginning of his career and is at the head of a country that is involved in two wars, in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
To defend its policy added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even though its price is high.
The minister Janota considers the resignation. Klaus I invited the castle
The president Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning by Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which is considering his stay in the government, because it does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
The budget is supposed to be, and perhaps also the permanence of Janota in the cabinet, will be the subjects of their meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis in public finances.
On the meeting reported the president's spokesman Radim Ochvat.
On his stay in the role, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the law on the budget, ready to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163.000 million kroner.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the proposals from the left for the transfer of funds and raised the money for the salaries of civil servants, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the Social Democrats' proposals, since they do covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and right on the other, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. Because of this conflict, are beginning to be controversial future activities of bureaucratic cabinet of Fischer, whose form was agreed in the spring by the ODS, SSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of measures, imposed in the autumn by Fischer's government to rein in public borrowing.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long neglected "serious problem", that is, "the deficit is not sustainable" of public finances.
According to him today do not have a good solution.
Only a strong government, to support a broader consensus among the political parties, could improve this situation, does the president.
The leader of ODS Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is appalling and that the government should consider its future existence.
The vice-president of ODS, Petr Neas, said to TK that the concept of bureaucratic cabinet with the support of SSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
The prime minister Fischer reacted and described similar words of' strong judgments ".
The head of SSD, Jií Paroubek, reacted by saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by former government Topolánek. The 200 billion kroner.
On Wednesday SSD said that the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The popular were also happy.
Mandela in the new film of Clint Eastwood, interpreted by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans say that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: invincible, much about the country, their fight and their victories, although some critics say that the protagonists the play American players.
History speaks of sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted as a biography by the American actor winner of an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91 years, asked him in the film.
Another important role it plays Matt Damon.
I said to her: "When I interpret, I will have to have access to you.
The actor and two years, which received the prize for his role in the drama about the world of boxing milion dollar baby, played the role of the leader of the Movement for the abolition of slavery, which ended up being the slave, the president of the USA., and even of God as omnipotent. But rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, it is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for their activities in order to end the apartheid in South African Republic.
It was released in in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - invincible is a word America and the title of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was speaking as he
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the team of South African rugby, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after the apartheid their nation remains racial and economically divided.
Believes that is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why we decided to unite the rugby players, who belong to the extent to the world.
The South African team fails to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years for the history of Mandela came to cinemas.
He had another goal to play this role in such a way that was as similar as possible to the reality, said Freeman.
Of course, the greatest challenge was speaking as him.
The actor said that if he and the political world in the same area, had tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake hands with Mandela.
I found that my hand, I receive its energy, it is transmitted and had the feeling to know how you feel, she said.
It is important for me to try on a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, which dominated the white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was, when finally met for the first time with Pienaar at home.
I remember pointing to the door, he opened and the first thing that I told François Pienaar in my life was in the film: "much higher".
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the players and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: invincible received positive and there is also talk of ambitions for the Oscar.
The film critic of the magazine Daily Variety McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well done film."
In the film on the website rottentomatoes. Com, Invictus received a 76 percent of positive assessments.
The secret of the splendour on Norway resolved: the Russians did tests of a missile
On Norway observed a special of unknown origin.
Russia's defense ministry ended yesterday recognising that close to the borders with Norway did tests of a missile intercontinental ballistic.
The launch failed again. The missile, type "Bulava", previously designed to be the pride of the Russian army, is turning into the nightmare of the Russian generals and prime minister Putin.
Not even his repeated presence at the missile tests has had the desired effect in the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, they came out flying or there was a flaw in the air.
In Russian newspapers write of "Bulavá" as "a missile that did not fly."
A missile that did not fly, but is conspicuous.
For this, the evidence, there was no problem at the outset.
At the end of the flight there were again technical problems in the apparatus.
Probably the engine broke out in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which plunged into the sea paper.
This type of missile launched from a boat that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an object wheel not identified, was in fact the failed "Bulavá."
The Norwegians like from the first moment that this were a Russian missile.
The generals this time defending saying that you can not simply speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In previous cases engines are immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without errors, according to the management of the ministry of defence only six of the 13 were unsuccessful.
The success of almost 50 per cent full of optimism to the generals and that is why still claim that "Bulavá" a day without problems and even manage to take up to ten blocks Hipersónicos nuclear, whose total weight maximum is of 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov signed the 51 years an annual contract with CSKA Moscow

Fetisov ended his career at the age of 40 years in 1998 and currently chairs the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was wounded, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov constantly practiced and is committed to helping the team.
We have only to solve some formal affairs, cited the agency PA to Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the club in Moscow.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single party.
I think Fetisov is one of those who manage to lift the mood of the other players mentioned Nemchinov.
According to PA if Fetisov again the runways of ice, will become the professional player most of the Russian hockey.

Hyundai fulfilled the requirements of the unions. All the extra work
The direction of the car plant at Noiovice agreed with the unions cancel all the extra work.
Precisely because of the frequent extra work, the unions declared the emergency on Monday to strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vank, the spokesman of the factory Automoviles Hyundai.
Management, however, wants for this year with the unions agreeing a time for Saturday.
We can not resign ourselves to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed additional work voluntary for Saturday 19 December, in other words, it will work in two shifts, said VANK.
According to the server Sedmika. Cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 Czk employees who work Saturday's turn.
The bonus is also paid by last Saturday, 28 November.
According to Vaka, the company decided to change the way to motivate their employees with the extra work offered.
Employees can collect the bonus for overtime or can take a free day on 28 December, that is to say, prolonging a day Christmas festivities mentioned VANK.
In addition, all employees of Saturday shifts will receive money for the trip and for the food.
Because the extra work was the most urgent and problematic of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, to stop the production last week, the direction yesterday afternoon decided to immediately cancel all the extra work for the month of December, mentioned VANK.
Employees of the factory cars were forced to work two hours plus shifts of eight hours and this situation prevailed practically every day until last week.
After signing the agreement the unions lapse the emergence of strike.
Another negotiation between the factory's management and trade unionists must take place on Monday morning.
The head of the trade unions Petr Kucha said on Wednesday that if commitment to meet the requirements and signed the document, are prepared to cancel the emergency on strike.
The situation in the car factory was compounded last week on Wednesday, when some 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for the frequent extra work.
Also protested against the poor conditions of payment and the alleged harassment.
The direction that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and to provide the cars.
Trade unionists in his declaration of emergency by Monday's strike, also demanded that any of the employees, who last Wednesday interrupted the manufacture, were penalised in any way.
In terms of the extra work, the unions are demanding that the company will be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, this year required for this work remuneration of 5,000 kroner.
The car factory in Noiovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Series production was launched last November.
Until last September manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is of 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech discovery: a substance effective until in the Encallecidos' virus HIV
The team of scientists Czechs and Germans makes testing of new compounds capable of holding down the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of improved this substance is the fact that it is also effective against viruses resistant to medication.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some drugs available already.
The disease AIDS can not be cured until now.
However, the lives of patients can significantly thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent replication of HIV virus in the body.
However, their use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus were not removed completely, it will create the so-called virus resistant; against them, they no longer work medicines.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Vcht Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility to dominate the resistance of the virus.
Showed that substances called Metalocarboranos have effect on the albumin, responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The Metalocarboranos are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds are blocking the spread of the virus in a different way to all drugs used today, and so can solve the problem of resistance.
In his work scientists are new, improved compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of its link to the virus.
The Metalocarboranos have a single three-dimensional structure: two cages Poliedros composed of atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon are united by the atom of metal, in this case by Cobalt.
A virus traitor and resilient
The Proteasis HIV is a virus HIV, and it is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the Proteasis of HIV, there is the fragmentation of the HIV virus and not create mature and infectious diseases Corpúsculos of the virus.
If the Proteasis HIV, also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists in a press report published by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of medicinal chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are united by a short series organic, which continues to be amended.
A little weaker, but more effective
The evidence of the effect of this number of substances against Proteasis HIV was made in, and also against their resistant variations, obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of the Metalocarboranos in the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in medicines used, but not lose their effect on the resistant variations, in which the drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, their other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, the lower toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, that the Metalocarboranos are compounds interesting for research with the aim of proposing effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlína Ezáová, the head of the laboratory of structural biology at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetica in the Academía of Sciences.
For the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he argues
The head of ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the approved budget for next year is "appalling" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think their future existence.
The statements of ODS were identified by the prime minister as strong judgments.
They say that it is time for analysis.
The vice-president of ODS Petr Neas said that the concept of bureaucratic cabinet with the support of SSD, ODS and the Green Party clearly no longer works.
According to the prime minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies wants to rely on the minority, which seeks to combat the growing deficit, or if it wants to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social Democración towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, warned Neas.
Yesterday the Chamber of Deputies approved the budget for 2010, but with the proposals by the left, for more than 12 billion kroner.
The chamber of deputies raised the money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's proposals ODS, because Cubiertamente increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion kroner.
ODS before the vote left the room and realized the desire of the government, that the amended budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusionment and futility
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, spoke of the disappointment and sense of futility; Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will assess the current situation.
Neas is convinced that if Janota seriously threaten the resignation in case of approval of the proposals Modificadoras, the situation could have been different.
According to Televize Janota requested a meeting with the prime minister.
He said, which is planning to stay in the role.
The reason is his disappointment with the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer will agree with another fight against the budget deficit, according to the government have nothing to do the nominated by the SSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The prime minister also should clearly say, if resign, if the House approves other laws to increase the deficit, for example those concerning subsidies in disease, income, or the amendment of the law of service.
Topolánek: ministers nominated by the ODS are not
It is the subject of the prime minister Fischer and the government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have not done anything wrong, stressed in the news of the US.
Recalled, that in several ministries in the jobs of people who belong to the top 09, who voted against the budget.
Neas stressed, that if Fischer decides the principle of the fight with the height of the deficit of public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which is based on the left-wing majority, which is currently in the chamber of deputies".
But it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the members of ODS.
I have not thought about that, when the time comes, I will deal with this, told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government by the states of ODS.
The prime minister Fischer afternoon came to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS surrendered at the request of the prime minister
Neas stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the chamber of deputies probably would vote against the amended budget, if the prime minister does not explicitly calls to members of ODS which allow the acceptance of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, responded to the question, if ODS not worried by the absence of the head of the party in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during negotiations on the budget.
I realised that my vote.
The mandate resign knew, that in the following months they were especially Bolchevización of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, reacted Topolánek.

Eské Dráhy (Czech Railways) from 13 December lapse or Restringuirán some fast trains and local least used and, on the contrary, will strengthen some links.
The total length of the traffic will be reduced by two percent compared with the day today, after the new timetable of trains comes into force.
The majority of charges including the basic price and customer will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital gain for example the inhabitants of the region of Ostravsko, Dráhy for this line added Unacarretería Pendolino.
The direct train, on the contrary, it will not travel to Bratislava.
In the Line Prague - Písek - Eské BUDJOVICE less fast trains, Restringuirán direct links Prague - Letohrad.
In the regions, the largest reduction of transport planned by Dráhy is in the region of Králové, eight percent in total, to the contrary, the transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
They also lapse two night trains in the Prague - Tábor - Eské BUDJOVICE and some fast trains in the line Prague - Písek - Eské BUDJOVICE will be reduced to just a few days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new hotline of Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice must change in NAD.
This is the 15. Line of the system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line of NAD to Milovice.
The links long distances to the capital will end up in the station Prague Hlavní Nádraí.
D will introduce more links SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Umperk / Jeseník move every two hours.
After the December 13 passengers will not travel to Bratislava in Pendolino.
The account by regional rail this year, 200 million more than before
The fast trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called losses demonstrable Dráhy will receive next year four billion kroner in total, like this year. Local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year will pay eight billion kroner in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For the fast trains and local Dráhy have a new contract for ten years, until now the contract was always a year.
Dráhy are happy with the system, and perhaps that is why did not increase the price of a large majority of the tickets.
The changes will take place only in tickets a day - D net and cheap tickets Internet Eliika.
For travelers without card customer the price D net increase of 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of Eliika will depend on the distance, until now there was a single price of 160 kroner for travel between any two regional cities.

The history of RSA concerns around the world, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days in US cinemas a new Hollywood film, Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official title in Czech Esinvictus: Neporaený), which captures a part of the biography of the former president of the Republic of South African Nelson Mandela.
The role of the globally known fighter against apartheid what plays Morgan Freeman, who chose years ago for the leading role Mandela himself.
The second, the role of the legendary champion in rugby Francoise Pienaar, interpreted Matt Damon.
With the debut of the reactions of the critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Its full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. Was born on July 18. 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.

Morgan Freeman, however, says he is proud of the new film.
For many years dreamed of the role and I was preparing to play.
Many times I found myself in person with Nelson Mandela, for, as they say - charge your energy, said in an interview after the festive debut in Los Angeles.

Janura will submit a complaint for slander three Hetmánes of SSD
The owner of student agency Radim Janura today will submit a complaint for slander three Hetmánes Socialdemocráticos.
This is Micha in the region Jihomoravský Kraj, Radko Martínek of Pardubický Kraj and Hetmán of Olomoucký Kraj Martin Tesaík.
Janura mentioned in 20 minutes Radiournál.
The demand has to do with the effort of the company, maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions but ended up signing contracts in the long term with Eské Dráhy.
All three Hetmánes are attacking us and they talk about the fact that we are taking the "on the cake', but brought only supply for what they wanted.
Say, that we are more expensive than Eské Dráhy, which is not true. We know the price of Eské Dráhy, which were set last week.
So we have something else to defend ourselves.
It is for the slander towards society student agency, said to Radiournál Janura.
At the same time have the evidence of all regions. He does not have taken necessary steps in harmony with European law.
Why is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Consider this complaint by the continuation of the show medial of Mr Janura, serving as free publicity for his company and for himself.
Of course I am prepared to defend my good name and that of my region and I appeal to the other Hetmánes to do so also.
I suppose, that this time it will demonstrate clearly, that Mr Janura manipulated the public on the issue of regional rail transport, and uses arguments liars and false, mentioned.
Janura announced last week, which invested several million kroner in advertising, the aim would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
To Radiournál told, that Interrupiría the campaign after Christmas and wants continued after the new year.
Specified, that the campaign will be carried out against the Corupción as such.
Janura began the campaign after the regions were agreed with Eské Dráhy in maintaining regional rail links and for the job of approximately 150 billion kroner called not an aim.
According to Janura similar steps are in disagreement with the law and with the opinion of the European court.
Janura claims to have been threatened by a member of SSD, because of his criticism of transport in the regions.
The only threat was, that if we leave, we will lose the licences of buses.
Was presented as a member of SSD, I know, what Mr it is, I will not say his name, said Janura today for Radiournál.
The vaccine Neumococal will be free and voluntary
The vaccine Neumococal from January will put an end to the usual habits.
As the first vaccine must be free to families and at the same time voluntary.
But already appear views, of which the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against Neumococos.
The Institute of Medicine is already setting the maximum price of vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
The experts also already have clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
vaccines for children born in August
From January will be able to receive the vaccine Neumococal children born since 2 August last year.
The condition is not having received either a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who began with the vaccine last year or earlier, you have to cover other doses of the vaccine, too.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and the fifth month of age of a child.
Last year a quarter of families left voluntarily to vaccinate their children against Neumococos.
Parents however paid for a dose 1600 kroner and more.
To vaccinate children smaller needed four doses.
Experts estimate that insurance companies will spend in vaccines 300 to 450 thousand kroner annually.
However in the treatment, which is needed for children are not vaccinated.
So far the state spent by the vaccination of children around 500 thousand annually.
The vaccination deck was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
The Neumococo is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and shock.
Of the infections Neumococales in our country every year die, according to research in the hospitals 28 children over the age of 10.
In addition to the Czech Republic the deck vaccine Neumócocal in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Is the vaccine will be mandatory?
However at the same time appear views, that this vaccine could be compulsory in future.
From January should be covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, for example, said Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the Civic Association Nahlas.
Their partnership spreads vaccines Neumococales already for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, in which our partnership was involved, were not completely Satisfechoscon the fact that we have voluntary vaccine.
It is not ideal.
On the other hand we are happy, to get at least this.
I think that this is the path that we now have to take, mentioned Kalovský.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the procedure of vaccination against Neumococos.
At the moment I do not think at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Srie.
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, say doctors
The president of the society of pediatricians Odborná Spolenost Praktických Dtských Léka Cabrnochová, acknowledges that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children would receive the vaccine, may be thinking about reducing the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, relatively understand the political decision of initiating vaccination as voluntary," says Cabrnochová.
The experts expect that from next year more than 80 percent of young parents leaves vaccinate against Neumococos to their babies.
The vaccine Neumococal is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by the health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on the prophylaxis, to save then in treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors have to buy the vaccine for themselves.
However the pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, the vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some members but they were afraid, that insurance companies could "take the money from the health insurance."
Doctors therefore will have to buy vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that invest in vaccines 40 thousand a month, which is a significant sum.
Nothing will be easy, says Cabrnochová.
Still them and us
Can the Islam to be French?
pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have requested to ban the construction of minarets and that there is widespread alert on the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a detailed report and studied on the possible integration of Muslims (which actually are integrating) in one of the most openly societies of the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the latest work from the author why the French do not like the veils "(" The French do not like Headcarves "(2006), an elegant study and argued for a problem which divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are seen even today.
Mr Bowen's latest book has a broader perspective and more ambitious.
As a good anthropologist, wants to know not only what they are saying politicians and the media about Islam in France, but what is actually happening.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France which Mr Bowen called Islamic spaces ".
He is a good that reproduces discussions between teachers and students on the questions most interested in.
Should a Muslim to marry in a mosque or in a city (or both)?
should teach them to young Muslims on the evolution and gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman to marry a man not Muslim?
Is it legitimate that a Muslim used a banking system based on interests to get a mortgage?
Are these seemingly mundane issues, argues, things of daily life, the concerns of the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an academic and scholar Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is open the debate on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a secular modern society.
Unable to disseminate this argument completely.
The conservatives doubt just the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr Bowen interview tend to disagree with their counterparts from Salafi, supporters of Sunni Islam linked to Saudi Arabia, who now have a small but influential presence among Muslims of Europe.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and the French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires give and take.
Question the extent to which policymakers French (and intellectual elite that so fiercely defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
Suggests that Muslims are probably a more unfair treatment that Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have had to make their historic commitments with the secular Republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, perceived an adjustment of values ".
Can the Islam to be French? After reading this book, one tends to say yes, but not yet. "
The most devastating picture of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other habitat on the planet.
Defining the ice is melting at an alarming speed, taking with them the life that can not survive on any other side.
The interests of the oil, gas, transport and fisheries have been approached in newly opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and authors now, as a result of this.
In on thin ice "(" on thin ice ") Richard Ellis, a writer and enlightening, depicts a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Aware of the complicated history and politics of the hunting of whales, describes the long tradition of the Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of value to the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson as a courageous Cadete of 14 years, fighting only with the edge of Jerez, is certainly a myth, but others are true.
The offspring, captured while Nadaban following the bodies of their mothers newly exterminated, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A presentation of circus at the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, the pens of zoos are generally still a part of the area of the scope of an adult wild. The climate is almost never right: a polar bear resident in Singapore was green algae that grow in areas without hair of their shapes and sizes.

Ellis uses stories of other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters submitted to the survival of the species.
Although it is banned in Norway, US. And Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and Indians Inuits in Motonieves used assault guns of high power to overturn their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters to the North of those two nations where the ice will last for much longer.
In his new book, after the ice "(" The ice "), Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling tale about the science of the Arctic and a look of how to transform the future of that place.
Is not that the scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
It is not for lack of effort.
Travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century gave evidence for the first time about the movement of the masses of ice.
Then the submarines of the Cold War a map of the Movedizos cordons of ice circulating under the masses of ice.
The satellite and the extensive series of probes in the icebergs are a useful supplement, but individuals resistant camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr Anderson looks within the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice, made up of Chorritos of water that while freezing.
But since the bear in the area until the wonders of the market, are all doomed once the summer ice withdrawal, which it believes can happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months ... These could be us
Marines among the 6,000 who place kroner in the graves of Arlington
Pfc. De'angello Robinson, of 19 years, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single wreath at the grave of a soldier who had never known.
For him and the other Marines who travelled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N. C., to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who were once standing in their boots.
In a few months, from where we are embarking, these could be us, said Robinson about soldiers killed.
If we, I would like to see someone do the same for me, therefore only treatment to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who met Saturday morning to place kroner on the graves of veterans in several sections of Arlington cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the company of SEK Worcester in Harrington, Maine, opened the event when he and others decided several hundreds of graves in the cemetery in Arlington.
In what is already a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year in different cities along the way, for events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit organization, wreaths America, that the event has spread to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 kroner in the graves of the cemetery of Arlington, areas in the Pentagon, graves in the cemetery national Fayetteville in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and at the memorial site for the Flight 93 of United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the WalMart foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the kroner.
Charleen hunt, 70, of Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a deceased military career.
While her husband is buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It is like visiting a grave of family.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothes, volunteers walked through the vast meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers addressed to most old graves of World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War, because they do not get many visits as the new graves, the organisers said.
The atmosphere was Alegre while the children were playing and couples were taken by the hand, while wearing the pine fresh to the Sepulcrales.
Each move was a deep green, with a small red ribbon tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association for the soldier) donated 1,000 kroner to decorate the section, but the grim atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, others Rezaron, and the families and friends supported each other in the air.
Some read aloud names carved in stone, while others were inclined to see small collectors white and black placed within the mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers Enjugaban tears in his eyes in front of the grave of her son.
Handled eight hours since Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of the Marine Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should never forget why we are free.. My son paid for it, he said.
"Long after my death I want someone can remember."
Cuban official arrested a contractor for the US government
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor for the US government to mobile and portable computers in the country, said on Saturday the officials of the State Department.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for development alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the Agency for International Development in the United States and the World Bank.
Consular official with the US Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although according to the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything deemed "dangerous".
All the so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include minor protests and critical writings, bring the risk of arrest.
The graffitti government and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a nascent community, led by the popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes on as she and her husband are followed and harassed by agents of the government.
Sanchez has on several occasions requested permission to leave the country to accept awards, but it has been refused permission.
The arrest of an American contractor can cause probably tensions between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been looking for a rapprochement "slow pace" to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to publish the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new American policy emphasises that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space to the opposition, there will be reciprocity of part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new products and in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile only this year; they are used mainly for text messages, as a 15 - minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
The use of the Internet is extremely limited in the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and at some establishment of the government, as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Glory Berbena, official press in the US Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the handful of American citizens in the prison in Cuba is behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said he could not provide more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, as mobile free, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of the organisation Human Rights Watch, which recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, known as "new Castro, same Cuba", a reference to the site of Raúl Castro as leader of the country, replacing his older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in a day.
He said that any solution would probably policy, and that the Cuban government often leads to a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are beginning to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials Desenmarañan a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday the Pakistani authorities to the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five men of Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying that they expect that the case will help unravel an extensive network of terrorists, who travel the Internet in search of radicalised young.
The researchers said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks in the siege of Internet videos YouTube.
Saifullah approached the men once were in Pakistan, trying to help them to reach the remote area in the tribal belt of Pakistan, which is a familiar place for Al Qaeda and its terror training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince the commanders of Al Qaeda that the men were not part of a plot by the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Therefore the isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the mountains of the Northwest, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
For this reason were rejected, said the official, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that the men not Inmutaron and even were trying to get the proper approval for access to the camps of Al Qaeda, when Pakistani police authorities the arrested.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI, underscores the critical role of those in the identification of potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who are of confidence.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, US intelligence has as top priority try to Infiltrar people within Al Qaeda.
The organization acting as guards, leaving not those who do not show a serious commitment to holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said that Al Qaeda analyses with special attention to American recruits applicants.
But for the organisation represent a huge attraction, because of its potential to gain access to American objectives and because of their propaganda value.
But Kohlmann, senior analyst for the foundation NEFA based in the United States, said that the terrorist groups also have become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those who admit, because American intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to Infiltrar someone in these groups, what better way to follow the model of recruitment what so many have already followed? said Kohlmann.
It has been transformed into a model based far more on the Web.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding "action"
On Saturday tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here demanding the negotiators who work in the centre of conventions beautiful center of the city, bolder actions to the climate.
The demonstrators said 100,000 people took part in the event, but the police estimated that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the centre of the city.
On a day in which little happened in the climate talks sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists have walked the city claiming banners in English saying "there is no planet B" and one in Spanish that declared, "Land said" enough is enough ".
Several famous joined the protest, including the Danish model and Helena Christensen, who said that travel Peru, the homeland of his mother, made me aware of the issues with which the country must contend with the impacts of climate changes that are already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I decided to join the large demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to come up with a fair, ambitious and binding, said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way any longer.
Police prevented the protesters too the beautiful center, and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the use of masks or carrying of pocket knives.
Under Danish law, those activities are banned during the demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in the discussions on the climate, some activists with sporting masks and black dresses placed several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
Were in the buildings, he said, adding that began as Llamaradas, but which were followed by "a couple of explosions great."
In the centre of conventions, people met around TV screens to look at the progress throughout the afternoon.
But the protests seemed not penetrate the awareness of key officials as its Wei, chief negotiator of China on the climate.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration was taking a constructive impact on international deliberations, replied in English, "really was not aware of the situation".
Then followed by saying in Mandarin, "as the place of meeting is great, I can hear what is going on outside."
He said that depended on the prospect of each define if the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "You can also say that affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
The data from a test reveal persistent racial differences
The federal ratings last week on the performance in mathematics, it was a very good news for the public schools in the district capital.
Although the district is still far from the best performance systems in the country, the report card showed that students in fourth and eighth degree gave strides to a more rapid pace over the past two years, with regard to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains engraved on the recent figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent difference in performance between students African-Americans and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white students in fourth degree of D. C. Over the past two years, grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but his peers African-Americans rose just three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact the difference in yield rose between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in the eighth level remained essentially fixed, falling a negligible point statistically, of 245 to 244.
The average scores of whites were not included in the results of the test, because the size of the sample was not large enough.
Over an extension of six years, the picture is no more encouraging.
The gap that separated the pupils white and black fourth degree in 2003, when it was revealed the first Enpe in the district, was 60 points of the scale (262 at 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has been reduced to 58.
Some lawyers of education in the district expressed concern last week, as the advances held by the rector Michelle to. The Rhee and mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were driven largely by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole view of those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and controversial, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D. C. Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates the educational equity in the district.
I am not giving leaps of joy by a difference of two or three points, said a member of the Council of the D. C., Kwame R. Brown (Dem group. - for accumulation), who has a daughter at the fourth degree of the Eaton Elementary.
Brown, a critic of the administration style of Rhee, said that the message of the scores of proof is that secondary schools in the city have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But the concern is that we are not spending the time or the energy needed for our schools.
Rhee said the district needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of students of under performance.
This autumn, for example, is training to some teachers to use a new curriculum of reading, the system of reading Wilson, addressed to students in the higher grades of primary school and a half, which dominated the fundamentals of reading early in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
The mathematics of every day, a mathematics curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes games and experiences in real life, which was introduced in the district under the former superintendent Clifford Janey, which has something of the progress reported by the Enpe last week.
Only I think we have to continue working to offer the best speeches to students who are below the level of degree, said Rhee.
Others say that the results of the Enpe highlights the issue of whether Rhee can continue to increasing the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for schools with low performance, which will be necessary to reduce the difference.
Here there is a sort of dilemma rocky for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, studying scores of urban tests.
The solution of conventional policy is spending its resources and reforms of administration to schools located in the poorest sections of the D. C.
Then the goal can generate political impact that run counter to that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other cities, it is clinging to the middle class white and black.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our schools Barriales, so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can have access to an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the difference in performance is extending the year of traditional public school, currently of 180 days in the district, to compete with autonomous schools.
To reach nearly 200 days to have the strength of change, said Janey, which came to an agreement with the trade union of their teachers last year in a year of 185 days, which it regards as an "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
Make higher education a part of most future
The tourist bus came to the University of Gettysburg with a strong.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years, fell and blinked during a moment before the white columns, the facades of brick and the Meadows.
The parents of Graciela barely had been in a secondary school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Still, when she and the other pupils eighth degree of the group Gettysburg, where the number plate costs 38.690 dollars a year, his attitude was less of guests impressed that of enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! It is here where I will be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the guide announced that it had entered the building of Sciences.
Goodness, seriously?, he said, when the guide spoke of the low proportion Profesor-estudiantes of the school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children had visited on his trip in three days, and had already absorbed completely its deliberate message: the question is not whether you are going to go to university.
The question is what.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants leaving secondary school or are pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands accessing university education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" Gradúa at the university, a remarkable achievement given that many of their parents immigrants, primarily Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finish secondary school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's labor force.
Those who look to the higher performance say they often have a natural affinity for the school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But the mentoring programmes can also play a unique role to help Graciela and millions of children like her to go to university, particularly if the efforts stand at the time.
Watching children of low-income, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time is not going to solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined to students.
We have to think about providing a support network for these children, from the garden of up to secondary school.

The Iraqi ministry of oil reached agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns about the violence and political instability, the Iraqi government was able to attract major oil companies to rebuild their fragile infrastructure, during two auction that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqi ministry of oil reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play a major role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are having Pujado in only two of the 10 sites.
Seven US companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only presented an offer lost.
Two US companies reached agreements to sites in June.
The poor representation of the oil giants Americans at the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asians and Europeans at the helm, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Forum of oil from Iraq, a centre of online news.
It will be a long time before something more is on offer in Iraq.
Concerns about security, for coordinated bombings mass on Tuesday, and the political instability while the American military are withdrawn, probably prevented American oil companies to risk more strongly in Iraq, which is the third most important reserve of crude oil in the world, said analysts.
US companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because the rivals, particularly Chinese and other energy companies controlled by the government, have labor costs significantly lower and are more prone to take risks because they do not answer to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
The main American firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have deepened ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years, empty-handed.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded over the weekend.
The national oil corporation, owned by the Chinese state, Ofertó in more contracts than any other company and achieved major investments in contracts for two major sites.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said the spokesman of the ministry of oil Assam Jihad.
We have confidence that the Chinese company will be on a par with its competitors and comply with its commitments to Iraq.
Companies to submit proposals made offers then with the subsidy per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production beyond current levels in each.
The chief planner of Al Qaeda was apparently murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that an alleged attack by US missile in Pakistan's border with Afghanistan has killed a principal planner of Al Qaeda operations this week, said Friday officials of the counter-terrorism Americans.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a senior terrorist leader this autumn.
Saleh Al-somalí was one of the two Arab men who are thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles against their car, near the town of watching Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to sources American and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said that the missiles were fired by an aircraft not identified, of the type operated by the CIA in the tribal area of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, in the direction of the Afghan border, when the car received the impact, said an official of the civilian intelligence agency of Pakistan, speaking by telephone from watching Shah.
The official said that local militants were rushed to the site and quickly seized what was left of the "completely wrecked bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two officials of the counter-terrorism Americans were cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
It described Somali as a military planner senior Al Qaeda, who led the terrorist group's operations outside of the region.
Was devoted to conspiring throughout the world, said a senior official, who spoke anonymously, citing the sensitive nature of American air strikes within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included Conspirativos attacks on the United States and Europe.
Had a strategic guide superior command of Al Qaeda and what resulted in operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second US official said that Somali had risen rapidly in the ranks of Al-Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a household name for some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat that came to us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of Al Qaeda or Taliban leader murdered since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other senior players.
The pace of attacks by aircraft not run by the CIA has declined since the summer, to an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a count by the long war journal, a Web site run by a non profit-making organisation.
The decrease is perhaps due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly to informants, said the site.
The maximum UN envoy in Kabul about to surrender
The UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that it would give up his post in March, ending a stormy mandate that was damaged by accusations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan's presidential election backed by the UN.
The departure of Eide happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the US timetable for military withdrawal that begins in 18 months to other NATO governments to withdraw its forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of the Afghan security forces and to send the right signal to the Afghans so that they can rely on the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The compromise has to be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants, work with Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase in the military sector needs to reflect in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said that he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, moving only two years in Kabul.
He said that wanted to notify the secretary
UN General Ban Ki-Moon, so I had time to find a replacement.
What I said is that it is better to start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I arrived here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun to look for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering to Staffan Di Mistura, a Sueco-italiano citizen who recently addressed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie, a Frenchman who previously addressed UN peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test before his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai in the presidential vote in the country and cover evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the charges, but said that the allegations of Galbraith, who was fired, "probably damaged the mission, because there was much scepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said that proposed the appointment of a civilian high representative to coordinate the efforts of assistance by the forces conducted by the United States in Afghanistan.
Also drove the leadership of the UN to allow his successor to hire more staff in the United States and other Western countries, which are provided to the Afghan mission, saying that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his frustration at the limits of their powers in Afghanistan, saying that the regulations cumbersome procurement UN undermine their ability to attract talent.
Such is the case that the rules of the UN allowed me to recruit only one person since May, said.
That is catastrophic and can not continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, said Friday that the world powers imposed soon "significant additional sanctions" against Iran for its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 troops in northern Iraq, during a trip to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, he dismissed the prospect of military action against the Islamic republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he argued, in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that I regret is that, if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, is the inherent unpredictability of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates said that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would be necessary to "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would be less safe with nuclear weapons", because "his people will suffer greatly" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from the White House, spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined with European leaders to warn that Iran will face consequences "credible" if its nuclear programme is not fully respects the recommendations of the UN Security Council and its nuclear inspection body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, indicated that it would negotiate on restricting its nuclear programme and would make a substantial part of its enriched uranium Reserve, in exchange for fuel that is desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two parties and buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have moved from the tentative agreements, in part, say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided on the possibility of engaging with the United States.
Frankly, I believe that the hardening of Iran with the international community on some proposals that actually agreed in early October, has joined the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set as the 31 December deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before other options, including continuing with what the minister for foreign affairs, Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called "devastating sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what he called the "unfounded accusations Thursday and without basis", on the part of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities, and said it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate solution, in the long term."
Gates, who was to return to Washington on Friday last, was found in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, before flying to Iraq's Kurdish region rich in oil, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the most Arab of Iraq, in particular with regard to the borders, the rights of ownership and participation.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to avoid any delay in the projects in the United States, to reduce the number of US troops from 115 000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to ease the Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. American officials the words of Gates to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan regional government, "their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
Do not abandon. "
In a China ageing, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by posters of propaganda that the Sermoneaban to the fact that "the mother earth is too tired to sustain more children" and "one more baby means one more tomb."
Learned the lesson so well that, when government officials from Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and ageing population of his town, changed course suddenly this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more of a child, his reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
There is nothing for a second, said Wang, of 31 years, a human resources manager with a child of 8 months.
More than 30 years after it was introduced the policy of a single child in China, creating two generations of children notoriously Rechonchos, children alone, Apodados "little emperors", a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen sharply to 1.8 children per couple, compared to the six of when the policy was effective, according to the division
demographic of the UN, while it is anticipated that the number of residents aged 60 and more of 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1% by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in the coastal cities rich with very educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 percent of the registered residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the family planning commission and municipal population in Shanghai, has said that fertile couples must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of aging people and alleviate a future labour shortages."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not so rich, however) as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
Written in the constitution of the country in 1978, the policy of a single son of China is perhaps the most controversial mandate introduced so far by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and job discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for his contribution to prevent a critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights activists have denounced abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced women pregnant with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have abortions, according to the sex of the unborn child, leading to a high Innatural proportion Varón-mujer.
In recent years, the demographic officials have gradually its position on the policy of only child.
In 2004, allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both the husband and the wife are children only in 2007, and many of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor of demographic research institute of the Beijing University, said that central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is only son.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Most of the morning, the cartels that families have only one child, were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be appropriate to have a second child and as apply for a permit.
The city government sent to family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slip leaflets under doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say that the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials of a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai that noted a moderate increase in applications for couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that, in spite of the campaign, even it is predicted that the number of births in the city in 2010 only reach around 165, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the municipality Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason for many people do not want more children.
They want to give the best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, for 27 years, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally entitled to do so.
But like many Chinese, have only health insurance and life insufficient provided by the government.
Without a network of social protection, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West sees incorrectly policy son only as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant the first child for the couple.
Yes, we are stealing the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
Is the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the manager of human resources, said he wants a single child because she so was: "the centre of our family and we were accustomed to all of us.
We are not used to take care of others and really do not want to take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained in a more forceful.
For parents with two careers, middle-class, reducing the birth rate, he said, is to have enough success to be selfish.
The people of between 20 and 30 years grew up watching the fight of their parents during the first days of China's experiment with capitalism and do not want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires parental long time, he argued.
A mother has to give up at least two years of their social life.
Then there are issues of space, "have to reshape their apartment", and the strategic "must have a curriculum prepared for the best childcare when the child is 9 months."
Most of their friends are prepared to deal with this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
A group of UN outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The climate conference sponsored by the UN, characterised so far by offensive positions and mutual recriminations, a renewed focus on Friday with the disclosure of a document that provides for ambitious cuts in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations to carry on their shoulders the bulk of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in the negotiations, which is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders come to Copenhagen next week.
Prepared by an ad hoc working group of the UN, the text does not talk about how much money he would provide rich to the poor countries to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for the key questions, including how the developed economies and major emerging economies Recortarían its coal production, and what would be the limit of the global rise in temperature that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, high in Washington representative for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six - page document, summed up a negotiating text of 180 pages to concentrate on what the maximum change official of the UN, Yvo of Bóer, described as "the big picture."
Sample profiles for a possible agreement, in which the industrialized nations Recortarían collectively their emissions by 2020 by between 25 and 45 per cent, compared with 1990 levels, while the main developing countries would reduce theirs during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Together, the countries Recortarían emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged the talks on Friday, promising to provide millions of dollars annually for the next three years, to help poorer countries to adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
However, on Friday was presented the same sort of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks last week.
The envoy change special United States, Stern, rejected claims that call for mandatory cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases for industrialized countries, compared with volunteers from the major emerging economies, if they were funded by the developed world.
The manoeuvre indicated that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China, with regard to what they did officials of the Bush administration just two years ago.
The United States is not going to do a deal without the biggest developing countries move forward and take steps, said Stern, who also expressed regret that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the deputy minister of foreign affairs Chinese I Yafei, described the negotiating maximum change in the United States lacked "common sense" or was "very irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the US would help China economically to deal with global warming.
With future economic record of the world's major powers at stake, the fault lines have eruption both within the developing world, as the world between industrial and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies as to save the planet, with China and the United States to face on their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the 24 most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are arguing about who should pay the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even if vulnerable countries have become more aggressive contain searching for the major emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where is developing a new economic hegemony, argued Ulate, who also works as regional adviser on climate change for Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the key participants say that the talks will be at best a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states, which has 43 members, drafted a motion for a preliminary treaty of 24 pages later in the morning of Friday.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who is leading international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the thrust of the small island nations has "political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now unified and require action by emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as the delegates are focusing on the fact that they have resolved most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government come to close a deal.
High-level officials, as the Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese deputy minister, fell from the aircraft and ran towards the corridors of the beautiful center, to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, in order to define the claims that during the next week.
The absolute disarray of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people come in and out of the convention centre, the activists touch the guitarra presented night mockery of the countries that they are being sold, and spend preliminary proposals of hand in hand rather than via mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only built: almost all key ministers are here at the moment, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice-president for global policy of Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
The first train to 225 kmh Britain redefines that sentiment Monday
The 5.13 on Monday morning, a Perforará darkness to point a way out of train that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The first train high-speed intercity the country will reach 225 kmh, when as a bolt from Ashford, Kent, to the stationst Panrcas in London, covering 93 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the transport secretary, then the lady Kelly Holmes, on board the first intercity service javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service linking Britain to an international network of fast trains, reliable and linking large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, the times of travel of business and the change of aircraft and cars to rail would reduce domestic emissions of coal, as well as Aliviarían congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still the high-speed lines in Britain.
High speed two (HS 2), a company created in January to provide the government a feasibility study, will deliver his report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
This will provide a detailed itinerary for the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a radius of five metres in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be fleshed out within a radius of 25 metres of a final route.
Also expected to HS 2 set out three options for a broader high-speed network turn to the North.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The favoured option is being proposed is a shape with how and in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would split in or near Birmingham, with a branch that is heading to the West from the Peninos to Manchester and Scotland, and the other towards the north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would come to Scotland.
It seems that this will be the most beneficial option, "said a member of the railways.
Once completed, journey times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first tranche, not before 2025, would allow passengers travelling between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with the little more than an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel to 402 kmh, turning the British network in Europe's fastest.
The initial route is being constructed to withstand trains 400 Mt in length, capable of transporting people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour in a line of Londres-birmingham.
This means that it would need a terminal of London capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the restrictions of space of the capital, is expected to extend an existing station to conform to the high-speed network.
The railway industry experts argue that only the station St Pancras International or Euston offer that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes that the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that there will not be a final decision until after a general election.
Even if the work is in place, the network would have to be built in sections.
At the beginning it would force the trains to stop the rapid lines by existing lanes north of Birmingham, maintaining journey times between London and Scotland over the three hours.
This is regarded as the crucial point needed to ensure a change of planes to trains, a point of reference for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers are faced with the mortgage by a £75.000 Naranjal of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the conservative party, he claimed the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of a Naranjal that built the home in his constituency.

Late payments: disgust among the guards in prison, is expected to take actions
The unions for prison guards called on Friday for a "general mobilisation" to demand the payment before the new year celebrations, premiums and the overtime, which was postponed until Eneropor budgetary reasons.
The force prison (2 trade union of guards) asked the staff out of service to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning off the prisons and'' to denounce the theft of their assets.

The US president, Barack Obama, who Festejará their first Christmas as a family in the White House, confessed to the famous TV presenter, Oprah Winfrey, which came to a simple conclusion about gifts: "I best gifts that I get."

The association UDF closed the tone and warns the new centre on the use of the acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the modem () Democratic Movement of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempt by the president of the new centre, Hervé Morin, to launch a takeover bid (takeover bid) on the acronym of the former party Giscardista, Intimándole to withdraw all support, on pain of being in demand.
Hervé Morin publicly announced its intention to restore the acronym UDF, as it considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political legacy after have stretched out a hand to the left.
On the other hand, the defence minister, whose party is linked to the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy the Saturday before the National Council of.
As support for its management, received the support of the member Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current Ncas) who claims ownership of the brand, it was the first in at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou that they do not want to be deprived of this, broke the silence to launch a formal notice to the minister and the member Intimándolos to renounce the acronym and property rights of the brand, on pain of legal proceedings.
In recent days, you have made many statements suggesting that they were going to propose to his political movement to restore the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and de Sarnez the modem, as Senator Jean Athuis of the centrist Alliance.
Also believe right to continue with the use of the name of the movement, the + focus +, and the slogan + L' UDF d'aujourd'hui + in its militant material and presentation on page of its site, argue the signatories of the letter.
As you know, have no right to use the acronym, explains the office of the UDF demanding that the "immediately withdraw the mention of the name of the UDF all support, as of (its) Internet site".
Also calls on Hervé de Charette "that transferred ownership of (the) marks the legitimate".
Failing that, will use the law to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, warning the signatories.
In the letter, require that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and remember that Morin and his friends' chose' leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had done in 2002 to create the UMP."
The new centre, according to them, has no right to use the acronym UDF.
Also remember that the last Congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the modem for three years and the creation of an office responsible for defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d' Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, continuing the office, "when they saw the brand", was "not a member of the UDF for some three years", but of the UMP.
Taking advantage of a scandalous and fraudulent the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to carry on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming crime, before a mockery of the strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, is more worthy his own name to try to get out of anonymity taking a fraudulent a name that is not right".

On Friday, while the court considered the origin of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-meyers, the allegations of lawyers were, in some cases, a large family confession.
In this way, the lawyer Liliane Bettencourt took into account three letters that his client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary in which he said that the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-meyers.
In the letter 2003, Liliane Bettencourt Agregaba, according to the lawyer, "could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for 15 years.
Since their wedding, never again, I was able to speak again with Françoise ".
For its part, the prosecutor in Nanterre, once again, that the complainant was unable to appear, especially since a judge refused, in recent days, to do all in their request to open a process of judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has the ability to appear before justice, not under supervision and has no tutor.
No other person can appear in its place, "said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie-chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that once made the trial on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-meyers.
Does managerial revolution or order of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of big French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence have been in vain
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the leadership of big companies on their employees recalls the position of the companies on consumers before the revolution of marketing: it is that the staff adhere to "values" certain from above as soon as it was imposing consumers products designed for the technical factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution gave instead to the strategies of conquest of the markets ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that have no relation to the factors of customer preference is repeated regularly.
A demobilisation of employees can end in a deadly.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilisation commits a serious development of all the intellectual functions of the company, particularly in research and development and, even more, of the intelligence business.
In fact, the (business intelligence) "demands that all the parties involved (...) have a proactive conduct and a prospective vision"; it needs by employees a commitment that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian direction.
For that reason, we invited a managerial revolution, which would bring the staff at the centre of the concerns of the company as well as the customer.
Domestic opinion polls have relative utility
Does the internal opinion polls, as the questionnaire carried out by orange among its employees, to the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, fear not.
- In principle, because I was able to verify that, faced with a new situation, and after many twists and turns, all companies end up doing essentially ... what we always did! B +
- secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, is growing in proportion to the importance of their own failures.
- finally, because the majority of managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As come from large schools of Engineers, interpreted the psychology of way.
Take, for intellectual comfort, the former theory that the "American" Reactivaron recently, and that the studies institutes and the media largely behind their backs.
In this way, to suggest that it is possible to handle the "commandos" (sic) of the commitment of the executive, a recent research by Ipsos published in Le Figaro. Fr reaffirms the managers in a position of management, unsuited to today's world.
Identifying and measuring the factors of mobilisation
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, is taking a practical view of human behavior.
Is to integrate in any reasoning or practice of business management, a basic fact: for employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to make part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from analysis Motifuncional take this concept of the motivations of employees.
The studies showed that they judge their company on the basis of a DOXA that allows them, through their image of the company, evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own projects of life.
Thanks to identifying and measuring the factors of mobilisation, business managers can monitor, forecast and anticipate its "social" performance and relocate the management Derecursos human "in the place".
In this way, create a favourable ground for the development of a business intelligence strong and effective.
Oslo speech: the "just war" Obama receives praise from the right
On Friday, the American right, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has championed the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, hailed the speech that Obama had spoken out on Thursday.
The conservatives, who had discredited the award of the prize to Obama on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, the former candidate for vice-president in the election of 2008.
I loved what he said, declared Mrs Palin, is chief of the right wing of the Republican Party to the newspaper USA Today, and added that she herself had raised the issue of the war "sometimes necessary" in his memoirs published recently.
In my opinion, the war is, of course, the last thing the Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists, he observed.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and in Afghanistan, was spent, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain their decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, found that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very well, the former chairman of the House of Representatives, which appreciated in particular the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
At times, the speech I was very historic, said Gingrich, during an interview on the radio programme' The takeaway ".
The former elected representative, which some see as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to hear "a left-wing president" when reminded the members of the Nobel committee "that they would not be free nor could deliver a prize for peace if the use of force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, author of the speeches of George W. Bush and current Cronista in the Washington Post, Obama made "a very American speech".
In addition to stand as a "citizen of the world", as it always does, "" spoke as an American president "to remind the Europeans" living in a bubble of security that they did not create and do not do much to preserve it, "said Gerson.
Among the few right-wing not very convinced, a hawk in the Bush era, the former ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, called the speech "monotonous, pretentious and lacking in inspiration" on the Internet site National Review Online.
To the left of the president, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
However, the press centre left praised the president.
Los Angeles time, although it continues to believe that Obama was awarded the prize prematurely, called the speech "overproduction" especially for a speaker who is known for his talent.
The speech Oslo "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," commented the Californian newspaper.
Obama "made the speech that was necessary," estimated the New York Times, "at the same time of bleak and edifying."
Transport Carretero: three Maratónicas negotiations to ensure the supply of Christmas
After three sessions of negotiations Maratónicas, the industry's trade unions of roads and the TLF (transport and logistics of France), the only organisation employers who remained until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon to an agreement that puts an end to the strike and the threat that falls on the supply of Christmas.
During the session of signatures on the evening of Friday, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, "was pleased" with the agreement, after several sessions of negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators were dismissed at dawn on Friday, hoping to quickly sign the text agreed at the eleventh hour of the morning.
Although three employers' organisations (Fntr, UNOSTRA, Otre) withdrew giving a door.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 H was necessary to reach an agreement and the text is signed at 18 H.
The conflict "would have been very damaging for business" and "it was feared that disrupt the new year celebrations", said Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase of 4% for the lowest salaries (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest international (transport).
The fare per hour of 8,72 euros 9,06 for low wages.
It is not much, but we start with great disadvantage, explained Patrice (FO).
If so, we are going to give the order to our militants that there will be no more cuts or blockages in the centres of supply.
But there can always be some rogue, added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that it is "a good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant increases to the high salaries bearing in mind international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense and that respects employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) acknowledged as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel expenses of 3% and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will mainly address the issue of extraordinary pay and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau reiterated that "a low of 100 million euros in charges employers' was the subject of an amendment to the government in the draft law of finances correction for 2009, the National Assembly voted Thursday night.
The government will request to the Senate that the vote "under the same terms".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to be implemented, first of all, companies this organisation and, secondly, to the entire profession, if the minister of work do an extension.
It will be done "as quickly as possible," assured Bussereau.
Opposition from employers' organisations could only delay the process.
The Fntr denounced that it was a "business of naive", as the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax."
The secretary of state for transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as conclusion to an analysis by the parties, but not to those who want to eat in the next Christmas Eve dinner, regretted the UNOSTRA.
For the Otre, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months."
A: conflicts over the weekend, unions with the proposals of the
The conflicts in the line of public transport largest city in France, will continue over the weekend, because at the meeting on Friday, 2 nd day of strike between unions and the management of the RATP, there was no agreement and the trade unions were dissatisfied with regard to his request for premium.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, Saturday and Sunday only trains between 10 H and 20 H, at a rate of one every two train in the central section (between and nation) and a train in four in the other lines.
The interconnection with the Snfc will be suspended in Nanterre, which will force passengers to change train.
The Galleries Lafayette, who expect 200,000 customers every day, were happy "the RATP strive to provide service to large shops".
The inexcusable to cross from west to east the city.
The route runs through from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre until Boissy-saint-léger and Marne-la-vallée.
On Friday, roughly one in two trains at peak hours, and almost no train in hours Valley, as had been planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder in the platforms thanks to the Organisation of the inhabitants of the island from France.
In this way, the Alba, the station Saint-Germain-en-Laye () was much less full than normal, especially for the absence of students.
In Boissy-saint-léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer of 29 years, explained that it had lifted "an hour and a half later to reach timetable".
The station Saint-Lazare not, indicated the SNCF, which had provided for the supervision of police and forces of order.
Those to which the SNCF operates from Cergy-le-haut or bound for it arrived or the station Saint-Lazare to join the meters.
New general assemblies of workers on strike will take place on Saturday and Sunday. Will be analysed the results, "unsatisfactory" according to the trade unions, a meeting that took place with the direction on Friday afternoon.
The director of the proposed negotiating a specific protocol in all aspects for the to: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what they want drivers who are demanding a premium due to them, according to Thierry Garon (SUD).
The RATP puts even brackets their proposals premium, commented outraged the CGT, noting that the leadership "was not able to resolve a problem that the SNCF and roads had already resolved".
It provides for a new meeting on Monday to make "a more detailed analysis of the conditions for the exercise of the profession", the RATP.
What also led to the unions to say that the company "does not imported users of the weekend".
In the morning, some 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters, in Paris.
Then the direction, which refused until then to talk during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could spread to the B on Tuesday, after the UNSA and indépendants have submitted a notice.
The unions are demanding a premium of 120 euros (UNSA) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, indépendants) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions in this line with a million passengers daily.
The drivers, all in the second degree of his career, charge of EUR 2.7 gross and 600 to 650 euros of materials, for hours with shifts Alternados, Sundays and days.
The Turkish justice dissolving the party, a decision with serious consequences
Turkey's constitutional court ruled on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the main party in the country, a decision that immediately provoked demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could complicate the task of the government, which has just lend a helping hand to the Kurdish community trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "focal point of activities that the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," he declared to the press, the president of the court, Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, though only a majority was needed seven votes to get the dissolution, indicated Kiliç, and added that 37 of the party leaders, including that of its President Ahmet Türk and she Aysel Tugluk, are paragraphs of political life for five years.
Also, the judge announced the resignation of parliamentary immunity which enjoyed Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the assets of the party by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in parliament (550).
Their leaders warned before the verdict that members of parliament before being parliamentarians without partisan label.
The decision comes in the wake of a procedure that launched the Supreme Court prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, which accused the DTP of obey the "principles" of the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK), considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and by many more countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party claims it has no "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to describe it as a terrorist organization and called on the government to negotiate with him.
The court's verdict comes at a time when the government has fallen into a hand to the Kurdish community Proponiéndole a series of measures to strengthen their rights, for which the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP claimed that a break-up could lead to an escalation of tensions in the south-east Anatolio, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader, Abdullah, degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of Justice, thousands of demonstrators gathered in the face of the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the great southeast populated mostly by Kurds.
The police threw grenades and used water cannons, while protesters throwing Molotov bombs or stones with deep.
In Istanbul, also focused 100 people or so.
After the verdict, said that the decision of Justice would "deepen the despondency".
Turkey can not solve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) dissolving a party, told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle we are opposed to the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, said the minister of energy, Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotting the opening Democratic launched by the government, said the political analyst Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, it added.
On Thursday, the PKK has won an attack which killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks of the past few months.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, was regarded as a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenogrado, one of the 10 districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily Custodiado for research secret weapons.
Today, the community of inhabitants, situated 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is regarded as the "Silicon Valley".
Here are important centres of research and production of micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogrado have contacted the seat of scientific Riedberg in Frankfurt, with university institutes and companies in the center of innovation in Frankfurt (FIZ).
There were a number of mutual visits and now, on Wednesday, Selenogrado and in Frankfurt Riedberg signed a "protocol of close collaboration".
The Vice-alcalde Juri Rosljak and the mayor of Selengrado, Anatoly Smirnov, led the Russian delegation; Frankfurt signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In the 2010 travel to a seminar in Selenogrado Fiz representatives and managers of small and medium-sized enterprises of natural sciences research centre.
Scientific Exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
The Fiz companies will be able to put one foot in the growing Russian market.
In exchange businesses Russian scientific want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the headquarters of major companies and research institutes Russians.
These include, for example, the Institute of electronic technology, the large corporations Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "City of socialist planning" for weapons research.
Selenogrado (translated literally as "green city") received its name from the landscape of mountains, which settled research facilities.
Brakes in Stuttgart
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 does not placed sufficiently high.
For supporters of the project is purely and simply of "the new heart of Europe".
The law so. S 21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which the capital of the region of Banden-württemberga a decade of chaos of construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged the spirit of the 1980s.
With terminals, which end up in the middle of the city, were considered at the time of the 19th century engineering, acting as brakes of a modern rail traffic, formerly an enormous amount of time was needed for locomotives back ahead.
Rolling, stopped in their tracks continue the journey, but how it should be done.
And why should disappear terminals: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a step station, which is roughly half the journey of the lines of operation networks between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, hence the slogan of "heart of Europe".
The S 21 really will be launched, in spite of the fact that the visions of the 1980s no longer be compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the capitals Hessiana and Bavarian is almost unpayable implement the reduction.
Rail terminals of course nor have more problems of entry and departure, since there are locomotives reversible with Tractora unity and cart driver at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new tranche built towards Ulm will already launched.
Federal politicians and communal have prepared as well.
The rail continues, because the risks of the great individual infrastructure projects of the Republic leads the taxpayer, not the rule.
From the point of view, the project still justified up to a point.
It creates new urban area, many green areas, probably of the graphic generated by computer's designer.
For the rail system S 21 is harmful.
The station step and the anchor road are designed for the transport of persons, which it attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
Then there was the competition from low-cost flights.
But the modern transport policy must first deal with strengthening the transport of goods, as the transport in rail is considerably greener than the done by lorries on the roads.
However, the new sections in construction are good for freight trains due to the intense.
Even more serious is that the S 21 also indirectly affects many other rail projects.
More than six billion euros should be buried in.
That is the official figure.
Experts believe it is more realistic to between 10 and 15 billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money in other crossings and passages narrow in the network.
A total of 60 projects higher on the list of the ministry of transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometres long through the Valley of the Rhine.
Since 1987 the route is built to slowly.
We urgently need here moved up a gear as it should.
However the S 21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the neck of bottle for international transport of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The government is considering the judgment on the airport.
The federal government is pending in the autonomous parliament in Wiesbaden, whether it will submit an appeal of appeal to the ruling on the ban on night flights of the administrative court of Hesse.
The coalition of CDU / FDP appears to have commissioned experts legal research of the judgment of the Vgh, of more than 400 pages, he said the finance minister, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had founded in writing on this date, which in the case of the construction of the runway on landing north-west planned at Frankfurt airport, the federal state would have to regulate again the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as provided for in the federal government, it would not be incompatible with the mandatory legal protection of the population of the noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until 4 January, if it is going to present the appeal of appeal against the judgment.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressed the representatives of the government to the use of appeal to the nation's administrative court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to honour their promises to ban air traffic at night, that had been made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of floor.
It is quite difficult, if you leave keep his word, said the head of the greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We kept our word."
The minister Posch rejected the recrimination of Schäfer-gümbel, that the government would be trying through distortions of the law and tricks still get their night flights.
A comprehensive legal research would need some time.
The coalition did not want to act on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a decision legally, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
And what represents the opposition, never would have been claims his group about the ban air traffic at night.
Banks in the US. Back aid.
The big American banks buffeted by the crisis of its state shackles.
"Bank of America" returned once the aid that it had given the banking rescue fund for a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros).
And the group Citi plans to repay state aid, according to a report by the CNBC United States.
With this the institutes aim to break free of the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the restriction on the payment of the bonus to managers, as well as the payment of high rates.
"Bank of America" had managed approximately 19 billion of liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had enough resources, including by the sale of items.
The banking director Kenneth Lewis welcomed on Wednesday night especially to American taxpayers: financial injection helped overcome very difficult.
The banking house had miscalculated the effort of the absorption of the investment bank at the height of the financial crisis.
The group also Citi aims to get money in the capital market in order to free itself from its obligations to the state.
The CNBC reported source of known circles, that the American bank could announce as early as this Thursday increased its capital by 20 billion dollars.
A representative of the group Citi declined to comment.
In June had already returned their aid Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.
Election
In the end everything was faster than was thought.
Barely two weeks after the council's administrative (channel ZDF German television) the head of wording Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can submit to a successor.
Yesterday evening the body intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the study Principaldel in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this from the station, officially for not anticipate the procedure.
But it also influenced the no harm more to the ZDF director Markus Schächter, if this proposal does not approve in the administrative council.
Frey, the candidate of Schächter, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the body.
The outcome of the vote was not yet specified the closure of drafting this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the administrative council with its proposal to renew for another five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven states supported Brender, seven voted against him. The dismissal of Brender was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
For most of the Union in the administrative council already weeks before the election had indicated that they would not agree to Brender in his post.
The opposition against the head of wording had been organised by the prime minister of Hesse, the MR. Roland Koch.
Declined another term of office of the head of wording prestigious arguing that under the leadership of Brender the ZDF information would have lost rates hearing.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which Flageló political influence on the ZDF.
In the end until it had been interfering in the debate 35 specialists in public law, which described the act as unconstitutional.
But nothing served.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
Studied politics, education and Romanesque.
Later he worked at the station "Südwestfunk" and in the newspaper "Frankfurter".
In 1983 was changed to the ZDF, in principle "Heute-journal."
Following stations: 1988 until 1990 rapporteur staff of the head of wording; correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and driver of the programme "Morgenmagazins; until the 2001 director of the foreign policy; since then director of the study in the capital.
The political party of the greens announced a constitutional demand after the dismissal of Brender, which was elected this Wednesday as journalist of the year by the magazine of media "Magazin".
Instead of Koch in the administrative council, the president of the government of Rhineland-Palatinate, explained last week that the federal states should change the state convention of the ZDF in such a way, that the proposals of staff of the director can not be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of political supporters of the control was ruled out by Beck.
The likely successor to Brender, Mr Peter Frey, was recommended to the administrative council with a smart move: criticised heavily to the body by the dismissal of Brender.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence both Schächter what could appoint to the post of head of wording without losing face, as the administrative council what could vote, without being under suspicion of giving the post to a supporter.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is allocated anyway to left-wing Democrats.
Curricula are
partial success for students: After a year of strikes relating to education, the ministers of education and culture of the Federated States finally caved. At a meeting of the ministers of education and culture with guiding University, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of bachelor and Masters.
Students in a future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: Basically every module of the race to finish with a single test.
In addition to examine the burden on students, and we want to ensure a "real measure and justifiable."
The policy and universities want to simplify the recognition of results of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
The Federated States are committed to draw up a more flexible structural rules together to racing bachelor and Masters.
Regulations of the federal states which differ from this, it should not exist.
Less
Since the start of the student protests in June the ministers of education and culture and the guiding universities constantly talk about the improvement to be able to deliver and conclude with a career (Estudiabilidad).
Now for the first time there was talk of a particular content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module ends with a single examination," says in a 30 - page document, which aims to regulate the approval of curricula.
With the "sensitive reduction in the burden of examinations" is intended to prevent the development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the Estudiabilidad, explained the director of the accreditation council, Mr Reinhold.
Moreover, in the future, the "Estudiabilidad" should be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and content must be examined in detail on unnecessary restrictions of students in the election.
The courses.
Students would have "the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage its own initiative".
These rules Valdrían for new careers, but also in the examination of existing careers.
These must be "Reacreditar" once every five years, but this would mean that it would take until 2015 to examine all the careers.
Those responsible for this would be at the level of the whole country 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which was installed by the Länder.
The ministers of education and culture Exhortaron to the federal states in October so influence the agencies, the amount of raw and examinations are not too rigorous or challenging.
In some Länder universities and technical schools already reached agreement with the ministries to take such measures.
So far only Renania-platinada assured provide additional resources for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money universities must implement mentoring programs and student advice, as well as strengthen offices of examinations and from outside.
The federal state and the universities aim to have 10 million for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring to parliament a novel of university law.
As it should be enough for one examination for the completion of a model of race.
The shape of the race should become more flexible, also wants to ensure the recognition of assessments in other universities and facilitate the accessibility to the Masters.
Until the end of next year is intended to examine all about their careers "Estudiabilidad."
On Thursday the government and the opposition discussed again on the conditions of study at the federal state.
Apart from the praise There was also criticism about the decisions.
In the board at the federal level of university groups Juso (Young Socialists) Seexigía, that the configuration of the education policy is no longer should be "behind closed doors" of ministers and university guiding.
At the latest in the wake of the strikes of education, students now as main involved should also have its say.
The president of the board of guiding University (Hrk), Margret Wintermantel, gave his support to the students: "We need the experience of the students," he said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of education, with which the Hrk on a joint document for reform.
For the Trade Union of education and science (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not quite enough: the trade union demands a legal right for each student under the title of bachelor access to a career of later.
The Federated States must ensure that for the current generation of students from bachelor there are enough seats in a future study for the best position to study possible. It reported a member of the GEW, Mr Andreas Keller.
The Federated States have Quecontratar many more teachers.
But on greater access to the Masters, the ministers of education did not comment.
More than a note at the bottom about Herta Müller
"come and go in Germany is virtually no control," reads the first line of a poem by Werner Söllner in fragments of language, in which Tematiza experiences of arrival in Germany for a dissident, who won his freedom, but lost the environment of the language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked initially as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest, and later as reader in an editorial of childrens books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
To Söllner gave several prizes for literature, in 1993 the memorable lessons or talks of poetry in Frankfurt at the Goethe University, and in 2002 is director of the Forum for literature in Hesse in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Given that speak quite on Tuesday during a meeting in Munich on "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror disfigured their dossiers"
visibly unsafe and ashamed, Söllner read out a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian secret service against fellow writers Alemanes-rumanos, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the prize German language.
Attempts to recruitment had started slowly, in early 1971.
"Therefore I am someone who not sufficiently defended against attempts to provocation of fear of the Securitate", ended Söllner.
The Werner Söllner is Im Walter.
Almost at the same time of the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Müller and his literary controversy without equal with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, shaking the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors of Romania for a case that exposed the chasms and the evil of a political system, which is based in control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, by what is known so far, is not just a perpetrator but a victim.
In his dossier of IM Walter had played a role, said the scientist literary Michael following the confession of Söllner, and stressed the influence for him positive Delim Walter.
What had apologised or defended on every point difficult for him, he said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
The statement Söllner in this way and public face of this was unexpected, the confession of a Ex-disidente and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, surprised not so much.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for spies of the Securitate-spitzel Gewesen, wrote Herta Müller already in July in the weekly "Zeit, having read his own dossier of pages.
Those involved have surely speculation and will know in some cases, which names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also of Walter.
Unlike the review of the files Stasi with a controlled procedure in Germany, dealing with the issues of control by the Securitate is still quite vague.
A systematic clarification was boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the Palestinian Birthler, was formed in 1999, and the handover of the files since then is more.
Since 2005, there is a law governing the administration of the files.
An interview after the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Müller, evidence of the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite big. In this interview a Ex-jefe of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke disparagingly of the Condecorada.
"She is psychosis," in the end only once.
The infamy of power seemed to show no rounds in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the case Söllner, as so often when there is blame.
Why right now? who caused damage? The reaction of the listeners off the confession of Söllner leaves hope that the continuation of this story will govern more by the desire for knowledge and not so much by the award of blame and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for literature, is more than just a note at the bottom.
The Champions League as to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the football team VfB in Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by a plastic bag of orange colour of the supplier of his team, took a taxi Mercedes class C a quarter of an hour after midnight, gave the impression that a member of the foreign service elegantly dressed was emerging from a very nice celebration of Christmas, in which the sports goods manufacturer had distributed samples.
The man in the feature had hired a driver, because we still do not know the city.
Moreover, it would also have been able to drive the car himself: at the end of the day, there was no alcohol involved, and neither was joy man of 55 years.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow would start work again.
Or would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: "It is true that we reached the final of", namely in the Champions League, thanks to the triumph 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, but we can not be blinded by the success: We will have to fight the decline brutally. "
"Much more important task they expected the next Sunday, he said.
Then, we will have to repeat the success of the real class "in the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have clearly shown again, after the three quick goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).

The final of the Champions League (Ida parties of the 16/17 and 23/24 February / parties back and 16/17 March) Sortearán in Nyon on 18 December.
So remained limited the joy at the entrance of Babbel successor.
Not only in the alleged savior, that in the short time they had been inspired the bewildered Profis of Stuttgart confidence in themselves, willing to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and I told them that they had to concentrate on its strengths, I urged to be more fired, explained the of souls gross its recipe for success as simple as that sounds, but that with the Babbel had not already had an effect.
He deployed a certain magic, accepted the favour of Babbel, Jens Lehmann, when in football comes a new impetus, there are sometimes things that they would never have believed possible. "
And Sami Khedira, that after a lull of several weeks due to an injury advanced quickly to become the best player local thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the phenomenon "with the proverbial Wind" and the way we work of the new leader: he is a man who speaks in depth, and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
And that is what was missing, of course, when I was Babbel.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns the sporting manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all on record.
As Gross, also the players and the manager abstained from overstate the triumph against a defence weakened by lack of and totally of Romanian guests.
It had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0: 4 had come the sad wake up, gave think Khedira.
And the manager Horst Heldt warned that although it had reached a goal of the season, the other was still very far.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt did not want to celebrate his birthday number 40, even after the first victory in his headquarters for some three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated in the form of a TV interview, passed just before the start of the game, which had granted the doorman Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions taken by others, and not Jens, faced Heldt the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had reproached weakness in the direction of the board, which had decided to change of coach by the pressure of the fanatics teenagers.
Also had removed their free day after the games called Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
The statements of Lehmann were marked by the pure selfishness ", Heldt, and announced consequences for the Zaguero.
Probably no longer be friends forever, the two Cuarentones.
But at least agreed on all the others that, without previous efforts with the team's coach replaced, would not have been possible the spectacle of great strength of the game and of battle.
Babbel and their assistants had an important part in the success, "said Heldt and Lehmann unison; and was also the man in the suitcase of plastic.
The world championship of heavyweights
ardent mourning in Berne: Time and again the Kevin Johnsonn was leading the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title of heavyweight in the WBC version.
The trial of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The champion of 38 years in the version of the partnership WBC expired in the night from Friday to Saturday in Berne the American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).
For Klitschko was his third successful defence of the title since her return in October 2008.
Earlier, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to make the Noqueo that everyone had hoped for.
Klitschko expanded its balance sheet to 39 triumphs in 41 professional fights, twice had to be overcome because of their injuries.
The Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his row number 24.
With a few 17000 spectators in the sand of Berne, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimetres lower, before the mourning had proclaimed the end of the era Klitschko, was again and again from the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not bring a decisive contribution to its target dangerous.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little to one, and just tried to move the rounds.
While he was leading to Klitschko with words and gestures, their blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second, after Hoffmann in 2000, 12 rounds complete with Klitschko.
Before the fight, had already been true scandal in the Swiss capital.
Had insulted Klitschko as horrible zombie ", it does not do anything."
To make the weight, the champion was left on Friday to take to Johnson the sun glasses of the nose to be able to see their eyes. "
Fourth triumph following the return of Klitschko
Also in its fourth row after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of nearly four years, expired at the time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had "recovered their" belts of the WBC, who previously had to surrender without a fight.
That year expired later in their defense of the title to Juan Carlos Gomez, Cuba, and in September to Chris Arreola, of the United States.
In this fight only received a blow, and I am in very good physical condition, had explained Klitschko their rapid return to the ring.
But his dream is still collect all four major titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after it Destronó in November to Nikolai Valujev, of 2.13 metres of stature.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes is already planning the fight against Klitschko in the stadium, Wembley, London.
The case Kunduz
Full frontal attack on the opposition: The head of the Group of the greens, Jürgen Trittin, called liar by the minister of defence, because of false information on the matter Kunduz.
The SPD and the leftist require explanation to the chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin following the most recent revelations about the air strike in Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the minister of defence, Karl-Theodor zu (CSU), have cheated with knowledge of the facts.
In issuing News'' on Saturday, transmitted by the television channel ARD, the head of the Group of the greens, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister had not told the truth "about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, usually says: he told lies.
The order to kill would have given without taking into account the rules of the international force protection for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that had NATO, and that has been read by Mr Gutenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, was made known that in this attack was not only destroy trucks kidnapped, but also to kill two Taliban leaders.
In the air attack in the United States, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the report of the investigation into NATO, died or were injured up to 142 people.
The Greens, the SPD and the left Exhortaron on Saturday to Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately to the federal parliament and to clarify what really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of intentional killing is part of the Afghanistan policy of the federal government, and if the chancellery, the army and the information service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Renate Künast.
The government's spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, decisively rejected the criticism.
The chancellery not exerted any influence on concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
Saturday also had transcended misgivings about the presentation made by the ministry on the reasons for the dismissal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information Spiegel, both had reported to correct and completely against the backdrop of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it was said that they had denied the existence of the reports of NATO and had concealed details sensitive to the minister.
However, from the environment of the two senior officials that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two - page document of Colonel Klein, who was at the helm, and a report of a patrol of the area.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have requested in a letter to clarify the matter, the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner".
So far it has not received a reply, it said.
The ministry has not said Saturday the accusations that he made, and pointed out that this is in the federal parliament's committee of inquiry, which will be next Wednesday.
Worlds Oníricos
In a state of vigil, some people see pictures and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts fade the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
While happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are Acostados in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can without hindrance to the more wild imaginations and creations of the imagination.
However, anyone who States similar to the dream during the vigil, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, is considered the most of the time in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as.
But such images and voices arise not only in the mentally ill or in.
The fault lies with our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes make Desdibujen the boundaries between the dream, the madness and the reality.
The states of consciousness alert modified Oníricamente can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call them visions, and at worst foolish.
Although it can distinguish the trigger and the effects, it can refer to processes such visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the experiences Psicodélicas of the prophet of the new era Carlos Castañeda, member of possession Chamánica, and the psychosis and hallucinations.
The hallucinations or delusions arise when Descarrillado the balance of substances neural of communication in the brain especially the dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline Acetilcolina and is clouded the interaction between different parts of the same.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very often appear hallucinations complex and thoughts.
The gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between madness and dream has occupied philosophers and doctors from the old era.
Aristotle envisaged the hallucinations as a form of dream in a state of vigil, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness with member Oníricos" to Sigmund Freud, the dream even was "a psychosis, with all the absurdities, formations Alocadas, and mirages of it".
It is the autumn of 2001, when T. becomes a figure of comic.
His body is in two dimensions and scandalously colourful.
The gravity no longer has power over him, is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red as blood, deformed, Rechinando teeth.
What are pursuing, with heavy boots and Flameantes, cast against the walls, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Voices shrill and malignant ringing from the walls and the radio.
It can not be, the voices to insult and offend.
T. two cables from the stereo, the Amarra to form a knot of hanged, and set in a hook in the ceiling.
It rises in a Bocina and put the noose around the neck.
Plain.
The rope was.
What you will serve as a lesson!, shouting voices in a chorus that the Tímpanos, sees the clinic and do you! "
Now, T. is 40 years old and has undergone six psychosis acute, the last two years ago, the first for nearly 20 years.
The reason that the place was LSD.
His diagnosis is psychosis Esquizo-afectiva-paranoide also is Maniaco-depresivo, takes drugs, against depression, mania and schizophrenia.
Has learned to live with their disease, for three years is married.
In the psychosis have experienced the most terrible distress and the deepest despair, he says.
The hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics are the deals as the second most common disease after the Depression.
In a schizophrenic psychosis acute, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the market, and they fall into a state of Sobreexcitación that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, disruptions in the relationship, or mania.
Especially widespread is the hearing voices: voices that give orders, or.
They are also frequent the hallucinations.
The question is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter out signals disruptive, awareness is being inundated with impressions.
As the dream, the psychosis opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deeper layers of awareness.
The perception of reality in the psychosis is focused on the subject, says professor Thomas, chief doctor of the clinic of General Psychiatry of the university hospital of Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the centre of events, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time entering a passive role, as in a dream, you feel overwhelmed by events and can not organise actively.
That is why the schizophrenic often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust the reality to them, the hallucinations are a cruel reality, the impossible.
Having experienced a Alucinación once in life
Unlike in a dream, he says, "spatial structure and sensory reality that are perceived in the psychosis remain in principle as it is."
The thoughts and hallucinations are based in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still an unknown why our brains do somersaults.
According to the member of exception can lead to any person to lose touch with reality provisionally.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
Apparently there is a genetic provision for schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that in addition to the genes there are also other factors.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer brain damage to a minimum.
We suspect that the maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, for example through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains.
But it remains unclear how is this alteration of the system, which in no way be seen for many years.
Also the influence of the environment plays an important role stress or a traumatic experience can be a psychosis when there is already a prior arrangement.
Similarly, the drugs can cause psychosis, because they interfere with the system transmitter in the brain.
When the brain heats up
What all this is that people Psicóticas suffer with their hallucinations and take medicines very expensive to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says professor in psychology Erich Kasten, of Lübeck.
The perceive a Alucinación as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten collects for ten years reports of hallucinations and visions and has analysed the results in the White die Irreale in unserem (the unreal world in our head), published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms of the psychosis, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
These include, in addition to mental disorders such as disorder limit of personality or depressions, often also diseases such as tablet, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and injuries Craneoencefálicos.
In a surprising and in certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are normally repressed.
Arise when the brain areas in which processed perceptions are Hiperactivas or are little; when our brains are hot, but also when there is a lack of incentives.
The drugs can cause this state in the same way that the brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, the stress, the evil of brain or other states of emergency.
In Jüngeren Studien gab BIS Zu Drittel der Befragten roll-call, Mindestens IM Leben Halluzination Erlebt Zu.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, lived in a small town in Western Pomerania and a college of secondary education.
An ordinary girl.
If it were not for these images and voices.
Sometimes, during the recreational, happens that a boy clumsy with long hair and dark I directed the floor.
When she replies, the other pupils the look Soprendidos; no one, in part of it, hear or see the boy.
They believe that the timid girl is a Ensoñadora a little strange, but Sarah K. knows that he is not dreaming.
Is wake up and see and hear that boy, in the same way that sees and hears the girl sitting in the bank next door.
Can even their presence felt, at least a few moments.
It is a nice feeling, likes the boy.
Sometimes wonders whether he is insane.
Also know that the boy and the rest of visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
The visions are often a burden.
When he is in class sometimes can not follow the lesson because professor in their eyes and ears is presenting a new colleague, while for the rest explains in a visible and audible the mathematical equations.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room to reach the dream, which often arrives late and is scarce, is not able to tell whether aroused or dreaming, if the images they see, the nose or the girl with cuts in arms and legs, appear with their eyes open or closed.
Leave me in peace, shouts them to the figures.
Their parents and friends told you nothing, that is insane.
Autumn of 2009. Sarah K. now has 20 years.
Approved last year selectivity and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago that the hallucinations have disappeared.
Since he has come into contact via the Internet with the psychologist Kasten, knows that he is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art by despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is isolated socially or suffers a restriction of stimulus, it is very likely that after a while start having hallucinations.
I think that the brain is Yse charged the same of entertainment.
Sarah K., daughter currency, was of little fear of the other children and often played alone.
Their hallucinations began when, with 13 years, he learned that the man he called father since has use of the reason is not their biological father.
Since the hallucinations visual and noise are active in the same areas of the brain that also processed real impressions and noise, those affected as Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between vision and reality. Every experience, "says Kasten, takes place in the brain, the reality is planned there.
The hallucinations are equally images which the brain produces, therefore look so real. "
Kasten also classifies the fantasies night as a way of Alucinación.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike the schizophrenic, people psychologically healthy are able to recognize their views as unrealistic.
Kasten recommends it to their patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Situation line between dream and Alucinación
In this world too focused on what aware, the experiences imaginary tend to generally Patologizarse, says Michael Schmidt-degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and medical clinic head of psychiatry and psychotherapy hospital Florence-nightingale-krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but that also implies something positive and creative madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-degenhard has investigated the so-called Oneirismo, a special form of awareness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
The hallucinations Oníricas almost dreams are very complex and detailed that the person that the experience feels real and then can not differentiate of being awake.
The member aware Oníricos arise in extreme situations related to a trauma or illness, for example in patients with Polirradiculoneuropatía, experiencing a paralysis remain completely aware. Die EIB Vollem Bewusstsein Motorische Lähmung Erleben.
According to Schmidt-degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of oneself or in the world due to an inability total and permanent, it replaces a real situation very dangerous for a world of their own and imaginary is decoupled from reality.
A form of situation line between dream and Alucinación.
As it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the actual situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive way to give meaning and interpretation to a situation in which our own ability to create allows us not in nothing of the loss of awareness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen, of Zurich, described their experiences Oníricas in his book Herzenwechsel as a rescue action of the soul.
Had 49 years ago, when his conscience embarked on trips of several days following an operation of the valves with transplants of heart included, while his body was doomed to immobility in the intensive care station.
Claussen are in a world created by the same and visited strange places in the past: was caved in bed, a greater man on board a Sanatorio on a train, a robot for his health.
We saw in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by noble who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorbike what kidnapped in their country of origin, made on his hospital bed in the Alps with snow Firn and was found with a Korean Mafia.
What gives all these facts imaginary, is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these journeys Interioresson fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a different state, described their experience.
On the contrary, the memories of the trips are mental, many years later, much more clear, even in the details irrelevant.
More intensive clear and even that real experiences.
The intensity of this experience the horizon of the rest of our everyday experience, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt-degenhard.
Finally, the Oneirismo, psychosis, hallucinations and consumption of narcotics show how fragile the internal reproduction of external reality, even when we are awake.
Every modification of the rule of conscience, sums up the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
Snow can come
Crude
The children take charge of the editorial with 27 years
The new editor Kallen has reached an interim solution: Hubert crude wants to leave your company in the future in the hands of his two children, spoke to Spiegel.
100% of the holding will be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg the publisher Hubert Gross sees his company in the hands of their children in the future.
The two children become heirs with 27 years and have committed to joining the company, confirmed Gross, 69, to Spiegel.
The details have been managed as a precautionary measure.
The following is at issue is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they are able to do so.
You can not put in front of 7,500 workers to their children, if they are not skilled enough to do so.
That would end up with the children and also with the company.
Crude was revealed on Thursday that it will withdraw from January the presidency of the board and that Paul-bernhard Kallen has been appointed as his successor.
This member of the family Kallen, of 52 is since 1999 member of the direction of crude.
Initially was responsible for the technology.
Later, he was in charge of the Treasury and with that came responsibility on the heritage of the company. Following the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also took charge of direct marketing, abroad, impression and finance.
For the first time, any member of the family holds the apex of the editorial.
The children of crude have 19 and 17 years. His son Felix, which currently would have 42 years, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to, "save the differences of 10, 15 years," according to Gross.
100% of the holding will be in the hands of the family.
With one eye on the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffle, Gross said that family businesses are not safe from the decadence: "That has always affected families left by the lure of search for capital, which have judged wrong and thought they could rise as well as the greatest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I never had "delusions of grandeur," says Gross.
I do not see it as a politician in this country, as it was, and I do not want to play with the time "in the World League; these businesses have become too big.
The promise of Fonpeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that serves only to look at the mail, not even able to see some kind of deputy or surf the Web.
Enjoyed their five minutes of fame in the US. When Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
See it on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a monthly quota very low, less than half of what is paid, for example, by the plan of data visualization.
Given the success the company has brought two new devices: one exclusively designed to Twitter, the other with a free service of data for life in return for pay six times as much for the peek.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the event Web him, is the European version of the invention and its third Encarnaciónn.
It is as limited as its American counterpart, but comes with a surprise.
The price of monthly maintenance, of around 12 euros a month, includes the roaming across Europe.
Travelers with a smartphones already know what it is like to have to give up the data when it crosses the border or seek desperately a bar with WiFi (or a connecting Fon) in order to be able to consult the mail.
The idea of a roaming to fixed price is incredibly attractive and long ago that would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience there is a need for a doctorate in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print.
Repeated stresses of ears of the European Commission to bring charges of roaming affordable for the whole of Europe hardly have had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin are afraid to use the data, and rightly so.
A Aparatito as Fonpeek (is really curious bearing the name of FON when lacks WiFi) such charges mean that operators are starting to think differently and studying different proposals with which its data network.
Kindle is another good example, includes the trafficking of unloading of books and other consultations on the Internet.
Without contracts and bagpipes.
It is a connected device and paid for it at the buy it, not month to month.
And that is what I hope to see one day with Fonpeek, an option to purchase with access for life as that peek already has in the US.
Not because I will buy it.
I watch my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The colour fetish of Michelle
The yellow is, without doubt, the preferred tone of the American first lady.
If it went to the inauguration of Barack Obama as US president with a dress and a coat of this colour, has chosen the same to him in, without doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has brought a similar model on the two occasions: In addition to being a similar colour - yellow Verdoso with brilliant reflexes - twice the dress was composed of three parts - dress, jacket and coat of the same challenge - and Adornaba with a great or shackles.
So much so that at first glance it looked like the first lady of the United States followed the trail of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat Vestaurio.
But the question where are the two suits makes them very different.
If for taking possession of was a fit fat, in Oslo is a velvet with.
The additions have also varied: shoes greens half Tacón last time, and a similar model, but in Golden, now.
And just as different is the hair: a included on this occasion, throwing the previous one.
75% of working mothers has had problems working on her maternity
discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women in the younger generation who want to be mothers.
It reveals the study' fertility and trajectory of women in Spain', produced by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of women.
The survey conducted between 9.737 women from 15 to 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working mothers saw limited opportunities in the workplace because of motherhood.
The study notes that there are many differences in the beginning of cohabitation of couples and the number of children, depending on whether or not work and the type of work carried out.
Those that do not have an activity outside the home, working part time, or have a stable work, starting before cohabitation of couples, the first motherhood, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable jobs, mainly in the public sector, delayed coexistence and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women of between 35 and 49 years with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, a figure that rises to 4.1 women on fixed jobs have needed more time in your life to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of the children.
In addition, the type of work played wields much influence on motherhood although less about the timing of the pairing, "explains the CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of studies is another factor that difference age for women to marry and to have the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the greater the age at which marrying and which have the first child.
The difference is also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group of between 35 and 49 years, which have studies elementary and higher were mothers for the first time to the 25,1 and of average respectively.
"There is also another division between women depending on their level of studies.
While those with basic studies marrying and have their first child before getting a job stable, those of average levels or higher invest this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable work as a prerequisite to the marriage and the arrival of a Child ", detailing Delgado.
Diane Kruger also applies

It does not do so in the foreseeable genders and formidable (Biográfica, life and work), but looking for something similar to the core of ignition of the character creator.
The trip has its Excitaciones and not save scares or Iluminaciones.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to readings and Relecturas.

On Samuel Beckett: "nihilistic, Christian, wrote what was in the blood, not the intellect, between the powerlessness and ignorance, with a mood dazzling, pointless, as the roadmap of the knife that was about to."

On William Faulkner: "It was a rare sort.
In itself, sometimes said that it was heir of a landowner in the county and others that it was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both were dreams of greatness. "

cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother in about 70 years of age by our neighbourhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years passed along to her and our dog, a copy of race, rescued the Perrera and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without word, you two kicked that left the dog Malherido.
Our outrage is because we do not find the fun in a gratuitous attack to a small animal and helpless, which by the way, was tied.
Add to this the suffocating that led him to a lady who was passing by quietly and that, when these individuals came to fear for their physical integrity, as a madman which attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man, or, in short, with whatever weaker than himself.
The incident occurred at 5 p.m. any Tuesday by a district traditionally quiet.
The dog was in tears all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a police station close to doubt that serve much and for not generate sensitivities, only to clarify that the cowardly killers were Spaniards.
The outrage has led us to condemn this fact.
We do not understand is happening among young people to consider fun free of charge to a helpless animal that we give affection, company and friendship.
We do not know where they have been good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the hull
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, with the cooperation of the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the hull, mainly among younger motorcyclists, reported today both entities.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using the hull, because it is the only element of protection capable of avoiding injuries to the head or, even, death in the case of an accident while circulating in motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer every day" and said that it also contributes to this goal through other actions of character educational and informative.
This new campaign promoting the use of the hull in the motorcycle, under the slogan "to be or not to be', will have a first phase will be distributed posters in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the goal of achieving the highest spread.

Rising sales of commercial
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles is starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9.425 units that will be licensed in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of manufacturers ANFAC and sellers Ganvam.
The good thing, not to be put in quarantine because the reference to the comparison - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60% drop on the previous year.
A result is that, despite the upturn in the last month, the registrations accumulated in the 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January have been sold 95.853 units together all vehicles that make up the hotchpotch of the commercial light: derived from cars, pick up, vans, vans and trucks / chassis light.
Also, have not gone away the clouds that affect more demand, because although they are also purchased by individuals, the majority of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
So to the restrictions of the tap closed for banking loans, is in addition to other factors such as the increase in the levels of unemployment, or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
Against this background and Unlike cars, have long served aid to the purchase of the 2000 E.
To them eligible, as well as individuals, the self-employed and small businesses that will acquire a commercial slight of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions than 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of transactions has been.
Yesterday, since Ganvam to remember the need to devote special attention on the part of the administration to these vehicles and also to the industrial (lorries and buses).
The sellers' association predicts a similar 2010 a year that has just, for which estimated a fall in sales (of cars and 4 x 4) of 19%.
Support for the emergency brake is compulsory
Just as happened with the anti-blockade of brakes abs and will happen with the stability control EPC systems help the emergency will have to be a compulsory element in European cars.
In fact, they already are in all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles of new registration, while the rest is set for a period of absence until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians while on his way to work, it can also help prevent many collisions by scope.
The assistant to the emergency brake it does is increase the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, the system detects the Pisotón which gives the driver.
But this is not always maintains that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of components for car Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not come to step on the brakes before the collision and half of them took the full force.
Until 1.1 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum to the system, reducing the distance that used the car to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with such elements, could be avoided annually until 1.1 fatal accidents in which they are involved pedestrians.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four claims with damage to people - when Popularicen so-called intelligent system of emergency.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a house) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, will help increase the pressure on, if necessary.
If they do not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device puts the brakes every effort to minimize the damage.
General Motors delayed until January the plan for Opel
While the workers at the Opel plant at Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been alerted by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, of which the new production will begin in the first week of April - the day 8 - probably reported Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What to Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is that every one of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this may make the final document that will be put to workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are factories, delayed until the beginning of 2010.
However, since GM ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aims to acquire Volvo, but takes force the option of the Dutch manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg.
If there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some assets of Saab to BAIC China.
Is the decision to close Saab by the end of the year if it is not sold.
At the wheel of Porsche Boxster Spyder
For Desarrolar his last, and expensive jewel, the engineers of Porsche took Boxster S As basis and that Adelgazase nothing less than 80 kg, which has left the Báscula in only 1.275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, firstly, automatic roof that was for one with manual, save 21 kilos; using doors of aluminum and the GT 3, fall' other 15; taking away the Climatizador, 13; reducing fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, won 7 kilograms more; sports Bacquets other 12 and with the slight of 19 inches, five.
Finally, give up the audio system Cor - 30 brought six kilograms and changing the doors for each question, the remaining kilo.
Although also offers with climate KDP double, the test was carried out on a unit with the manual box of six speeds, mainly for secondary roads of California, in stretches of mountain with routes really Revirados
Their behaviour can only be described as beyond reproach.
Reducing Weight does not mean that the car is not the asphalt with aplomb.
Quite the contrary: It was time that Testábamos not a model so small and light that, well, so security in the step on the curve, even at high speeds.
It is a small athlete, able to heat their muscles in a short running for as long as necessary, until I get that Esprinte, which curbed, which recovers and returns to squeeze its motor ...
What ask. Thank you for your leadership, as forthcoming as needed, what with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Engine noise at will
The sound of a V 6, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is well managed and can be boosted with the option'' and through a system that changes the roar of the engine, earlier in the Panamera.
The ability of acceleration is brutal, whether from unemployed or in recoveries.
The suspensions are firm but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The asphalt roads that we are going through with the Boxster Spyder was punished enough, but the car Digirió well the bumpy.
Electronic aid barely did act of presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the graphs are ice at the dawn and Gravilla, already well into the morning.
In short, a car, the more fun to drive that you can in the market and that is something more than a simple amendment of the Boxster S.
The car will be on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70.831 euros.

The team Vitoriano was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, orchards or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work but had to suffer until the end to take the victory.

English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first partial.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the team Alavés opted for the game inside Barac and the work, which was received with Pitos and applause in the return to that outside his house, to continue to extend their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to be highlighted as the best of his team with 13 points, while the least six' assessment of splitter already did presage that this was going to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the party, despite being on track to rest, was not far from decided and the Macabeos wanted to remind Vitorianos that in your room not earn anyone, and with "the hand of' tightening managed in the party.

The team Malagueño not by the atmosphere of the flag of peace and friendship and not by the entity's rival, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed to dream of the Andalusian. Aggressive defence and three consecutive triple, two of the basis Omar Cook and one of Guillem, to the local, minute 9.

Brazil puts date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has since run the permanence of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president will have to leave the diplomatic Legación later than 27 January 2010, when his term officially end.
Francisco Catunda, responsible business of Brazil's embassy in the capital Hondureña, confirmed to TV Globe that "Mel" knows that must come before that date of the embassy, where remains refugee since 21 September.
"He is aware that must come out on 27 January, at the end of his term, must look for another destination."

Thank you very much
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which the inflation of assets has been the dominant feeling in the markets, new uncertainty again in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is its natural state, in an environment in which the players make decisions about the future uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilise markets was monetize debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving free bar of liquidity at rates close to zero for financial institutions assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have virtually completed and, without questioning its policy of liquidity, are beginning to throw some sand in the wheels how did the ECB with its auction to year next week.
Therefore, investors have doubts about the ability of the global economy to keep economic recovery without such measures and we are seeing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock markets and the spreads on corporate bonds have returned, although still a long way from the levels Paranormales that reached earlier this year.
The states were forced to socializing risk private and public debt back to be affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuge elected by investors, leading to an extension of the differences in euro-zone countries to Germany.
Spain had been affected by this episode of instability but in that came standard & Poor's and threatened with a new downward revision of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty not harm to silence the defenders of the moral hazard that trying again to create office of awareness of the responsible for global economic policy for having slowed the destructive effects of the credit restriction on the destruction of employment, when what we should do is issuing a new day of action thanks.
However, what of Dubai pint in a tribal fight between the emirs to re-establish the power in the Emirates and Greece we have seen it before.
A government that conceals public deficit, elections and a new government that throws of the blanket.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that the Ecofin Salvase Hungary to a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and that it will allow a member state of the euro reneging on its commitments.
What makes sense is that the ECOFIN has forced the Greek government to be transparent and share responsibility to their citizens of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, how we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, would be within expectations.
In the case of Spain, while our differences in public debt extended like corporate bonds in Europe we should not be concerned.
If European differentials are falling and ours still widening, then it would be risk Spanish.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our indicators are forcing the majority of services of studies to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to revise upwards its scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not suggest much hope of life to his warning.
Again, he is quite pint that will be an excellent opportunity to buy assets in Spain, although for the moment "prudence, friend driver".

The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in the discussion these days Spain's energy strategy in the next two decades.
After his speech, followed the president's gas Natural-fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, gave the press a few of what had raised in the subcommittee behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 million between then and 2030, always keeping open nuclear power plants in operation today.
Otherwise, the investments will not be of 60 billion, but of up to 95 million.
Of course, believes that in the next decade investments should not be used to increase capacity on generation but on distribution networks and international links
From 2020, the issue is changing and it will have to increase the power.
Its bid focuses both gas plants such as coal with carbon capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, believes that it takes 18 MW new, of course, with other "support".
Galán, which considers that the draft law of sustainable economy that has just been adopted by the government is in line with what his company has been calling for, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage the use of coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear commitment to the long term" In this sense, despite the measures "targeted", as the president of Iberdrola.
Be that as it may, believes that investment decisions, although in the long term, it must begin to take it because it takes to ripen and a stable framework is needed to address them.

The list the lead Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, more money Facturaron for participating the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both face.
Furthermore, Spain is only the third country that has made more money through the champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, four from Italy, the three of England and Germany's two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated procedure for the distribution of money applied by UEFA.
For this financial year, the body that governs Michel Platini join millions for the Champions League.
This money UEFA will devote 413,1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the preliminary round of classification (including Athletic Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, in addition to other euros for each party.
There are also bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and Empatar (400,000 for each team). The Octavofinalistas will receive three million each; the eight Cuartofinalistas, 3.3 million.
The last four are Embolsarán 4 million each.
The champion won 9 million, compared to the 5.2 million of the intervention.
So, in the form of fixed payments, a club at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The On the other hand, 2.5 million by winning the Supercopa of Europe in August.
But it is also are variable payments, which are targeted 337,8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spaniard is leading, and has four seats allocated.
The previous year's champion falls to 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the quarter.
The other part will be paid according to the number of parties that are playing in this year's edition.
