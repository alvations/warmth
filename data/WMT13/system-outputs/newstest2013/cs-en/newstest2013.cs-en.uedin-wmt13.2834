The strategy of the Republican Party against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justify its policy of necessity of the fight against electoral fraud.
Brennan's Centre, such a fraud refers to as the myth that election fraud is less common in the US than the number of people who die after lightning struck.
Republican lawyers, in the last ten years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US.
One thing is certain: The new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the American part of the democratic system.
Unlike in the US, Canada, have the responsibility for the organisation of federal elections of individual states.
And in this spirit of most American governments since 2009, promulgated by the new laws that make it difficult for the process of elections, or write to the electoral list.
This phenomenon has expansion after the elections in November 2010, during which there were 675 new Republican representatives in 26 countries.
As a result, it was only for the year 2011 presented 180 of restrictive electoral law in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to present photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
Moreover, these laws limiting the period for the elections in advance, override the right to register on the list of voters on election day and voting rights of citizens odnímají registration in the register.
Before the elections in 2006 did not require voters to present photo identification půkazu with no US state.
The first state, who led this requirement, Indiana.
The constitutionality of the indianského confirmed in 2008, the US Supreme Court.
Republican officials hurried to the enlargement of the procedure and in other states.
In the last two years to support the proposals for such laws in 34 states with the aim of forcing voters to give identity cards with photographs.
It should be noted that, unlike Quebec are not American citizens universal identity card, such as health insurance card.
In fact, half-11% of American citizens, i.e. the 21 million people aged to vote, no identity card with a photograph of their state-issued by a government authority.
It does not have an identity card for about five million new voters in 2012.
In addition, the acquisition of the identity card is often more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affect mainly young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with income below $35 000; 18% of citizens over 65 years old, and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years old, therefore, does not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are as voters known for their shift to democratic candidates in several countries are not entitled to use his identity card with a photograph displayed his school.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of the hunting and fishing clubs who elect more Republican candidates, cards issued by those clubs in the elections.
In 2004, did not require any state in the election proof of citizenship.
The first such a requirement in Arizona.
From 2011, about a dozen states have laws requiring voters to show that they are American citizens.
Obviously, these measures are aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer Democratic Party.
Republican legislators in 2011, supported in eight states laws that cancelling the registration of voters on election day.
In addition to limit the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to write.
Those restrictions have their consequences.
For example, during the general election in 2004 helped campaign for the registration of voters to register around 10 million inhabitants.
The measures taken after 2009 but has caused a decline in registering new voters in 2010 to 17% compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers in five other states have adopted laws aimed at shortening the period for the elections in advance.
For example, during the general election in 2008 in Florida were African-American, 33% of voters who voted in advance, although afroamerických voters in this state was only 13%.
For Hispanics, it was the same.
They were only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens of voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who accounted for 76% of all voters, there were only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Against the approval of laws that restrict the registration of voters, of course, very strongly built Democratic legislators and their supporters.
Democratic governors veto blocked several bills.
In order to suspend the controversial laws even hit the Prosecutor-General of the United States.
Some of them have managed to limit the damage.
For example, the laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with a photograph taken only 16 of 34 states.
The newly introduced rules but undeniably difficult in 2012, the exercise of the right to vote.
Democratic critics talk about bias approved laws and they are seen as an obvious attempt to influence the results of the elections in 2012 in key states.
Brennan's Centre in 2011, the report shows that the states where those laws were approved, account for 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed for victory in the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that the legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain already: The new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the American part of the democratic system.
The detection of prostate cancer: Complete examination or not?
PSA test was often incorrect results, which were wrongly negative or even a false positive, leading to unnecessary medical emergencies.
All of this has increased the reluctance of the men who had been so reluctant to go to the test.
To investigate or not?
We asked two experts on the view.
In studies conducted in the US have shown a high level of contamination between the test groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and bring valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, said the different mortality rates among patients who have undergone tests, and those who didn't go to them.
The study also showed the 12letém detachment that those who do not go to the test, they have about 30 to 40% higher risk of metastasis.
I therefore commend examination from 50 years of age or from 40 years, if your direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men are also more at risk of African-American origin.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is discovered.
There are aggressive forms of cancer and such species that are inert.
It is therefore necessary to explain that the level of danger of his type of cancer, to offer him a possible alternatives, not necessarily do not treat prostate cancer, which is not in the long-term impact on the life and focus in these cases more active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many of the men who had been diagnosed with cancer cure, as their kind of cancer is not an aggressive and threatens them for life.
They propose to the implementation of active surveillance and, in the case of disease progression we offer them treatment.
More frequently and with greater precision setting criteria, which will help in deciding which type of treatment and which do not.
Therefore, I recommend the tests.
But it is important and interviewed by a doctor to determine whether it is appropriate to take the test or not.
In cooperation with the International urologickou companies created Movember movement tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons in connection with PSA testing.

The prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research seems to be the best means to reduce the risk of the disease of the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if all healthy eating and moving enough, you could prevent up to 30% of cases of cancer.
"If they stop smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%," underscores the Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
By contrast, it is estimated that about 10% of the cancer causing heredity.
Some percentage also remains completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society remains a priority for the fight against smoking, even though the number of smokers declines.
Cigarettes worth 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
It is extremely harmful to human health.
"Today is in Quebec 1.5 million smokers," the spokesman Andre Beaulieu, shaking his head.
An encouraging statistic: 10 years after a smoker stops smoking, the risk of death from cancer by half.
The mass of
According to the SCC appeared and obesity are another risk factor for the disease.
Increase the risk of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, esophagus, pancreas and the uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against cancer of the colon," says the report.
Nutrition for the
The organization also recommended reducing the consumption of red meat.
At too high consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is best to avoid the sausages, for which is the same.
Smoked meat canning, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"May cause damage to the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," says the report.
The vitamins
In recent times, various scientists focused on the link between vitamínovými accessories and cancer.
Polls, however, have yet to produce a clear conclusions.
Studies on vitamin E are the SCC contradictory.
Although, according to one of them is to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, other studies suggest the increase.
Even the effect of vitamin D to cancer is not clearly established.
Mr Beaulieu also insists on how important it is to talk about their concerns and the precedent of the family with your doctor.
"To the investigation does not mean that you have cancer."
Higgs boson examined
The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs bosonu likely caused a stir last summer.
There is a view that the boson is involved in the mechanism, which is responsible for all the mass in the universe.
And then there is the last particle whose existence was predicted the standard model - our best or the "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which, however, has not yet been empirically observed.
Among the physicists, however, so far there is no 100 percent certainty that it is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle, which is very similar to this Higgs bosonu, as foretold the standard model.
New data released this week during a physical congress in Kyoto to confirm the absence of any data yet, so that we can have absolute certainty.
However, let's assume that it is the Higgs boson, because of the risk of error appears to be small, and let's see what's happening.
In this world is absolutely unambiguous law, according to which the two things can occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be ignored - and don't try too hard, otherwise you're gonna get hurt.
Even if the particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it is a similar law: Pauli exclusion principle, according to which the two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - the "state" roughly speaking creates some of their properties.
The particle physicists further divided into two categories.
On the one hand, we find an orderly citizens, or fermiony, obediently comply with Pauli principles.
And at the other end of the range bosony, anarchists, who weighs nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means that they may well be in the same place at the same time.
These bosony is further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way, absolutely wonderful), which is The Particle Adventure, in the laboratories of the Berkeley: Mesony, here we go unnoticed, and "the particles," which is a natural forces and with which the Higgs boson is probably related in some way.
However, to say that these bosony are not as exotic pets, how it would be possible to believe.
If you read this article, it is thanks to bosonu with unusual banality: The photon, or particle of light, "which is" a "electromagnetic force.
When particles with an electrical charge to accelerate or change their direction, "disturbed" by the electromagnetic fields in this particular place, like a pebble tossed into a pond.
From this "distraction" an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this is nothing other than the photon - and thus one of bosonů, "of the force."
A more stable
It is also a Higgs bosonem, except that "disturb" should be another field, Higgsovo field that the boson.
This Higgsovo field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic fields; the excitation is to achieve very high energy levels, similar to the frozen surface of a pond, which moves a lot of a large rock.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator CERN accelerator at the laboratory as part of the Large Hadron Collider, the friendly ties is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop a power.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field suits us once again to clarify the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
Responding to the electromagnetic field, all of the particles or all the materials.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never be itself to stick on the fridge.
And it is true that the Higgs field, the particles do not respond: Those that do have some mass, while others (such as the photon, look at him) do not have it.
And Mrs. Smith asks what all of these studies are what "us"?
From the point of view of science is a validation of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to examine any discrepancy between the observations and predictions of SM.
In addition, many physicists have literally wants to find them, because the slightest difference could open space "new physics" and close some of the loopholes in the model.
It should be noted that the model is still huge shortcomings, no clarification of gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which account for about 80% of the matter (oops!).
So far, however, the CERN facilities such contradictions there.
Response of
The response of these research in everyday life, Mr and Mrs Novákových can be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be no.
Behold: At the beginning of the 1960s pioneers laser at Bell Labs had no idea of the revolution, for their work.
Assumed the scientific use, but nothing else.
The physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous light pulse) in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially considered to be such a "toy in the lab."
Just imagine.
And besides, the result of all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle has created a light sensor in 1969 during their work aimed at optics.
The scanner, even though it Boyle first as planned, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC we necessarily have to change your life, but it means that no one really knows.
Palliative care - the best way to go through life... | Le devoir
The Commission, through its for dying with dignity is Quebek recently engaged in a delicate issues relating to the end of life.
The debate should soon resume, and at the same time is going to the bill.
In this crucial area, there is still a lot of work to do.
The magazine Le devoir tried to look at this issue in more detail.
Less than a couple of weeks ago, Mr. L. still alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, which consumed him, gave him a two-year reprieve.
"They gave me five years of life, and it's been seven," said without emotion in his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its work: The extreme weakness makes it impossible for him to remove himself to the toilet or feed himself.
Resignation is looking at appetizing breakfast and agrees to help him to eat.
It's a bold and even smiles, talking to strangers who stop for him, his medication, offer a bath.
The courage to a death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhoea, humiliated me," she says.
A few hours later, he found a team of doctors on his problem.
"In all my life and learn that the guys in the urine," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois.
To return to the stage of the child is for some people unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of a person's" whether the return, says psychologist.
In the view of many people involved in palliative care, the crucial moments are taking place at the heart of such a return.
The patients who are at home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois, all suffering from cancer.
The forecast is a maximum of three months to live.
At this stage, they are a team of doctors and nurses who care for them, to provide so-called "therapeutic" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, is the worst fear to die of suffocation in full knowledge. "
But the disease has allowed me to discover their children.
"I have good kids," he adds.
"In my life I don't have any desire," he says, and then allow us to put on her breathing apparatus.
Yet still enjoys in the coming days on the last visit to the son of Italy.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers to provide care for the body with the help of nutrition.
It looks like palliative care, which is, if you cannot do anything else.
The death was more comfortable.
In Québeku seems a bed palliative care to 11 700 people.
It's very little, if we realise that we all have to die.
Here, life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martelová, one of the medics at home.
Whether it is the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When you die, you can give him a sip of brandy or Pepsi, for example, according to taste.
Diabetics will no longer need to watch the level of sugar.
And the death is a part of everyday life.
Last night, carrying beer, Mr X, who later died in the night.
This morning, drinks beer his son in honor of the late father.
"We are helping patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care services.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois go days, one after the other, but like each other.
In addition to the year old man who rejoices in the last meeting with his family thoroughly vypodložený on cushions, while in hushed voices in his honor, died tragically šestatřicetiletý man surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children after he tried all options in order to survive.
"For half a year, there is always the three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer to 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martelová with concern.
53% of the patients who come to the home of Victor-Gadbois, here comes from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
The problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply does not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering as soon as sick in the final phase of his life, whether it's at home, in the hospital and in a halfway house.
And some organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and Society for domestic palliative treatment of the Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively on the care given to cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental lack of access to health care in Quebec, many doctors specialising in palliative care is concerned about the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October is already in circulation manifesto signed by leaders in palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard LaPointe, evidenced by its opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martelové Quebec health care system is not sufficiently powerful to ensure access for all people to high-quality palliative care before it will be possible to agree with the implementation of euthanasia.
As he says, has recently experienced a patient who has spent 14 days on standby in great pain without anyone took the necessary steps to be relieved.
He fears that patients do not ask about the killing on the grounds that they lack the appropriate care.
And at the same time, many oncologists care of their patients until the last moments, regardless of the negative outlook.
Hopes for the survival of Hélène Richardové were already quite minimal, leaving intensive chemotherapy.
When I told my onkoložce that concludes with the treatment, said she regrets that I fight, tells us.
And he told me that it's over!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martelová estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die, thanks to his treating physicians to fill their wish when their team palliative pussy ease the pain.
But it is necessary to say that palliative care is certainly not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereauové, director of palliative care at the Society for domestic palliative care the Grand Montréal, patients are defending the treatment of pain in the 8% of cases.
At the very end of his life, doctors often use palliative sedation, which the patient to sleep until the end, whatever fits and starts, or whether the sedative administered on a permanent basis.
You cannot pretend that we do not see this part of the suffering.
The patient, who beat the pain, will have more opportunities to access paliativním sedation.
Sick, which is not given a sedative, always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean "I want you to give me the euthanasia," it means, 'I want to get rid of the pain. "
The implementation of this story to grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Research in the health sector.
Large-scale real estate scandal in Quebec
Administration officials, entrepreneurs in construction and public works, the lobbyists political parties and experts on the Italian Mafia still tell what they know about the amazing "system" in which the construction, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and organized crime.
The "field" came in Quebec taxpayers dearly, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It is interesting how the system crumbled since we have taken strong measures," says ironically Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former chief of police in Montreal.
It erupted in 2011 scandal on the basis of rigorous investigation focused on embezzlement of funds in connection with contracts for the construction of roads in Quebec, which the former liberal Quebec Premier Jean Charest has approved only after long delays.
"Duchesneauova report" confirmed a direct link between industry, the murky financing of parties and corruption of public officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "but the Ministry of Transport to save a billion dollars worth of contracts," when some people keep in check his instincts to get their share.
Charbonneauova Commission "has already led to the resignation of two of the mayor," he adds, in the hope that she could "to uncover the subtlety of some people."
Permanent unit to combat corruption, based in 2011
Permanent unit to combat corruption, based in 2011 is also involved in a fight with his army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
The police officers' Marteauovy company "from 2009 to ensure that" the cartel montrealský penězovodů "significantly reduced inflation contracts.
In recent weeks, carried out a series of searches and accused of fraud and corruption of local councillors, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a municipality from the suburbs.
Next on the list is to be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly took bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have already received the traffic engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, for example, Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation when the commission said the mechanism "system" of public procurement.
During these years he spent 3% of the value of the contracts which gained v Montréalu, a middle-man associated with the Mafia, then transferring the money side of the Union Montréal, for which he was running for mayor Gérald Tremblay.
After the year 2000, Zambito was generous to all parties and gave more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) a provincial parties, in particular, however, the Liberals, who were then in power.
He also confessed to organizing the illegal finance for the former liberal vicepremiérku Nathalie Normandeauovou.
The contract with penězovody, whose prices nadsazoval
In Montreal, "system" of corruption.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transportation engineer, it before the commission described in great detail: During the 10 years he received from construction companies gifts, invited on trips, golf tournaments, to restaurants, to hockey games and pocket money worth a total of 736 million dollars in exchange for contracts with penězovody which nadsazoval price.
Other public officials from the transport sector admitted that they pay fees for about 30% to 40% by means of false invoices víceprací.
The organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont then accused Tremblaye that his eyes without embarrassment over the parallel budget, which led to his Treasury dirty money.
On the basis of these revelations Tremblay resigned in early November, which put Montreal in large-scale crisis.
Chantal Rouleau montrealskými was among the first members who issued a warning signal.
As the mayor of the district Rivière-des-prairies to the east of the island from 2010 advocates against the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million promotérům... right in the middle of prosperous trade in real estate.
The 70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will be finally opened, says that "pulling the strings in an attempt to understand the operation of the system promořeného ants to stop gangrene and načapalo culprits."
According to her, "the process is painful, but a positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but it is necessary to establish a v Montréalu own investigative unit, and to ensure the sight of these dubious practices could not return.
As cleaning.
Regularly. "
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials were misappropriated hundreds of millions of dollars," but is concerned, in particular the role of "well-informed about this ruse" to those dealing them!
It is estimated that 70% of the financing of election campaigns in Québeku comes from money laundering, and with irony, he adds: "I've heard that it was all the facts."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100, but it will not solve the situation: "As long as strictly restrict election expenses, dirty money out of politics."
It proposes a comprehensive control system of public procurement and funding of parties, "which we cannot fall; focusing boldly on the substance of things we can build on more solid foundations and with greater control and compliance with the law."
If this story defamed image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends that all those who scoff at him to look at their own backyard.
"PSG is FC Barcelona!"
In this season with PSG had an entirely new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into himself, or an entirely new dimension of PSG.
They came to us the big players.
Every day I get beside them further.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
These allow me every day to raise the level of the game.
The games and it's easier.
In football, it is all very quickly.
But I don't lose my head.
Since my beginnings in prep school in INF Clairefontaine after a stopover in Saint-Etienne, I have always pushed for each grade.
Taking advantage of a competitive environment, which has introduced Carlo Ancelotti...
The reinforcements from this summer are used to playing games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it follows that a player like me, then has more flavor to the game, and he wants to make maximum power.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti and gives me a lot in connection with my position.
The hands of the assistants, such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
And Ancelotti has the final word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all the technicians.
Today, in the first league does not equal and are among the best European coaches.
He has vast experience, and with top teams won a lot of titles.
He also worked with excellent players.
For me to win in Paris more titles.
In January, I had a conversation with him.
I was behind a series of injuries.
The trust, which gives me, is another reason for my performance.
How do you see the first part of the season, PSG?
In the first league us Lyon picked up the position.
But we remain in tow.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: We are very easily into osmifinále.
What is your club in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Now, anything can happen.
But we certainly want to be a difficult match for the quality European teams.
First of all, we want to win its qualifying group ahead of Porto, to be able to play in retaliation osmifinále at home.
PSG may be in the short term, a major European club?
The budget for it...
The Paris to become a major European club, must win titles and go down in history.
Today, it is not yet.
On the financial side of the PSG means to this plan could take place.
And it would be a big setback nezvítězit in 1 league as in last season?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year, really want to win the league title.
In the last season, we still missing.
In May, we were disappointed, because we had to win.
We had an excellent season.
We collected 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you are a master.
But another club, Montpellier, had a season even more amazing.
I think that this year it will lead.
Even though the title and the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have the weapons to defeat them.
Do you think that the media from PSG expect too much?
It is not unusual to expect a lot from us, given what's invested and what we have the players.
Absolutely we accept.
It is a fact that when home beat Troyes 4-0 and still find something in the newspaper about us, so it is not very pleasant.
One wonders what you people can still want more.
It is, of course, to win 4-0 on each weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to set up a game style.
You need to build a team.
In the Champions League, we have proven that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who had already qualified for the second season osmifinále, and also have invested large sums of money.
Given the sums invested sums you would expect that you have in front of the other 15 points ahead.
You insult the other clubs and the French league.
Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which in last year's season, too, with the new PSG moved on to the next phase.
This shows how 1 League is amazing.
I hope that in May, we will be able to smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, we have managed to win.
It seems as if PSG in all relied on the performance of Zlatana Ibrahimoviče.
It is good that it says that there is a "dependence on Zlatanovi."
This means that Ibrahimovič is a very powerful and that gives a lot of goals.
To come here and show that it is the star of the first league.
Wherever he has demonstrated that he is a great player, a world star.
In our team we respect the man and the players.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has achieved is really special.
This has led others to raise their level of the game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows for the other side by side growth.
How are you enjoying Euro 2012 with the French representation?
As disappointment.
I wanted to play in this tournament. "
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play as well as I'd imagined.
But I've seen it, and I came out of it stronger.
Today, I'm able to play good matches in the representation.
And that is what I had hoped for since her team.
We have learnt from what happened in Ukraine, and today, we owe it to ourselves, to our behavior was exemplary.
How do you see the first month, Didier Deschampse at the head of the national team?
The results speak for him.
In the qualification for MS, we are in a good place.
The coach is strictly, is the players around and able to win.
That was and Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc has achieved its goal that we qualified for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.
It's a draw (1: 1) from 16 October in Spain a solid baseline game?
This game gave us added confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before the shock in Spain, I experienced such a game in his career.
Thanks to Bitcoinu you can pay and sell without the banks
All the negative effects of the current financial transactions based on the central banks, identified transactions and costs for processing among the beneficiaries.
In the context of these technologies, as is often the case, there is a clear political vision: The belief that the current financial system built on the bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, the inventor's Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both virtual money (transferable, however, the dollar, the euro...), and a similar transfer protocol BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between two pairs of partners.
Thanks to 15 000 computers connected to the network has already been registered about 200 000 transactions.
About a thousand Web sites already taken bitcoiny as gifts or as a means of payment.
Bitcoinu rate peaked at 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later, he dropped to 2 dollars, today it is on the verge of about $10 (overview of the courses is included on page bitcoincharts.com).
In comparison with the world in exchange for real money or financial products, it is not impressive.
And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in his report on the virtual finance, which came out in October.
Bitcoin refers to as "the most successful virtual money," "to rival the dollar and the euro," and "version of the current money."
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual money, as "credits" used for the procedure in the video game, which one will win the game, or you can buy (and sometimes back to change).
The social networking site Facebook also developed a similar system.
Each month, but the central authority controls and processes of the communication.
In the case of Bitcoinu are all the nodes of the network to the depositary of current accounts, supervisors, issuers and buyers and sellers.
How the network works?
Each transaction between two users is in fact between two electronic addresses through e-mail.
However, the user can choose another address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
The file of information related to this transaction is electronically signed encryption system with a key.
Network so it can verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoiny existed in the public book of current accounts, which is distributed across the network.
The key lies in the minutes of this new phase of the transaction in this book.
It is by means of solving mathematical task of the computers, the investigator, a temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional lines.
This is the stage of cutting up the file; i.e. the transformation of a huge file on shorter and a unique digital print.
The computer "take over" the new transaction and add to the number, then the whole "will be cut."
The aim is to find a number that provides specific print (a lot of zeros at the start).
As soon as this number, the other nodes to check its accuracy.
The transaction is indestructible displays linked to a string of all other transactions; any adjustment would be to change the impression.
If the user wanted for fraud to pay twice for the same money very quickly (within 10 minutes), the network is only one of the two transactions - the second will be abandoned, because each of them has a different impression.
The computer that will solve the challenge, wins 50 bitcoinů.
In order to avoid inflation, are divided into two of the regularly, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoinů in circulation is limited by the number of 21 million, but can be divided up to the part in nine hundred million, so there is room for margin.
It also increases the difficulty of the task with increasing levels of calculation.
The network has had its ups and downs.
Web sites that provide services for Bitcoin, were attacked and the alienation of bitcoinů.
"Crack is not in itself," says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, the company for real money, which uses a network of Bitcoin.
The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But the problem is also true for cash.
The major players like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.
Others, like blogging platform WordPress, is adopted.
The ADI Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the current accounts and showed that almost 80% bitcoinů circulation.
In November, was launched "a huge discounts."
"Thirty thousand dollars have changed," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the transformation of Coinabul bitcoinů on gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of educational books on this money, has a lot of confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or bezkontaktnímu payment on her cell phone, but uses the Bitcoin system for verifying the transactions, which are cheaper because of it.
In addition, a managing their identity and so can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set in the traders, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Just tell the address, which can be a telephone "photograph it and recognize," explains Pierre Noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question the hierarchical systems and the transition to a more horizontal systems.
"Before the Bitcoin wins, it will take a while, but the year 2013 could be decisive," predicts.
In its report, the ECB is expected to review the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this kind of money will be successful.
We left from Afghanistan.
And what next?
The French troops have left their area of responsibility in the Kapisa and Surobi (Afghanistan).
NATO and American forces should be followed by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan Army took control of its territory and that the Afghans have chosen their own future and waiting for all of us.
The biggest injury suffered by people in the Afghan countryside, which we punished, as we consider them terrorists.
And so do we, but we lost 88 of the slain soldiers, and all those injured and maimed.
Talibánci consist of foreign extremists, the former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often the peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies, as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though joined the jihadis, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbekové, Tajiks.
They are currently experiencing tolerance and frequent help local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw their support for the fall.
The withdrawal of French troops from the Nijrab, which I watched from the mountaintops posázených mandloněmi thanks to the French loans, orderly.
A convoy of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul with no escort helicopters for aerial attack.
By the end of 2014 talibánci already in Kabul will not be so active.
From their unstoppable process between 1994 and 1996, the conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty, and the country was in the blood and fire as a result of the fighting between the various odbojovými groups.
Take control of their country was regarded as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
The Afghans have paid the price for these villagers obscurantism, which completely dominated the Organization of Al-K 'Ido, their situation, however, has not improved in our time.
Former mudžáhedíni, the Afghan government and the current talibánci agree in an effort to keep women in a subordinate position.
The officials from the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became the junkmen soldiers, grabbed the public land, which sold as building sites for refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and take advantage of the huge American contracts for subcontractors.
Discredit; most of them had never even been in a fight.
According to what I heard in campaigns, people yearn for the government, which will not be thieves.
Many of the young wants to go as they leave those who were able to take advantage of American generosity: Capital flight is significant.
Young already tired of the war and associated ideology.
During his exile in Iran or Pakistan knew of the modern world and its benefits is interested.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years; in Kabul is currently 5 million people, one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, public schools are full, girls and boys.
These young people will need to provide jobs, they are no longer want to go back to the obscurantism earlier parties or to the corruption of some officials.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, they like mobile phones, television and the Turkish series, which show the modern world, they are everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities who will stand up to her forehead, regarded as legitimate?
The former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army already renewing provincial militias that are beyond the control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence local identity should should enjoy a certain degree of decentralisation along the lines of the Western states, but the US wanted to transform it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so that the abolition of the post of prime minister, which existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
President Karzai wants foreign control, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country is from the 1950s and earlier years significantly dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has failed to restore, no dam doesn't work, there is no major repaired irrigation system.
Everything is imported; it does not produce, fruit and vegetables.
Preferred a private initiative.
In a country devastated by three decades of war would have been necessary government control infrastructure.
Rumors flew that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
And that is fueling the feeling that Western countries were only to be captured.
Without power for the processing of iron ore and copper on the spot and without the means to transport raw materials across the mountains but no minerals can take place.
The Chinese already left Mes Aynak copper mine and let the international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) to explore the possibility of a large Buddhist area to keep their role as a major employer in the province.
One day, it will also need to Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is a large part of imports and exports to resume normal relations.
The departure of French combat troops was completed on November 20.
The new treaty on cooperation assumes the continuation of the normal types of assistance: Girls' and boys' lyce, professor of French at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, worked initiative "to get the heart and soul of" trying to be a difficult task to bring aid and military activities in which he was the "civil-military actions," the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, but, thanks to the small French non-governmental organisation of a number of successes in the areas of common interest and steps for agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
The work, which involved a number of local workers, helped to dampen the insurgency: Irrigation wells, drinking water, forestation, fruit trees, soil conservation and expansion of cultivable land.
What kind of memory to leave after two billion military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very difficult in these valleys, which are often at an altitude of over 2 000 m.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for a small agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
These farmers to be liberated from the uprising led by foreign groups, they want to make a civil assistance in their favour, which would be properly controlled and touching them directly.
Difficult to work on the Egyptian constitution
President Muhammad Mursí went to another poker game.
While Egypt remains in its history, the most divided because of the Constitution, which gives him temporarily unlimited powers, he decided to play a hunch.
On Wednesday, he said, without regard to the views of all the other that the Constituent Assembly approved the final text of the next day.
Less than a week ago by the head of state of this Assembly another two months to complete the work.
For almost two years, Egypt is a text, which was supplemented by many times, which undermines the stability of the country and leads to legal controversies.
This new initiative will only further strengthen the ambivalence of the country.
From the point of view of the opposition, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium," to "violates his word" and "tramples on the right."
His supporters, however, have been assured that this is a means to quickly deal with the constitutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.
In two weeks, should be a referendum.
It is a very short period of time, which would force the Brotherhood's intention to withdraw from the text of the Egyptians to clarify the article by article.
For the president, it is also a way to achieve national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country by the protests.
As confirmed in an interview with the US weekly magazine Time, Muhammad Mursí appears to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people with an ultimatum: "Either approve my text, or keep the unlimited powers," which otherwise would have ended after the approval of a new constitution.
And in this particular air yesterday 85 members of a constitutional assembly with a large majority of Islamists text approved.
Most of the Liberals in the vote was missing.
In mid-November, shortly before the announcement of the Constitution, bouchli doors that do not have the opportunity to promote their views.
Defenders of human rights, of civil society or members of religious minorities in their step.
In order to achieve a quorum, was yesterday morning hastily added 11 people from among the replacements.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
No surprise, then, that the articles of the Constitution have often voted unanimously.
Commentators have also suspended over the fact that one of the few disputes the day revolved around... hours for prayer, when some members of the committee argued that the clock in the conference room are not properly adjusted.
The text, which was voted on last night, is composed of 234 articles.
The subject of widespread attention, Article 2, remains the same, with a version of the 1971 constitution and states that "the principles of sharia law is the main source of law."
The Salafi parties for the introduction of Islamic law which is one of the essential requirements, hoping to replace the term "principles," the term "rules," which would allow stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this has not been repaired, is a sign of their good will and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," argue the liberals, who see it as just a figure of the problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is through other articles.
Focus in particular Article 220, which confers on the University of Al-Azhar advisory role, especially on the issue of control of the conformity of laws with Sharia law.
According to an expert on Egypt Sophie Pommierové it is disturbing, because "persons called to express are chosen, and they have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see this as the beginnings of a theocracy. "
The Liberals even more stirring up the fact that the next president of the University of should be less moderate than the current one.
"For the moment, there was no specific religious consequence.
With this constitution remains in Egypt by the state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, not ulamové, but the university workers, many of them trained in French schools, "is tempered by fears Alexis Blouet, who is preparing to work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
They agree, however, that "there may be differences over the interpretation of Article 220, because it used terms belongs to a religious vocabulary.
In particular, there is a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, but doable.
And may occur in the future, the question of to what extent they are civilian judges have the authority to be able to express. "
Yesterday, in addition to the religious aspects of the approved text is very criticized because of the expanded powers, which gives the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there had been a significant reduction in the former regime.
Another contentious point: The powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the leaders of the army will be checking the defence budget to parliament, but the National Council of Defense.
Then there will be prohibited in the military court proceedings with civilians, as requested by the association for the protection of human rights.
These associations in connection with the text, which is directed against freedom of its concerns.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult is still banned, which could have serious consequences for the freedom of expression, especially for the press.
No, it does not address the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayefová of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point of the ban on torture, referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was speaking last night in a televised speech, are scheduled for this afternoon rally.
Supporters of the head of state will manifest on Saturday.

"The great and powerful" that Moscow: Emigrants would save money on language
While members of parliament and human rights activists are still debating the law on compulsory testing in the country have already discovered the fraudsters who sell "counterfeit" certificates
In Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities comes 13 million foreign workers each year.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkménie.
Their sole aim is to earn enough money to support families back home.
On 1 December came into force of the law, according to which each migrant workers will be required to pass the test of knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and urban economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, the FMS promises that over time the tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
The test, however, will consist not only of language skills, but also in Russian history and of the foundations of the law.
Knowledge of the language will also be reinforced to obtain and an extension of the work permit.
The exemption applies only to the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.
This law is not even people who have managed to successfully attestation and get an academic degree to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
The benefits, the conviction and the protection of the rights
The network test sites will work under the auspices of The Institute of the Russian language, the University of friendship between peoples, Moscow State University, the State University in St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
The migrants can pass tests in all cities; already in Russia is open to more than 160 such centers.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing of the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service (FMS).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders, many in the press to ask the question: What it in fact bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors?
First of all, are representatives of migration services - will allow it to reduce the number of people who are suffering as a result of the "slave labour."
Today, many people are talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, says chairman Viktor Sebelev FMS Russia in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights should be started before their departure.
The only organized recruitment system will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise in the emigrants without jobs, without education, who don't know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without the knowledge of the language, he says with conviction Sebelev - is the future can be sentenced to clashes with unfair people who help him under the pretext of ensuring "reference" to the gruesome, cramped quarters, in which he and dozens of others like himself, suffer for months without food and documents and work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
From our migrant workers receiving many complaints.
"In their homeland, they promise, but after the arrival of a lover, confiscate their passports, paid the promised wages," confirms the main Tajik government labour migration MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't scold!
The less that many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who intend to go to work in Russia, acknowledge that not only don't know the language of the country in which they want to go, but they don't have the experience even with the work.
Of course, it wasn't their fault, as the disaster: Very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least a reasonable basic education.
But also their families in need of something to feed the children, not to mention the fact that it should be decently dressed, shoes and equip school.
As children grow up in the retirement age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without the knowledge of the language, it is difficult -.
"Do you feel the humiliation and inferior."
It is true that with regard to the language tests indicate human rights defenders on one important thing.
The testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, so they won't pass the test, nor any other official would not work.
In the meantime, the majority of migrant workers as well as before in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or No admission for unauthorised entry prohibited"
Many of those workers argue that gain official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - the bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
In addition, the costs money: From 12 to 16 thousand roubles.
But the false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that we have, in fact, false documents, without authorization, and there are cases of extortion.
"Calls for a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," - he had shared with reporters about his experience, a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the validity of the language, it was found that are not only false documents of migrants.
Staff of the FMS already confiscated several false certificates of completion of the language test.
Counterfeit documents are printed on a color printer.
Of course, the new owners were not free: Each of the migrants in the hope that they will make it easier for the problem with the tests, paid for this document seven thousand roubles.
That's two and a half times higher than the official test is completed, it will become migrant workers three thousand roubles.
The main task of the immediate future is to safeguard the system against corruption that workers could simply buy the documents, in that match, government officials and defenders of human rights.
Meanwhile, government authorities can promise that foreign workers who can't handle tests for the first time, the necessary time to have completed a course in the Russian language.
For the visitors, who can't speak Russian, is expected to work in the areas in which does not require an active negotiations with people.
The MVD (Ministry of Interior) does not take into the circulation of illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes using the legally-held weapons is very low
MVD Russia presents a tightening of the law in relation to the owners of the civilian weapons.
The government's response to recent events: The rise were cases of shootings at weddings, which are dispensed with the victims, and the massacre of a Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinogradovem, in which seven people died as a result.
The police want to prohibit the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and to raise the age at which you can obtain a licence to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma's committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarovaja, who promised that changes to the law on weapons will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem of "tightening the screws."
He appeared in the open letter, which the authors - representatives of various social shooting organisations - are demanding rejection "of tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminologist in an interview with the Russian offices of the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior was for six months of the year 2012 142 crimes committed using firearms registered by the Ministry of the Interior, while in the same period was committed a total of 1168 thousands of crimes.
The authors of the open letter are convinced the tightening of legislation in the field of civil weapons fail to get the offender to go on the "black" market.
Currently, according to their words can be found in Moscow any weapon at a low price.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior said that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: From the plants after officers
"The black market in weapons is supplied by several channels.
There are five main channels, says the retired colonel Victor Baraněc, who worked 10 years at the workplace of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot sites that receive orders of weapons
The first of them, "the army or the military path," that is a weapon that had been stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"To steal weapons and Russian officers and Kavkazané themselves," says Baraněc.
The other type of "black" are weapons stolen by criminals for representatives of the security forces.
Baranec explains that this includes theft from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from the staff of the law enforcement authorities.
Illegal "mainly" comes into the sale of military warehouses.
In many of the military warehouses often leads to explosions.
"There is evidence that some of the fires were set deliberately - in order to cover the shortage," says a former soldier.
In the words of its contribution brings Barance and producers of weapons.
"At present, there are private armaments companies, which are not competitive on the international market, and the decommissioning of weapons, which supplies on the black market, including Moscow," said the expert.
Another source of "black market" is smuggling.
A large number of pistols and automatic vending machines from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes weapons produced in small-scale production, and the Mafia, which organised their smooth production," explains the former soldier.
Where is a weapon?
The experts made, what is the approximate percentage of various sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
A report on this issue come up in 2011 Center analysis of the problems and the design of the public administration.
Experts dismantled the statements of the Ministry of Interior and the Russian Statistics Office, kriminologickou literature and public data portals aimed at the theme of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers say, comes from the military and the executive.
Half of all weapons on the black market "because of the officials, whose work is associated with weapons," the report says.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of weapons from armed conflicts, in 14% of the cases, the theft of weapons in their production, 5% is "black archaeology."
The clerk-consultant to one of the shops with weapons, who asked that his name not, is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations "black" archaeologists long ago nobody is buying - are simply too old.
Most often, he says, the sales drive for new shipments directly into the military warehouses.
Despite the Ensign, a candidate to buy the unit, for example, the TT.
For him, the order, and he'll sell it over the fence.
"That will take her to the city, where it sells for 900 euros for a piece of the two magazines," she says.
"The truth is that the police are well on track, and that the plan will burn them at any time in the detection rate for offences carry out the purchase for traders in illegal weapons," he adds.
"As in a luxury store"
The seller to the buyer often find each other through their friends.
I visited Web sites and blogs, until the guy who offered me the opportunity to go on a platform of "Test," where he will be the man who had led me to "corner" where together we will act.
The price of the mainly I learned there
The rapporteur Viktor Baraněc military
If I want to get a gun, I need someone who knows the way out, tells the clerk - poradce.- like that I have known, but I fully trust him.
Sellers on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to convey that her daughter lost a tooth."
And now I get there over a man, I am sure of that.
He is also the only to me, because he knows that I neudám.
Beginners looking for weapons in different ways.
The former soldier Victor Baraněc trying to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when the working paper for publication on this subject.
Schemes, according to his words.
They gave him a photo album with photographs, where it was "all you thought."
"I felt like in the luxury market," says a soldier.
The buyer, according to Baraněce, offer a pig in a poke - everything you can try.
I, a potential client, but I ain't buyin '- we're going with the seller in the forest and we'll build a target.
"Give me a chance to shoot, and when I became convinced that the gun shooting well, we are beginning to act," describes the procedure.
Magazine on the couch
You put on the Internet search engine on the Web site of the "Vkontaktu," which offers to buy weapons "for different purposes."
There are no documents or personal meeting.
"If you have a set amount of money," says in the headline on the website of the "buy a gun or machine."
In these pages users leave their notification and ask questions.
And the sale of a minor?
"Of course, without a license," asks the user "Ivan" (the spelling is preserved).
"I'll buy TT.Moskva" - in formulating the requirement "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently threw a huge network of dummy Web sites and those who wish to buy military weapon, is acquiring a shovel.
The people are as hungry fish to the bait and then winning coal in Siberia.
The rapporteur and senior military official Viktor Baraněc
I have heard of such schemes: Web pages are usually registered beyond the scope of the Russian laws.
People are taking orders.
The buyer will pay over the ATM.
"In response to the seller sends him a photograph and description of the guidelines is a weapon," said a spokesman for non-governmental organisations "Right to gun" Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baraněc confirms that after entering the order on the website, you can remain unarmed and wind up behind bars.
The Federal Security Service recently threw a huge network of dummy Web sites and those who wish to buy military weapon, is acquiring a shovel.
"The people are hungry fish to the bait and then conquer coal in Siberia," confirmed.
Makarov for 100 dollars
You will pay for the purchase of illegal firearms experts estimated that the amount usually from 100 to 900 dollars.
In the words of Dmitri Kislova from non-governmental organisations "Right to gun" seek the Makarov pistol for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait a month to one and a half months.
The weapon was dispatched from stores for long-term storage depots through the middle section.
According to the official statistical office declined compared with the January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia, a total of 7%, and was 22.9 thousands of cases, and the number of solved cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the US, workers are on strike fastfoodů and supermarkets
Work on the premises, "McDonald's" goes through to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, in America, raised a wave of protests against low wages in the hypermarkets of Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald," "Burger King," "Taco Bell," "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken."
So far, no one can predict whether this wave of transformed into a wave of nine, or whether it is destined to disappear soon.
This share support the trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to the modest increase at the salaries they receive rank-and-file workers at Wal-Mart and fast-food systems, the organizers of protests to achieve the creation in their trade unions.
At present, this economic sector virtually untouched odborářským movement.
The 46 cents a year?
The action began last week after Thanksgiving in the so-called "Black Friday," when America struck an orgy of cheap sales, with a million people and, in some cases, was accompanied by the brawls.
On this day, some workers, Walmart, which works worldwide to 2.2 million people, leaving their workplaces and demonstrated together with the trade unions and left-wing activists multinationals retail chains, whose goods is addressed to the people of the lower and middle classes.
Wal-Mart sells around the world everything from diapers over hunting rifles and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-wage workers in stores Wal-Mart buys only in his work.
The availability of a wide range of goods made from the chain Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
In the words of critics can afford to sell their goods as cheaply Walmart, partly because few pay their employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as a lack of automatic trucks or hand-held scanners.
The demonstrators on the "black Friday" to demand an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by companies increased sharply from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical worker Walmart is 9.5 dollars an hour, but it does not match the height of the expenses, they say.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley has shown that if Wal-Mart will increase the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion dollars a year.
It is an average of 1.1% more than the company spends on salaries now.
If the company moves to increase wages, Wal-fully on the shoulders of consumers, will each visit at the store only about 46 cents more.
For the year as customers will spend about $12, 39 more than today.
Wal-Mart's defenders point out that the protest was held in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage.
"Black Friday" in stores, the company said Thursday from 8 p.m. until midnight the following day, and during this period, the company sold about 5,000 Walmart items of goods per second.
Overall, the Treasury carried out in the "Black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.
The company's representative Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post website that jobs out of a total of "less than five" employees of Wal-Mart, and that the protest was "all other media sensation," organized by trade unions.
"Vacant Treasury!"
The protests have continued this week in New York, where they were trading houses to Walmart (those in that pokrokovém town is not very popular, and therefore there are almost), but "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that sells billion servings of, and then you or paid sick leave and not properly you for your hard work.
Jumaane Williams, a member of the city council in New York City
Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal law and with the regulations of the State of New York 7.25 dollars an hour.
Fastfoodové restaurant this wage increase gradually, but only slightly, and on average they receive their rank-and-file workers in New York 8,90 dollars per hour.
No one in this expensive city, lower wages.
Well, I don't see how you can be in New York for that kind of money.
Employment in the "McDonald's" almost a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the counter part-time after school and live with their parents.
Few people in that sees its main source of livelihood or plans to stay there for a long time.
At present, I kept in an interview with the workers' McDonald, who complain that it must live on this money, and sometimes even to feed their children.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal's comment, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how you feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 in the morning on Thursday at the "McDonald's" unusual Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cash and cooks in fast-food companies began to receive at least $15 per hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
It also demanded that fast-food were based in the sphere of trade unions.
American laws forbid the administration to prevent the formation of trade unions and to punish the activists trade union movement bullying and layoffs.
On the other side of them administration rarely makes life easier.
In a fast-food companies, trade unions, however, it is difficult even for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is unusually high turnover of staff.
The opposition
On this day of noisy protests also were held in a number of other low-priced restaurants in Manhattan.
The event was the culmination of a rally at noon at the "McDonald's" near Times Square, where a number of local democratic politicians, in particular, the City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's," says that sells billion servings per day, and then you or paid sick leave and not properly you for your hard work! "
The demonstrators also have the support of other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must work together to support workers fastfoodů so as to achieve a fair reward for their work and economic prosperity they deserve every New Yorker!"
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast-food sector.
But it was attended by only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of fast food, in New York, which employ tens of thousands of people.
Whether this event will become the spark that ignites the flame of a mass movement, is still unclear.
"We are the brain to deceive the average."
Between the fans of modern technology of virtual reality is a popular topic of augmented reality; lately it means, in particular, to view the world through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference, Google has shown a working model of this news, and in November, it was announced that the application for the patent, as well as Microsoft.
In an interview with the leader of the group of interactive 3D technology in Microsoft's Cambridge laboratory Šaramem Izadim shows that the company's glasses for scientists are already a thing of the past.
The challenge is the prospect of handling of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating a virtual public spaces.
- Tell us in general, what it is doing your research group?
- We are dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity has stuck in stage work with pixels on a flat screen, the most ever touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensor - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without Kinect sensors, because for all is a very interesting possibility of proceeding with gestures.
- What is ahead of us in the future?
- Notwithstanding that brought the Kinect system interact on a physical level, very much interaction is still ongoing on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The flow of information to improve (the system) is a lot of data, but so far no output flow.
We are trying to change that, we are working on a three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projektivních.
The computer world is to be admitted into our physical world, make it more realistic.
To this end, however, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add to the real world of virtual objects in a much better form.
And in the first place - to hell with those silly helmets virtual reality.
- What do you think about the vocal control?
It is a popular thing, but does not exaggerate?
Of course it cannot be regarded as a panacea - raises the issue of privacy, because they do not always want to inform others in our neighborhood on their activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interactions with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for control devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not by the sweeping, only about such Tiffany, short.
The gesture would nesnímala camera equipment, but the bracelet to monitor the movements of bone and muscle.
There is great, but in theory, it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future of the mixed type of control, such as a gesture + voice.
- A how?
- How, for example, you ask me to give you this can of soda?
Say it, and at the same time you show.
- I usually just talking.
- Oh, it will be very difficult to identify.
- So you want to get the user to adapt to what at the moment may or may not machine?
- It is not necessary, but it is mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reaction.
It may, for example, be a laser scanner, which provide a good in-depth resolution, that is very important.
- If you have to talk about his work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your demands of modern cameras?
Today, it is not sufficient detail, depth or something else?
- In the nature of the current generation - that's what we can be reflected in our work on the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f / s.
But it is not just about the megapixels, but as the nuts and depth.
In the current view on the matter are insufficient for us all current technology - that's the trouble with algorithms.
So we have to bear in mind not only the distinction in the X and Y axes, but also.
So it is also very important speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic, and the current data flows of 30 frames per second are, frankly, a little bit, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond did touch sensor with adjustable delays in the processing of 1 to 100 ms, with the current, mass-produced scanners are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much it affects the human-computer interaction.
For me, it would be very useful in the work of the equivalent of such equipment, but I don't need so many touching, but I need some frames per second.
- A, increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- In the Kinect system are now used three cameras, one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second-set reflected signal.
And the third camera - that is, in fact, a visible sensor zone.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A greater number of cameras could potentially solve the problem.
Or worse, because it would increase the volume of the necessary calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play with the curve of the location of the cameras and see how it will help to determine the three-dimensional position.
- If I recall, Microsoft (unlike Google) not presented publicly his glasses.
You don't think in terms of day-to-day use of augmented reality technology using special glasses, this is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course to walk and constantly keep smatphone raised in hand is not very comfortable, but I think: The strongest option would be "portable" version of the reality, where it would be possible on the basis of the buiding switch anytime from his glasses on the smartphone screen display and around.
The glasses - this is a very personal devices, this is their strength (private things you only see you), and at the same time, the weakness - augmented reality on the basis of the glasses will not allow you to work on the virtual objects together with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man," but also ordinary mortal.
There is one problem, which critics often point: There is no tactile response.
Hands feels nothing!
What is your group is preparing a response to this challenge?
- In their lectures often say that augmented reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the mutual interaction between man and machine.
I think that the tactile qualities would have become the eighth breakthrough.
Meanwhile, is one of the interesting tricks - the use of second-hand as a kind of support for viewing.
Excellent records compression.
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding the solidity of these "in the air" - such as interference in a direction ultrasound beam defined point the finger, a tactile sense, but it is still very weak, as if you blew on his fingertips.
There is also a bracelet on his wrist, which affects the nerve endings in his fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
To think that's what it appears that he should feel at the moment, when they see something?
- It is a good idea, that we haven't tried yet.
There is yet another challenge that will fight long - how to get a man who is physically located in a cramped space to believe that is open, virtually infinite space - we are also working on the concept of cross-country trails (no such as in clubs), a moving platform, as well as the huge balls.
If the deception of the brain becomes the target, so the work is still for many years.
That's what he was doing work on the virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in the very early stages.
Vkusovština instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petrohradska avant-garde," dedicated to the people who are in the lead, are avantgardou culture and the arts.
At the top of the list were already significant figures of the art scene St. Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often located recognition in Europe, without reaching Všeruského reputation.
The new hero "Rosbaltu" is an amazing artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller, a bearded man who is dressed all in red, which you see here at the Russian Museum, here in the summer garden, in the fashionable pubs and vernisážích.
The images of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed to, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of a purely social and philosophical petrohradských storytellers, the creators of the new mythology.
Cyril Miller - this is a striking man St. Petersburg avant-garde end of the 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition to the city, his appearance on the streets of a smile on the face of the citizens, all in the mood.
Recently picked up an organ and became the Petersburg flašinetářem, because in this difficult role is ripe with all his bohémským life philosophy and image.
- Clive, why you're walking around dressed in red and yellow or, for example, in the turquoise?
- 'I have chosen the red color as designer dealing with light and image.
In this world is a red color of compromise between the artist, imagemakerem and the public.
While it is generally true that everything is just a little different from the grey, aggression and waking up bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed to be established.
The whole history of my provocative acts is an invitation to the debate.
- And when you understand that you have to be an artist?
- On the exhibition in the House of Culture on Nevsky Prospekt Station, where they were exposed to my work.
I understand what is my way.
Then came a wave of unofficial artists old and new, free of the artists I couldn't understand.
I made friends with a new wave of artists, with post-gazoněvskými, who brought us to the "puškinské 10," and the next wave.
This brings me to the theater, clothing, music, in all genres beyond words.
- A all merged in your art-clinic... - For me, it was important to be at the center of a culture of Petersburg, where should gather all the power of creativity.
In 1995, I took place at puškinské 10, and there before the reconstruction there was music and art club, a Bohemian Club, home of petěrburkské bohemian.
There was much: Nome, tequila Jazz, don't forget how Šnura brought to the project "Ears Van Gogh."
Šnur under the plywood and his friends sang a song, they dressed in tight-fitting trikotů, among them in the middle of the composer Igor the dowager's, who is now in vogue.
When the band began to play live, become the "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg led many programmes sworn-galivských times.
We gave them the Trachtěnberga, began his great career, basic education and training received from us.
The gallery "D 137," club "Griboedov - that is the aftermath of Art Clinic.
This way they left our workers and patrons.
I am a hero of the last century, when the culture still meant something.
In 2000, he organized the survey was in the press, the special price was "People in our city."
"The Artist of the Year" in the nomination I was appointed me, that ended my peak.
In the new times, according to the old rules of the work is unpleasant, I'm a man of truth, integrity and the culture of the last century.
In recent years, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity of today are different things, you may be popular, but not too much cultural.
- Your works are characterized by an identifiable manner.
- Many of my paintings are hits in which it is vividly captured the timeliness and the pervasiveness.
I have the exhibition "the Russian museum clowns."
The clowns are timeless categories.
Earlier, I had been social, today it is painful and awful.
But the clowns all the glamour, takes the tragedy.
I love the grotesque, I have a grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by way of totalitarian disguised in the regulatory system.
Today, people face in clothing, focusing on the external drive, not a single person.
Or maybe he could not shake hands and to be spit in his face.
And the change will be deleted.
- When we saw you in the role of urban flašinetáře.- Cultural city should have such a hero.
And who could it be, if not me?
- A may be commercial art fair?
- At present, it should be commercial, utility art thorough, tactful, sweet.
The collapse of the cultures.
In the past, people gathered in knots, La bohème loved one, free from other people.
Today, everything was broken on mikrospolečnosti, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not stodolarová bill, I liked it all.
Today, it is necessary to think about who likes.
Today, everyone has a cultural hero of their 100 fans.
- A Stasu Mikhailov comes several thousand spectators.
- On his fans will come, there had been involved sexually social sphere.
And the cultural soil will be 300 people and 10 thousand of them, and the result is less management, money, everything is failing.
I have the fans, the main thing is that no one is fooled and not what is ingrained.
When I was young, I was painting such images, which in one collectors hung on the wall, along with Falkem and Larionovem.
I started with the images, which most people.
Today, people often mistaken concepts.
They say the culture minister, the culture of the consumer.
There is no culture of consumer, it is elsewhere.
I am a man of culture of the previous day, I grew up with examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money because of the drawing pictures.
And I'm for such a culture.
- Clive, what is in Petersburg lack?
- Dobrých experts on culture.
There is such a concept: Churchman over the culture.
Not all of them, but can deal with the culture.
In times of ordinary Tsars, it wasn't in all the Tsars may be too didn't understand the culture, but understand that it is necessary to support the real experts.
In Moscow today are good consultants.
In St. Petersburg, we have people who could be experts, but they are kept out somewhere in a corner, because they are a great experts who correctly appreciate these experts and state is on the right path.
Today thriving vkusovština.
The same Erarta, but, frankly, saying that not everything we modern art, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What is it you Petěrburk?
- Petěrburk - it's Capital of Culture, in Moscow, there is far more culture, there is the right soil.
And on our waste, the art of doing poorly.
We need a cultural ground, but for us today is writers more than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, it is very many people who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
For us, it is a layer of a weak.
We need to make art has become fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is being implemented for the grant St.Petěrburku
Born in the universe
The country is in danger.
The global warming or collision with the killer asteroid.
The caravan of space ships with them on board on a journey, searching for a replacement of the planet.
To save humanity, the question arises: How to keep his house in conditions of weightlessness, or to the replacement of the planet?
I think that the choice is not a great.
In fact, there are only two planets, which it is possible to adopt, if only hypothetical.
"It's Venus and Mars," says a senior researcher of the National Astronomical Institute P. K. Šternberga (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
While there are better conditions for life on Mars, on the surface of Venus, the temperature to 500 degrees Celsius.
It is only possible to live at high altitude or in orbit around Venus... in the universe.
To address the issue of reproduction in the universe, scientists began with flora.
For half a century ago, attempts have been made on the plants.
The four generations of peas grown in orbit around Earth are no different from their relatives.
It was then carried out the insects in orbit - a very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979, was sent into space quail's eggs, to determine how the developing embryo in microgravity.
We are absolutely normal output of the bird.
But then start to problems.
"There is a problem with the fact that this bird has to find support, it must stand on its own feet and start to move," said the head of the Laboratory Institute biomedicínských problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev.
If they don't support, the birds chaotic fall and somersault.
After 10 hours, occurred in the newly hatched birds to a complete cessation of instincts.
The birds did not respond to light and sound.
And the problem was that just died in four days.
"Twice we left turn into birds, but then we rejected it, because it is simply impossible to work with them," commenting on the failure of an experiment with chickens in the universe Vladimir Syčev.
The last "miniarcha" with animals flew in orbit 16 years ago.
Experiments in the spring of 2013 will continue.
In biosatelitu "Bion" but will only being one sex.
He ran the experiment with rats who were broadcast into space already pregnant.
In fact, they found nothing supernatural.
"It was only on biosatelitech, but again, this is a unique experiment and such attempts should be implemented," said Vladimir Syčev.
After landing on the ground, the space rats born offspring.
Approach to the problem of reproduction directly in the universe, however, so far failed.
It is a difficult task.
Animals at the loss of the normal environment simply cannot carry out its sexual instincts.
The man, unlike the animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens is an abstract thinking and is able to create a corresponding emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not.
But the women fly into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger threatened Tereshkova's.
The most precious thing that humanity has is a woman's body.
Our Chaika, and no one on Earth could not say whether the last flight into space.
Whether it will be able to bear a child after such a flight.
"I still have no answer to that question," says the veteran-space sector Vakhtang Vačnadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, gave birth to the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova daughter.
The father of the child was also an astronaut Andriyan Nikolayev.
In 1988, he was born the son of a second wife-kosmonautce Svetlana Savické, which visited orbit twice and who also worked in an open space.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few of the astronauts, which after years of birth and grow the health of children.
"Moreover, it can be dangerous, even when the orbital flights," says astronaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and the Hero of Russia's Valeri Polyakov.
Yet humanity must inevitably find new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and creating artificial gravity.
Hydrolaboratoř CPK is a stage of preparations for the flight.
Here in terms of zero gravity, the astronauts learn the skills needed to work in an open space.
The water mimics weightlessness.
Even though the water is even comfortable for adults, but in a strange environment for small children is a natural element.
Small ichtiandři seems to confirm that life on earth originated from the ocean.
There is a link between the child is at an average of nine months in his mother's little water and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing, is only two weeks.
"It's very little to the child had been forgotten," says Marina Aksenovová infant swimming instructor.
In short, if it is for a newborn baby weightlessness more natural state, then for women is more natural inevitable gravity, the attraction.
In microgravity is very quickly to the wasting of abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pelvis, decreases the body's ability to expel the fetus.
We can leave aside, if they work promoters muscle activity in childbirth.
After all, it is possible that the birth took place in a special chamber in which the body of the mother expelled the fetus.
"What next?" Asks Valeri Polyakov difficult questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
In the absence of gravity on the body, not the right to form the skeleton or a set of muscles.
The newborn in orbit, it is not possible to wear as an adult in a suit with a burden, in which he could coach.
They will be deprived of what needs to develop unconditionally.
"If you go to the experiment, which allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we'll bring a disabled person on Earth, which will be absolutely nepřizpůsobená our environment," says the Commission on Bioethics IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.
So the children born in space today is only a theoretical question.
However, once the time will come when it becomes a reality, and when the issue in their ships to a faraway place, which will become the home of their offspring born in space.
The head of the OWLs: Control švarcsystému failed because of politicians
The Czech Republic has good in connection with public procurement supervisors and the quality of the legislation, but lags behind in its application.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz. says the vice president of the Supreme Audit Institution Miloslav Kala.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that's what we believe is missing," commenting on the current situation of Kala.
Similar conclusions also suggests the joint control of the Czech and German controllers.
As an example of the wrong practice says Petr Nečas access to the so-called "švarcsystému."
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP will not bother him checks entrepreneurs - it is banned or permitted?
"The law must be set up, and if something from, you can prevent nor Prime Minister in the activities of the office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce the obligations," says Kala.
At a meeting of the committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you are talking about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany, which was compared the legislation on public contracts in both countries.
What exactly was it?
It is a parallel control, which we took off about two years ago.
Put simply, the European legislation regulates how public procurement contracts, followed by the various national legislations and then also the experience.
We put all this together, and even if the check is not yet closed, showed us a very interesting differences - generally speaking, the legislation is even "more and more sophisticated," however, the practice is in some respects better in Germany.
Thus, it is confirmed that it is not enough to create still more precise rules on and on, but there is a need to deal with the application of the law.
What do you do this project can help, what it means for you?
Such a joint control could contribute to efforts to stop the refining the laws, reducing and improving the limits, if it does not have a positive impact.
Economy means to obtain the proper thing for a reasonable (but not always the lowest price), in order to avoid the enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But, by reducing the limit of the contracts that don't necessarily achieve.
Maybe the system into a "paper" that those who want to look for the holes in the system, so they will draw a lot easier than if the limit is higher.
You're talking about domestic problems in passing legislation on public procurement into practice.
How does the control system in Germany?
There is a similar to our OWL office, or is it set up differently?
What the authorities concerned, as well as OWL Bundesrechnungshof works there, which is organized as we also has a college, just a little differently, but fundamentally both offices doing likewise.
Also powers are similar to a certain extent, but the fact that Germany has a federal structure, so has the following the courts and at the level of the individual Länder - that the system is a little different from ours.
BRH can only control of the federal money, represented by the state resources.
Public funds, which are managed by the county, the municipalities, there are from the level of the federal courts.
As the legislation, so that it is easier than ours?
In general, I would hate it without specific data, however, in some respects, Germany is described as a model, but I cannot say that it is in all the better.
It is therefore necessary that they have better inspectors?
Certainly not, but I say again, I don't like such comparisons.
But it has to be said that the country, which we consider to be a model, are faced with a wide range of issues.
Otherwise, there was no benefit for them to cooperate with our office, isn't it?
With regard to domestic legislation, what was your office for the amendment of the Public Procurement Act, there are already some of its effects?
Given that the duration of this amendment is relatively short, so we still in control of events shows.
Because we are ex-post controls, it is to be expected with some delays.
So far, only that we are in the process of preparing future checks - we started our new instrument, the risk of detection "inefficiencies" through which we run almost 14,000 public procurement, and we've analyzed it - there is, of course, those changes will be, because their limits, the conditions of certain types of competition, and so on.
The approval of this law, it is more for the benefit, or the additional burden of bureaucracy?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that will confirm this.
The problem here may be that she "will tighten the rules" and will not be respected.
Under the previous rules are controlled by a person committed by the (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes Regional Council) to ensure that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement is a violation of budgetary discipline.
Therefore, the price of the law tightening in this way?
I think not in this way.
The system shall exclude those who want to attack him and abuse, and not to punish those who commit formal misconduct, which does not have an impact on the decision-making.
Such a system will create more pressure on the red tape.
And how it out?
Let us show the way.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP will not bother entrepreneurs controls on the so-called "švarcsystému" - and what does that mean?
Švarcsystém is banned or permitted?
The law must be set up, and if something from, you can prevent nor Prime Minister in the activities of the office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce the obligations.
He can say: "We will change the law and allow it," but I can say that we are going to do anything like that.
In the public procurement law are relatively strict rules about what is to be done formally - which is right to protect the public.
But on the other hand, it is a tragedy when the candidate with the best bid is excluded for formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be correct its application - that's what we believe is missing.
The roads are icy in spots, but mostly passable
In several places in the Czech Republic are icy and snow-covered roads.
But most of the roads are passable, somewhere with caution.
Karlovarský the region
In the Karlovy Vary region this morning, the roads were passable, but also the snowy and icy.

Shimon Ornest: We want to accumulate positive energy at concerts
What do you think about the fact that he has come in less than a month the end of the world?
This is just one of the more alarmist, which we humans like to catch.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we are doing more fun and we say that we're the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to the end of the world, delayed or prevented.
In December, moreover, there will be a unique project three concerts at the end of the world.
Can you imagine him closer to readers?
It is a national fund-raiser, which we are planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21, at 11: 10 in the morning.
The day before, 20 December from 9 p.m. to 3 will take place simultaneously concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
Some will end up at a time when Kiribati on the island in the Pacific, which is in the time zone for 12 hours ahead of us, Maya calendar.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally, it was about my idea, then we are all up together with our artist John Augusta.
In addition, we want to amass the positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we are also, together with the public to think about the condition of one of the world to our children.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of objects of shoes, shirts, bags or original germ against the end of the world whose buying at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The group The Tap Tap, together with other performers also sang the national anthem at the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World canceled."
It is very popular on YouTube, will also be on the charity concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, if we succeed, and the end of the world does not.
All the performers sing it at all three concerts in parallel.
The anthem is a link in a unique live on Czech television.
He wrote the words to the song and the role of Jesus in the clip plays Tomas Hanak, sings in her also Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We are also working with other members of the Czech cultural scene, given that we have a lot of charitable events and concerts.
We're trying to engage in these projects is.
It turned out that most of them are interested in working with us and enjoy.
What will the proceeds from the concerts against the end of the world?
For the fitting of an accessible training centre Studeo, which was the sixth year we s občanským sdružením Tap in Jedličkově Institute.
The school's students are regularly Jedličkova teachers and give them in activities, which is fun and interest.
Students themselves do not have the means to go for the teachers themselves, we are trying to allow them in this way.
In the construction of the Jedličkova Institute in the future, there will be a separate building into which we move with this project.
At each concert will be several musical groups and artists.
According to what you choose?
We tried to draw up a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague out Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango, Jiří Suchý.
You learn all the details to www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning a similar "bombastic action" in the future?
In May, we will for the first time at the Prague Spring, so there will certainly make an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to play in the Czech National house in New York, and I personally, when we are in the US, I would like to integrate with the speech in Washington and in Chicago.
Your foreign plans are minimalist, yet you were, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London, or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, a group of disabled people. "
How the way you logistically and organisationally?
It's not as bad as it first appears.
We have five members in an electric cart, its trucks to travel in the baggage compartment, and, of course, vláčíme large quantities of cargo and boxes of tools.
However, so far it's always handle without problems, CSA and British Airways were well prepared for us, I wondered how many times before.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was no problem.
Thanks to výjezdům abroad you can compare how individual differences in bezbariérovosti, public access to hendikepovaným and the like.
What you have not yet met?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than for us, we're in Russia have seen that in the East, everything is still in full beginning.
In Prague, Moscow is a barrier, there is still unusual for a man in an electric wheelchair himself was in the city centre.
There is no such obvious, as you prefer to be wheelchair in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are civic associations, which tries to draw on the problems of people with disabilities.
And on the contrary, we still need to catch up with the more advanced countries?
There are a lot of things in which we are still lagging behind.
But it is important to note that the improvement and improving the situation is always depend on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite normal that people with severe learning self in public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, everywhere.
But it is very normal that a large number of people with disabilities actively participated in social life, in that we have with The Tap Tap slightly ahead!
Respect for the public or a bezbariérovost is one thing, but only when one of us will be prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things start to change.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The band The Tap Tap are currently very popular, but a few years back what you in 1998 to set up her?
I got a tutor to Jedličkova Institute, where I was around a lot of young people who were interested in something to do.
And since I am a musician, playing the saxophone, among other things, so I, together with my colleague founded the extracurricular musical circle.
Well, and over time, as our host Láďa Angelovič, a little out of hand (laughter).
But the popularity came up in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that helped us when we started to connect with known singers and also actively work to promote the band.
We're out of that work, which is not visible, in essence, as if there was.
Thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford high-quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
It was your goal to go to The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential of the fact that we can do something different.
Showbusiness's crowded things where one mimics the other.
In a way, it is logical, everything is taken care of new and it takes a long time.
The things that are unique, there is very little, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who can see us for the first time, it is, of course, regret, it's natural.
But the regret is totally unnecessary, because people with learning disabilities are not suffering from all the things that we have to regret.
These are the people who can live a full life and develop, assuming, of course, that they have the means to do so.
I say that if something can people with learning, so it is not only shift for them, but for the whole of society.
This success has helped, too, that you have a hard taskmaster, as many people as you?
If we want to do a good job, we must be firm in many cases, and require some discipline.
But I think it is perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic notion, and with his head in the clouds, and when he finds that it has twice a week to go to test the product and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, so it's enthusiasm quickly.
But the way it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
Currently, the band The Tap Tap 20 members.
How many of them were at the beginning in 1998?
Only one Láďa Angelovič.
We are open to a group, people are leaving and coming, that can't be avoided.
Who has the will and desire, is always open the door
The day before the expected at the end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9 p.m.
Incheba Kalfus will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava form recently with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three of the city at the end of the evening linking telemostem singing songs in the band The Tap Tap "End of the World canceled."
The aim of the concert is to collect funds for equipment, a training centre in an accessible STUDEO Jedličkově Institute in Prague in the volume of 25 million CZK
Tickets to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 years of age are free entrance tickets v předprodeji Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week at a meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency accepted Poland for the 20th member of the European Space Agency, like other countries of the former Eastern bloc countries (in the Czech Republic, which is a full member of the ESA's 12 November 2008).
Poland, a close cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and over the years have been involved in a number of projects, the agency.
However, Poland's path to space began much earlier.
Flights into space is devoted to Polish enthusiasts before the Second World War; but not always met with understanding.
I, for example, a lecture A. Šternfelda in the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, 6 December 1933 represented the thoughts of his pioneering work Entry into space.
The idea of a young engineer (born in 1905) left audiences cold and after years of Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 he Šternfeld for Entry into space in France, the Robert Esnault-Pelterieho and André Louis Hirscha.
Dr. John vzpomenutý Gadomski (1899-1966) and later became a promoter of astronomy and space.
The Polish magazines published hundreds of articles and has written a number of books devoted to the scientific disciplines.
Gadomski, a world-known promoter of space and his contribution was recognized that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named on his behalf.
In 1925, was built in Poland rolling the car, which should be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and are not known, the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to take the trolley or its application.
Information about the handcar dobového are known only from the press.
Since 1933, the rocket missiles began to deal with the Polish artillery.
The research was Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professor Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the writings of the materials, it is clear that research has reached a stage prakzických tests.
However, the arrival of German troops research was interrupted.
In 1937, the proposal appeared in academic journals photovoltaic the interceptors designed by engineer Rohoziński and the following year she work Rakieta - Torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza author Leliwy-Krzywoblockého.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all the projects of the military use of rocket technology to the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) to coordinate all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of his work ended the war.
Further work on the space after the war in the Polish press, thanks to the work of the astronaut (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, the company is mentioned in the November issue of the class of 1954 magazine issues in which there are four more extensive articles on astronautics.
In one of them, from Professor M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a company that will deal with space.
By that time, running projects of artificial satellites and it was clear that space research is promising field.
Since the beginning of the year 1956, the Polish astronautická company (PTA) snažia for accession to the International Federation of Astronautics (1951) and now based in the autumn, the PTA became a full member.
And in the following year, the first president of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) became a vice-president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
This he held until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA significantly contributed to the development of a very successful meteorological rockets RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket, which carried out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place 10 October 1958.
The rocket with dostupem 1800 meters was about 80 cm and it weighs less than 5 kg.
Later, it was built by an improved version of the RM-1A and in the summer of 1959 were launched in the desert Bledovské flight tests of two-stage rockets RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long, and her weight was about 11.5 kg.
Further development of the type we should be able to actual scientific work - the RM-34 should have a ceiling to 14.5 km and its mission was monitoring the height of the wind.
However, in 1962, was suspended for further development.
The heir to the first rocket-RM became the missile Meteor-1 offers from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-layer, its overall length was 510 cm and starting weight was 32.5 kg.
There have been three types of (the Meteor-1A, -lb and -1c) different sizes of space for scientific instruments.
In the missile Meteor-1A was available space on the volume of 0,4 litres, Meteor-1B of 0.34 litre and Meteor-1C of 0,62 litres.
The maximum altitude for all three types of was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 was v Leteckém Institute of development of missile Meteor-2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The missile Meteor-2 was starting weight of 380 kg and was able to deliver a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
They were built version of the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
Still, it is important to mention Poland's entry into the COSPARu (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later.
Poland is also under the Intercosmos involved in research into space on a Soviet-made satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after Vladimir Remek became the second interkosmonautem.
The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court to annul the law on public works.
The resolution has caused the public a lively debate.
Certainly, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that the individual economic departments, national economic systems, are in permanent conflict between them.
This is the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the significant differences in the cost of labour (wages), the price of tension.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation where the manufacturer is trying to imports of low-priced goods to compete in that "you" price competitor in order to push for greater market share and thereby increase their profits.
On a massive scale, it means for most entrepreneurs either translate production abroad, or buy cheaply, or zaniknout.Výsledkem is high unemployment in countries where prices are the work of high compared with other economies.
Because the private capital has no social responsibility and accountability for it produced unemployment, rising social spending in the state.
The situation underscores the reluctance of businesses to pay taxes and to replace a national economic and social damage done in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to give specific figures.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital in individual economies are creating a situation where governments are forced to join the competition in order to artificially reduce the welfare of his own people in order to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments are private capital to its own people, regardless of social decline.
This is reflected in the amendments to existing laws.
The aim is to make its own population adopted a price dictates of private capital, particularly in the areas of wages.
This is happening on the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and limiting the rights of workers in the field of employment law.
The result is a growing poverty, together with the increase in the gap between rich and poor.
In Germany, there are already a number of years of public ticket of food for the poor who cannot feed their own work.
The number of these people are already in the millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy is routinely to cases that have employed people receive a salary, that they must pay to the breadline.
But the scandal was published, and in the case of auxiliary staff of the federal parliament.
The austerity measures virtually all of the southern EU states quite clearly lead to the same state where people are under pressure from the catastrophic collapse of social level either forced to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to be preserved for starvation wages on the fringes of society in the hope that it will come into the country, the private investment capital.
But there is a need to ask where it comes?
If it will be from other EU countries, then moves poverty from one country to another, or not at all, because the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or Turk Marokánec, or Egyptian, or African still work for a fraction of the European wages.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
The liberal theories and the media to claim that the state cannot participate in the capital on its own economy that controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private equity stubbornly insists on the opinion that the state should not interfere with the intervention in the economy.
Then there is need to ask whether private equity does not affect, now governed by the policy, and that the entire state in their own egoistickém sense.
There is a clear answer yes.
Evidence of the existence of a virtually all-powerful and ubiquitous in all states.
The result is a desperate situation, manifested in the area of corruption, providing reciprocal benefits law, where it is practically everything reprehensible, but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that the State Department for lack of funds awarded the drafting of laws by private companies, which are often in conjunction with the industry.
These bills are then agreed in the Bundestag.
All the power that comes from the people as they say Western-style constitution, but from a financially strong groups preferujících their own interests.
It is clear now that the liberal-oriented democracy is rapidly moving into the situation, as she describes in his book The Appiános Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompeia: "The state had long been in full decay and authorities took over the violence.
For bribes, illegal acquisition of patronage and with stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any hindrance and people went to the polls with pre-sold voice... "" men of character of the neucházeli at all, so that once was as a result of this disruption was standing eight months without consuls.. "." It is, indeed, to talk about the fact that the only medicine in a bad situation is samovláda and that it is necessary to choose a vigorous man. "Appiános had thought of Pompeia, but he had become Caesar, who changed to take democracy for self-rule.
Conclusion As in antiquity, the current company is based on a preference for their own benefit, regardless of the society's interest.
Private capital is not inherently able to understand and apply the benefit of society.
The result is now, as then, the unprecedented decadence elites, without any efforts to reform more profound.
The causality onset of fascist and communist regimes, so we have to look at the indiscriminate liberalisation of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of these systems can be in favour of the type of liberal democracy as a break with the expectations of the next round.
In particular, the disastrous is the fact that the elites in the future be completely ignore the possible loss of lives, the humanitarian and social disaster, which we've already witnessed with crimes against humanity as we know it from the old and new history.
The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of competition both at international and European level Interior of the Czech Republic, the government will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the welfare of the population.
This trend is therefore the system.
The solution is targeted politicko- social reforms that will strengthen the state capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens in the government, and will weaken the monopoly position of private equity in the company for the benefit of the country.
Israel: The chaos.
"Nothing would come of violence, nor can never" Sting in the song Fragile whose main line in the chorus, "let us not forget how we're fragile."
"If my sons don't want war, there would be no" dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Rothschild Amschela in 1849
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there was a lot of reaction.
One is for Israel, they argue that the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians belongs to the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians argue the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide perpetrated by the Palestinian Arabs and the State of Israel belongs to the role of a terrorist state.
I don't want to think about it, who is guilty of killing periodically repeated waves of victims and who, after all, the people of Israel, including the self-governing territory, born in the current political situation and the beginning of violence experienced.
My point is to offer readers a peek behind the curtain, the sight of who serves mainly already 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of land in the Middle East.
Some of my thoughts are supported by the available historical facts, some of them are based on the basis of my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of events of modern history.
The history of humanity is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can trace some of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether it has always been the personality, which completely autonomously governed by their actions, or whether someone was standing behind the throne, who directed the actions to advance vytýčenému goal.
We have to admit that we live in a time when the world is zkoncentrováno wealth in the hands of a few and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could occur in the life of a generation.
Among those astronomically rich families is one, which could be regarded as the head of an octopus (if there was one of them, I don't know, but I do not exclude that) - Rothschieldové.
Say much about them.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) has already bought in the 1990s, the 19th century to stop associating his name with a highly criminal acts, which stood in the background and it always meant a consolidation of power, the proliferation of wealth, or both.
The shares in almost all of the world's central banks and against countries where shares in the Central Bank have or are preparing to lead Afghanistan war (against an attack that was 7 countries after invading Iraq was 5 of the country after the overthrow of the Gaddafi's only four, but in the meantime, Russia had been subordinated to the central bank of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to resist the family, died.
Abraham Lincoln Rothschieldově refused to renew the status of Central Bank, Bank of America, during the civil war began to issue their own (the government's) money, and he was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began to issue their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, was murdered by 1963, a member of Mc Fadden Louis in 1936 was poisoned after he wanted to sue the Fed for starting the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power has led in 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars of a Mason, the 33rd degree of dedication Albert Pike.
The first war to remove large monarchistické state units in Europe, the second was removing the colonial mansion in Great Britain, and the third is to lead to a reduction of the world's population at 0.5-1 billion people (so many slaves for their comfort and luxury, and do not consume too many resources), the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a fertile ground for such a solution) and the end of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families in the lead with Rothschieldy works is causing the crisis and the subsequent offering solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos.
But these solutions are false, and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed, in order to avoid a crisis like the one in 1907).
So after they managed to assassination of the heir to the imperial throne-U R Ferdinand in Sarajevo to unleash the First World War, Czarist Russia destroyed by the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended a sudden, militarily and economically unjustified, the surrender of Germany (there was no need for a war for the destruction of Czarist Russia) and then the fragmentation of the European powers, Austria, Hungary.
To facilitate the release of the Second World War, let the bankers policy to create a latent conflict situation, Germany imposed a huge war reparations, which created a presumption of radicalisation's impoverished masses, and then they had to do was to give the Germans a sufficiently strong, identifying the culprits and simple solutions offering leader and the creation of a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority who should play, and I played, the fifth columnists, sparking a fire.
At the end of the nineteenth century Rothschieldové prompted the establishment of the Zionist movement, whose one branch to the creation of the Jewish state, not preferentially in the history of Judea, with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
Already the Balfourova Declaration, a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population.
The terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The outbreak of the Second World War, Hitler off the chain, which kept him at first international bankers, or what was in the plan, it is difficult to estimate, but the suffering of European Jews in concentration camp set a precondition for the acceptance of the Jewish state of the world community.
Officially, Israel was founded in 1948 and, like the war reparations Germany 2.světovou off to war, the state of Israel was created an outbreak of war in the third.
If it can unleash international bankers, the Jewish people, like the other victims in the front line of fighting, now jointly with the Arab or Muslim population in the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, the source of conflict and chaos, not only within the country, but also internationally (consider just how sharply divided between supporters and opponents of the people of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds wrong in an endless chain of violence, when it stood at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
There is a need to distinguish between the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as with us, had decided to international bankers on people's choice in the elections only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of fašizujícího, international bankers loyal, a politician who is doing all it can to start a war with Iran, which would have given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatened to escalate into a global conflict and given over moving through the control of Iran, which travels 20% of all the world's oil shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy.
In the light of what is now the words uttered by David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order."
A new world order in their vision is the world masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
The world, where each of the newly born individuals implanted in the birth of the chip that will make totally controlled.
"And they're all big and small, rich and poor, free and slave labor, to have the right hand or forehead brand to buy or sell, who is not marked on behalf of the beast, or the number of its name.
It is important to understand: Who has the sense to combine the numbers of the beast.
This number indicates the man, and that number is six hundred and sixty-six. "
The movie Argo: When is the worst call Hollywood
In November 1979, demonstrators occupied a crowd of Islamist students the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They should be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Rézu Pahlavi, who fled to the United States after the Revolution, the patron saint of his regime for several decades.
The situation for the US administration offered a positive way - to throw overboard Shah couldn't afford, because it would fundamentally undermines confidence among allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, has not been able to reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later compounded the fiasco of trying to free the hostages by force.
The detention of the diplomats were eventually released after 444 days after negotiations brokered the Algerian government.
Their plight has sparked a wave of solidarity at home and protiíránského sentiment.
The debacle in Iran has significantly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film režírujícího actor Ben Affleck's Argo describes one episode in the history of America has brought a small victory.
Just before the occupation of the embassy have fled from her six employees.
After the complex business ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to get them from Iran, has helped the extravagant a cover story - went to the Canadian passports as members of the film crew, who in the country surveyed the location for filming the sci-fi epic.
The combination of genres
The plan, which was invented by an expert on "exfiltraci" Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
The legend was credible, on a film project in specialized journals, held a press conference, a production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were classified for a long time, the film is based on memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck film is a strange combination of more genres.
On the one hand, realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time, the so-called "right movie," the story during a piece, foul play - for example, a series of Danny's teammates.
In the film, the mood turns - on one side of the documentation or evidence on the concept of a sequence of Tehran (titulkové sequence of events are shown ikonické photographs and the way they were in the same situation presented in the movie - big differences in that are not).
On the other side of the lightweight passages from Hollywood, covered with irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then there was the scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions -muži in suits are discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of the phone.
Ben Affleckovi is remarkably successful restart a career.
From vysmívaného actor became a respected director and his acting ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
ARGO is his third feature film, after the Czech Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
It is also the first Affleck picture, which is not taking place in režisérově home Boston.
A feel for the atmosphere of the place, one of the characteristics that warned older films place over the Hollywood standard.
He and Affleck in Argos, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scene in the movie is taking place in the streets, while rekonstruování real events - the opening sequence of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, who also conveys emotion confusion and nepřevídatelnosti that arise when a move out of history.
A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are in scenes contrived (false staff at teheránském bazaar).
Too many times in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that told the story, in fact, does not offer much in the film of exciting scenes.
Quite successfully, it almost works, sometimes to the reality of something přimyslí - there's not all so elegantly (a scene in which the looming crisis on teheránském airport refused to call in America and chase down the runway is too far-fetched).
But the weakness of the Argo ramblings arising from the need to show too many times in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues are very charming, but their figures would have more space and are not in the movie is far from the only.
Affleck film loses a little bit of a dramatic move, it's a picture, which can be monitored with mild interest, to evaluate the implementation of the retro style evocative thrillers of the 1970s.
But hard to push.
As a reminder of a sort of living history as well as proof of how much they are images of allpowerful and vševědoucích secret services, but will suffice.
The rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which publishes an annual survey of the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to declare the "absurd regulations or ideas from the EU."
"That led us to this last event when the EU plans to adopt 40procentní quota for women in the leadership of the large European companies," said Patrick Nacher Právo organizer of the survey.
The nominees absurditami is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of the unification of premium rates for men and women.
So far, the women were in the prices of life insurance beneficiary, because they are less risky for insurance companies objectively.
"Another incredible ideas from the EU, people can nominate by the end of this year.
The vote will take place by the end of February 2013, "said Nacher.
Among the controversial EU regulations are even mandatory admixture of biofuels into the fuel, which is harmful to the environment as a result of the ban on the use of mercury thermometers reliable because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or about the size of a hen s cages, which this year is significantly more expensive eggs.
Also faced criticism before the de facto ban on the use of the term pomazánkové butter or removal of incandescent bulbs from the sale.
High-quality bananas have 14 inches
The camera is often under the pressure of this or that commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels usually defend a state or group of states (and the Czech Republic now and the threat of a veto by the requirements of their banks).
The interests of the lobby, as well as for the fact that, for example, the highest quality bananas in the Union consists of at least 14 cm and could not be "anomalous twist."
The European Commission is hindered by the fact that only harmonises the uniform national standards, which complicated trading.
Rules on fruit and vegetables have softened over the opposition of some EU states, pointing out that the existing Directive lead to food waste.
A candidate for victory in the poll may be the last year's EU regulation, which must be sold balloons in mandatory warning that children under the age of 8 years may not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU's appeal to the American research, according to which the balloons are the leading cause of death among children's toys to suffocation.
Similar restrictions now pays for children up to 14 years in blowing into the carny frkaček.
Quaint ideas are born and at home
It is quite absurd and rule on the European officials - anyone who has an official role in the EU, with regard to the sensitivity of the topic for the use of the name Macedonia and Greece must instead to talk about the FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire put forward in the polls, in addition to some of the above absurdities even EU regulations on the volume of food supplies to the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set a maximum amounts of food supplies, which could be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
For example, the Czech Republic and then crossed the volumes of preserved mushrooms, for which he had threatened a large fine.
The organizers of the survey took the idea to pay for some of the countries that do not have the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies to the request to obtain subsidies.
However, these ideas not in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We're handicapováni that we don't have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for reimbursement, "he said in the autumn of 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As the argument that so many grain, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases should be full of warehouses, which had to be exported.
For the Czech Republic has continued to ports, according to the EU should Palase pay hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission turned out to meet the Czech Republic by a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy to obtain subsidies offered by municipalities, the Ministry for Regional Development Minister Pavel German (US-DEU), in particular should go to write applications for subsidies from Brussels.
The EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although the regulation in the Member States easily become the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and at the same time, a more efficient operation and development of the whole Union, according to a number of experts deserve more recognition.
A more serious problem, according to the experts, for example, the absorption of EU subsidies to projects that are not even a hint of something to do with the deepening of European integration, but which forced Member States in the budget negotiations.
Emotions among Czechs raises and that, as well as other countries of the European Union to the Czech Republic in Brussels to fight for the right to specific indications of their traditional products, and not always in this struggle will succeed.
The Czechs had a six-year battle with the Germans and Austrians strike indications of Olomouc cheese, but domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, for us, for our manufacturers to rename tuzemák.
The rum can carry only products made from cane spirit, and not from sugar beet.
In the EU's official list of registered products in the company of world-renowned feta cheese, Gorgonzola, marzipan from German Lübeck or Parma ham, for example, were already Karlovy Vary biscuits, Pohořelický and Třeboňský kapr and Žatecký chmel.
Mark the EU can also boast the Pardubice gingerbread and hořické tube.
People want to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, Okamura says
Senator, how a man that he wants to run for president?
It's not to be a senator or president.
If it worked in our country without any problems, so nekandiduji anywhere.
But I can't watch the last twenty years the country rozkrádá, as the thieves running, people are raising taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like it, so I'm trying to come up with a solution to change that.
And since I was 40, and I'm an independent nestraník, I have no choice, how things affect than to run for senator or president.
You got to the Senate, but then you started to the Castle.
Neotáčíte it back to the people who elected you?
I've said all along, that the fight for the Castle will go according to the outcome in congressional elections.
Later, I said that if I am elected senator, I will run for president.
My aim is not function, function is a tool, how can I carry out his vision.
That's why I need the greatest influence and what the strongest mandate.
But the problem is not just that, as a nation in the black and in front of the TV, but that trampling on anyone who wants to try to change.
Add to that the media, which man dehonestují and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For me, to be argued that uplácím journalists, or that I was adviser Jiřího Paroubka.
Let's go to your vision.
You have to fight for the Castle, the material and criminal liability of politicians and rear-view property returns over twenty million.
You have to change the law. "
But you don't have such powers as president and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws.
How do you want to?
When I, as a citizen lobbying to průvodcovství was free trade, managed to get it.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, is rejected, and that citizens.
As an independent nestraník I have far greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My priority is that without partisan categorization and dogmas I can take something that is best for our country, from each party and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more as a right-wing or left-wing?
From the point of view, it seems to me that people are more to the left.
For me it is not important, if a little to the left or a little to the right.
For me, it is important for us to go forward.
It's not about whether someone belongs to the left or right, but I want to bring people together.
Always I will support any public good solution, even though he will propose the Communist Party, or ODS, and so I'm going against a bad idea.
Čertíte when someone tells you that you are a populist.
But it interacted with what you said?
When you construct byznysplán in the company, and you have an ideal target and vision.
And you're trying to close.
Some may call it populism, but all proposals on which, in the world of work, or talked about them leading experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you would have just slogans.
And with that, in the long-term nevystačíte.
Or do you think that if you for people to walk and talk with them, that you can get, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have any choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on your side to push it.
If I was elected president, is not a problem to hold televised live, where I will ask the president of the parliamentary parties to enact the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they would eventually have to say why they did not want it.
If there is a strong personality, which will tell abuses, may be pushing on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was due to public pressure.
Frankly, I say that I am an amateur, that I'm not a genius, or an intellectual.
For his views and visions of trying to find allies.
In politics, I have only just begun, and for your program will try to get majority support.
The things I'm trying to push myself, if it doesn't, I will finish in six years and return to the private sector.
It sounds as if Okamura was to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that in one person to do nothing, so I walked around a number of well-known people, whether they would also stand as candidates for the Senate.
I went to Radimem Jančurou, that because of the amount of work he refused.
So I at least support the investigative journalist John Lorencovou which rozkrývala fraud, with light heating oil.
I ran with the fact that people are really unhappy, but now I'm in the balance.
Sixty percent of the people not to vote, and those who went, mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
The Senate navolili people so that it will be difficult to push changes.
Still, I'm going to fight for your vision, such as for the direct election of mayors or generals.
Are you considering establishing his own party?
I hadn't even thought about it, because I don't have time to check the net past any potential Party man, and I don't have the money.
I don't have the money or the presidential campaign, on my transparent account is only 20,000.
You don't have the money?
You're talking about property returns, what is yours?
The private property I estimate about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a parcel of land about 25 million, an apartment in ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art in about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Skoda Superb for a million, and then I have a couple of million in the account.
Aston Martin, by the way I have because it was my boyish dream - always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, he was courteous to women and at the same time, he fought against the wrongs and excesses.
Drive an Aston Martin, you have the assets for 60 million, and you don't have the money to the campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but much of their own money to give you.
It is not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million on the campaign.
To get into debt?
I bumped into the campaign for 2.5 million.
The fact that I have no sponsors, suggests that on my program might not be so interested.
And I don't have an obligation to pay from his campaign.
The cost of the campaign will cover me basically what I receive senátorský salary.
But I nevyžil from him, for example, I couldn't pay the son of an English school, which costs 30 grand a month.
I just wanted to make money, so nekandiduji anywhere.
So you're going to continue to do business, you can live?
Didn't you say that these activities utlumíte?
But that has nothing to do with the amount of salary.
As I promised, I'm part of their activities.
For example, a manager of the travel agency in the spring will be my representative.
People would like me to be Good Samaritan, which will save the Republic.
But I also need something to live.
How much are you as an entrepreneur was used to take a month?
Two hundred to 400 000, which I take on.
And if I were president, I would end my business.
The full interview can be found in the Saturday edition of The rights.
The architects MVRDV are proof that the real adventure are only in my head - for example, Spijkenisse and recently built a mountain of books -- 2 photos
"This building seems to me to be cheerful, looks futuristic. Finally, is once again to see something interesting," said Lisette Verhaig that goes over the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technician in the large enterprise, says: "Of course, the house is nice."
However, I wonder what today we need the library.
All have the Internet, iPady and electronic books.
In any of these libraries in the old-style today, nobody goes voluntarily or, yes?
Spijkenisse, in close proximity to Rotterdam without their own jobs that are not worth a visit, holds a special record.
This town of 80,000 people, the lowest level of education in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this silly situation, there were a few years ago, the decision to contribute to the education and build seven nicely painted miniatures of fictitious reinforced concrete bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes.
The success of the educational offensive but was less than glowing.
And so the city councilmen recognized that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: We need to have a library.
Winy Maas from Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of insanely courageous column graphs and the contractor of humorous, often even cynical buildings, accepted the case with the usual calm and competitive negotiations in 2003, with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the Commission still stunned, looking around and shrugged her shoulders, piling fresh Maas according to the size of their gifts for himself and his aktivisticky motivated speech ended with the words "Dear urban community."
This is my proposal for the mountain of books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain for 30 million euros stacked.
Revitalizačního is part of the project, which also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 flats.
In early November was a mountain of books will be honored the second place "Best Library of NL 2012."
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Small-town gray, which still could not offer more than postmodern pedestrian zone and extremely ugly Hall, whose white facade, you would expect more dairy is richer, thanks to a bit of contemporary architecture.
But, above all, is now the first public Spijkenisse cultural construction in the history of its existence.
A long journey to the book
The first impression: Reading the Eldorado under the cheese.
The middle of the mountains, while riding an elevator, but the real space and reading passion you find on foot to control the topography.
Of all the parties with the interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burning kabřince and elegant street lamps clearly express the spirit of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see a park bench, the dog and the boys and girls who play football.
And all the books, books, books.
"Normally there are shelves of books along the facade and is in the middle of a dark space, which is usually neútulný and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built a spatial configuration upside down and the space for the reader, we went up from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books is cleverly used: In the middle of the office, the library, the chess club, organic Centre and the operator of the technology.
The special comfort are black bookshelves, which are one lining the walls, once the sill and sometimes the railing of the stairs.
The appearance, structure and the smell of the eyes.
The unknown building material shaking their heads and even the bitterest architects and engineers.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project manager in the municipality of Spijkenisse, on the question of Standard.
And so we are in one fríském farm one day came across a waste product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands is used as a basis under the roots-millimeter webs of synthetic material.
Is a cheap and time-efficient.
Thin textiles will last one, two seasons, and then it is ready to blow up into a bulky waste.
For the library was the fleece - for the first time in such quantity - pressed down on the plate thickness of four inches.
The effects of the heat and pressure of the so-called Landbouwplastic (Commission on Human Rights) in the dark, homogeneous and zatížitelný material that smells like a new car and a bit like the sports shoes.
After 105 steps you get to the top.
At the end of the nearly 500 meters long journey will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only the fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquette and ficus trees in pots.
You take care of the atmosphere, but mostly about the humidity in the literature.
Gifts for a new soul
"I think you wouldn't believe, but this house is in spite of the many glass desktops a project, in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Vytápí and cooling the warmth.
Although the mountain of books standing under a glass dome, the sun shines in only briefly, and even in the sunny days.
The broad glued wooden beams, which is perpendicular to the glass facade, serves as a shield and pick up a large part of the solar radiation.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the will fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, an initial skeptic of the IT industry, already visited a new library.
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Also, a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who Boekenberg even referred to as "the long-awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
The reason: Each of the city a few weeks ago, he was invited to the opening to pay a book from his personal funds.
So should first be filled with optical gaps in not yet fully equipped library, which currently stands at 70 000 pieces.
The concept has proved.
The shelves are filled with.
"There is nothing worse than half empty library," says the architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, now has a new home each of a relationship.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for show.
This is MVRDV worked in the discipline, which is in a technical jargon says the formation of identity.
Spijkenisse said the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated.
It is, the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role."
Germany abstained in the decision-making on the adoption of Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe by Stephen Szaboa Berlin poised on a narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle, Germany at the beginning of the week, first suggested that he would vote against the proposal to the Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then the Berlin abstained from the vote.
Why? "
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, must be Germany because of their special relationship with Israel prudent.
But at the same time, I think I will not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, was too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
That ultimately put NATO.
It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, and that the direction of the policy, which has been run by the United States, so to speak, in the direction of German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are between the two lanes.
It is expected from them, that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think of setting up shop in its role as yet, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
On foreign policy, as in France or in Great Britain.
What exactly is "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?
It shows a willingness to take in the event of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, export and his relations with certain areas, like Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent, other than the economic interests of other nations, and that Germany must protect their interests.
Should the economic interests of the impact on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
Firstly, Germany has a large market in the Middle East, particularly in countries around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, they must be careful to discourage the public, but the elites in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I didn't want to give too much importance, it is not entirely one-sided relationship.
In any case, it plays an important role in the German considerations.
Damage Germany's relations with the US, Germany, in the case of two important decisions abstentions, for example, in the vote on Palestine?
I think in Europe and even in the US, there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position.
Therefore, I don't think it was such a dramatic break as in Libya.
Germany, perhaps even get some respect.
It indicates that it must be regarded as an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
In contrast, the US is clearly called for the veto.
There are between the United States and many European nations differences?
These differences existed as a result of America's internal politics.
I think that the Obama administration has probably secretly considerable sympathy for the European position.
But as a result of the political situation, of course, cannot hold this position publicly.
I think the difference of opinion is not as great as they always seem to.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu and Obama is not too excited Netanjahuovou policy.
It is not difficult for Germany to reconcile their close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and with the position of the EU's most important partners on the other side?
I think that's what makes it difficult for the Germans.
For Germans, of course, would be a little easier if there was a coherent and united European policy, which is currently the case.
They cannot be part of a broader line and must instead of pushing things forward on its own position.
That is just what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany would take a leading role in the future and will push Europe to the European position.
It is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
It has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself as a major international player, wants to take the lead role?
Or is it a leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, it's still uncomfortable, and for the country, for obvious reasons, it is still hard to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, as always, when Germany takes a greater role, creating the post of mood.
That the Germans, not easier.
It is an old problem: We don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable to all sorts of neighbors and views, and it is not easy.
The impact of the US in European politics now continues to decline, but the EU is currently not filled that vacuum. Who else is there?
The Germans simply will have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like it, it makes them feel uncomfortable, and it is even more neoblíbenějšími - c'est la vie!

"The protection of brands" in China: When the Puma and Armani suddenly Chinese
Armani's world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is Armani Polo?
It is the designation, which is not officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, enjoys protection as long as it is the real owners nezažalují brand.
And even then, it is not clear whether the amass.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect its brand in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the office of Taylor Wessing, which specializes in the protection of rights violations in the Far East.
Every week, lands on my desk a new case.
In addition, counterfeiters have had a few letters, so that they can make their own brands.
From Gucci, for example, will be Lu-Gucci and Prada have registered instead of Prada-Kyus.
In this way, they are legally copied and German companies, sporting-goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens the records of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
14 September 2010, left one Chinese company to protect the brand Zegna DF Puma. The name parazituje even at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are masters of the world in the copying and violations of intellectual property.
In large cities are multistory department stores, in which almost exclusively sell counterfeit.
But other cases are Pattlochovy. On behalf of their clients is opposed to Chinese firms have received from the Trademark Office, the right to use the designation, which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," the brand.
This word is focused on "Bang Dakuan."
This meant women who are rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It is damaging to business, we have to fight," invites Pattloch.
"Mark is diluted, exclusive position disappears, the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and the costs of the affected industries are in the millions, particularly in expensive sample products.
According to the market research for CLSA China with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, the third largest market for luxury goods and market, which is growing the fastest.
The deletion of dubious records in the register brands can be difficult to achieve, however, and that's worth something.
The procedure can stretch up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court has rejected the claim, because the name has contested after a long duration of the "market realities."
If the plaintiff has the misfortune plagiátorovi still has to pay for damage to its brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Well-known cases relate to the graphic elements.
In 2009, he lost Daimler legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery animals (goats, the company, which recently took over the German manufacturer Putzmeister pumps on the concrete mixture.
Therefore, the Chinese still may use the emblem, which is similar to the Mercedes star.
The company Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used blue-and-white logo, which resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
The manufacturer of the fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with the forgers of Hong Kong and Singapore, who known crocodile turned in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the 2.3 grade point CTMO admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 because of the very small number of staff and premises.
But in the last year, allegedly "the work of the emergency situation back to normal."
For example, the number of unprocessed of objections fell by 22 percent.
It was concluded, 57 000 of these cases, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still waiting for the office still 81 500 complaints pending.
To do something against it is expensive
As is often the case in China, it is an impressive numbers.
Last year it was CTMO delivered more than 1.4 million applications for protection of the brand, which is almost a third more than the year 2010.
It's a record, and it means that China is the tenth time behind a list of new applications in the world.
This is also true for the number of all existing trade marks - there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, the fees collected 1.8 billion yuan.
It simply means that each on the average cost 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
To start against the dispute is several times, as shown in the case of a German family business Freudenberg.
This group for more than seven years of fighting against Chinese plagiátorovi.
The Germans had achieved that was cancelled his illegal manufacture imitovaných car parts.
But the forger for China's rights to the mark Freudenberg continue.
We would be able to retrieve it, because in Germany last name cannot be protected, "says Hannah Wentzler, chairman of the company's management Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The 2.3 grade point CTMO then also rejected a Munich firm.
In two other instances, Freudenberg its rights, but the defendant in the case is further today.
It is necessary to take a careful
It is now a matter pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the case will lead to a good end and praised the professionalism of the courts.
But it also says: "The procedure is extremely expensive, and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the archives of the company had to even see a hundred years old files to produce evidence.
Five years ago, the company offered Freudenberg counterparty in vain "high six-figure sum in the euro" in order to settle the dispute.
"You can see what it means to us," says Wentzler.
There is a risk that the danger from the Far East and Europe will.
And that's when there are unprotected brand imitators.
One Chinese producer in Germany, for example, wanted to make the Freudenberg for footwear and leather.
This area of the business, the group had given up, he was able to avert the registration.
"It is necessary to be very careful," says Wentzler.
He and a lawyer Pattloch advises the German companies to be very cautious in trade with China.
It is not enough to rely on international známková. Foreigners would rather have "everything in any way is worth protecting, log on in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it may be much more expensive than the registration.
Indeed, if the company Freudenberg in the last act of the drama to the mark, then I will have to pay royalties for the opposing party's own name, explains Wentzler.
Or will be in the contested segment pushed out of the market.
World AIDS Day: The thumping, singing, aid
Tests in Heidelberg College Imbongi - and in Swaziland have joy orphans from parents who have died of AIDS.
The story, which is much more than 8733 miles.
First, there is the sound: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's shoes and men's shoes are looking for on the dance floor tact and it quickly.
The one-two-three-four.
Then slowly swell the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano, urging winning and mutually encounter.
29letého conductor Fiete Hopfa it almost rises from its textile shoes, combining the voices of his legacy of wild gestures.
It's Monday night in the music room of the Institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg Imbongi tested a new song.
It came to fifty singers and singers between 23 and 69 years ago, from the human genetics researcher at the porter.
"Om 'Obani" is not an easy piece, each choral voice has a different text and in a foreign language - Zulu, who is 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
The self-help aid
UNAIDS, the United Nations program to combat AIDS, estimates that around the world there are an estimated 34 million people who are infected with the HIV virus.
The 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245 000 orphans after the parents who died of AIDS.
HIV-positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphaned by parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni found the group Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend school of second instance.
In 15 or 20 euros a month can take over the operation.
The guaranteed tuition fees, a school uniform and one hot meal a day in the wet-center.
In the language of the Zulu Imbongi means "a storyteller," or "one who extols."
Fluent bantuštinou fails in this area, no one to talk, sing.
The choir is rehearsing for almost a decade songs in this strange soft words and sometimes it is also brings back where it came from: South Africa.
In the distance 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland Esitjeni village, which is dependent on the strength of the German choir.
Forty percent of infected with
There is some 2,000 people, some still in simple mud and straw huts. A large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents, as they succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni is seen in a small, how well the Swaziland: The highest rate of HIV infikovanosti, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The male circumcision, which reduces the risk of infection by half the population does not accept.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland carries the virus weakened immunity. There is no rarity that die in less than 30 years.
This village discovered the body in a common way for Africa in the spring of 2005. But above all members Imbongi saw many children in the streets, which not only lacked parental care, but everything: Food, clothing, education.
Without a complete school education in a poor country had no chance.
At first, it was still a private commitment of individuals, which in a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
But already a year later was founded a bunch of "Voices for Africa," which has since taking care of orphans of parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
The facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most sexually transmitted disease?
The bacterial SPI belong to syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorea).
Frequent viral SPI are HIV, the human papillomaviruses, herpes glandis or hepatitis.
Crabs and scabies is the parasite SPI.
Who belongs to the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mainly in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five of all cases of syphilis, which were reported in Germany, are transmitted through sexual contacts between the men.
In heterosexual adults are sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently, chlamydiové infection, trichomonády, candidiasis (mold), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is spread among heterosexuálními adults in the relatively few, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections in this group.
Among adolescent with chlamydiové infection are significantly more often than other groups of the population.
According to the European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
In addition, we are human papillomaviruses are often among adolescents.
Evolved as the number of infections?
Not all of the sexually transmitted disease must be reported.
The number of infected syfilidou, according to the Robert Koch Institute in 1697 disease in 2001, more than doubled to 3698 disease in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV since 2007.
The year 2011 was about 700 cases.
That is about one-tenth of less than a year before.
What are the symptoms point to sexual disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulties in urination, discharge, pain in the abdomen and pimples and warts.
Often, however, do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore nezpozorovány.
How is it possible to protect?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, however, do not offer 100 percent protection.
As the originators of sexually transmitted diseases and infections may be partially transferred from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, particularly in the event of frequent rotation of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis is possible to cure most of SPI and prevent the long-term consequences.
Thanks to the patronage, charitable donations and last but not least, honorářům, which earns a chorus singing throughout Germany, gather some money.
"We have to Esitjeni sent about 200 000 euros," says the league Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, confident woman who can impose.
Also takes care of orphaned children found shelter, for example, in one of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as in the language of the Zulu says old women are the backbone of the village.
Some of them have even 14 orphans, give them shelter and care for children in early every day in school uniforms.
Children don't go to a shelter for Khanyisile, a lone woman paid by society as well as two cooks that daily cooking for more than 200 of hungry children.
"Play for Africa" and established a school, built two chicken houses and, together with the American Health Organisation PSI so many people in the village had HIV test.
It is not granted. Even though the disease in the country so obvious, all is silent about it.
The king's 14 wives
"Aids is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has nothing to do with sexuality."
In fact, strange enough in a country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.
Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his expected lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-approved by way of life is also to blame for the fact that the HIV virus has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But even many migrant workers who took the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but no one is being used.
The culture is different - unprotected intercourse. "
At least a little to promote cultural exchange, travels the Imbongi once every two, three years after South Africa together and singing songs full of grief, militancy, confidence in the future and the self-esteem of black, which many in the southern tip of the black continent is known from the days of apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in the language of blacks - such valuation is not only the mood and joy, but also sparked tears in many wild border troops.
The road always leads to Esitjeni, where singers will visit the children, over which they have patronage.
Although this village hardly can be found on maps, in the valley of the River Ezulweni is more than familiar.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is light," says the people there.
And when you return to Heidelberg, which is miles away as the crow flies 8733, dupajícím singers in the rehearsal room at Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light shines here.
Messenger: NASA appeared on Mercury ice
The probe Messenger found evidence that the ice is on the planet Mercury.
The thickness of the ice cap could have up to 20 meters.
The US National Aeronautics and (NASA) demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Even though it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as shown by the three studies, which on Thursday published a magazine "Science."
The probe Messenger found evidence that in the area of the planet, which lies in the shadow, there is ice cap.
It is said to be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 feet thick.
The water seems to come from comets, or perhaps even from the asteroid belt, which came into the Mercury.
But none of the ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, "said the scientists working on the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can be up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The findings, however, we could help to explain how the water and other basic elements of life in other areas of the solar system.
The probe, telescopes and little robots like Phoenix, nepozorovaní Earthlings are involved in exploring the depths of space.
From time to time to send to Earth, a small window into the emptiness.
The film comes from the photographic apparatus, which developed by German scientists from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolve around the sun beyond Neptune, Ceres under the new conceptual definition of the International Astronomical Union in 2006, "the planet."
This section of the infrared ray telescope Spitzerova shows "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points worse identifiable are pink-colored "babies" in the delivery room of stars.
This area, where are the stars - scientists call it neromanticky W5, Spitzer telescope in the constellation't Cassiopeia in 6,500 light-years away.

It is located at a distance of 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to the Earth continent has brought this nebula naming of North America.

One of the biggest and the sharpest pictures of the Hubble: Whirlpool Galaxy
Photos of the spiral galaxies, according to their markings become real works of art.
The picture, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows a few thousand light-years distant nebula Trifid in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name comes from the Latin word "Trifid trifidus" (divided into three parts, trojklanný), as the dark streaks of dust into the glowing heart hospital in three parts.

Photographs from the Hubble Space Telescope shows the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cefea.
The 1400 light-years distant nebula is made up of dust grains, which are 10 times to 100 times smaller than the usual domestic dust.
This image has been compiled from various optical and X-ray telescopes.
A ring of black holes, which is about 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called ARP 273, noted Hubbleův Space Telescope for NASA.
The scientists call this a spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The birthplace of stars still gives a new gains.
Also, the star clouds, associated with Rosette nebula, a new young stars are far removed from 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust, but only the gas.
Scientists believe that it was only shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our eyes into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 Hans Lipperhey. Before Galileo Galilei it a year later, he used to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirror optical telescopes grew - and looks that broker, are still deeper.
It was the largest telescope in the world for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Haleův telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture was an average of five meters.
In the US, Arizona's Large Binocular Telescope.
Provides insights into space by two mirrors, each of which has an average of 8.4 meters.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is enormous. Just a mirror measured at an average of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to-costs.
Still, his average is about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of cheap way of construction: The telescope is secured hákovadlem angle in the high-rise, which limited his mobility.
In the high-rise angle is fixed, the Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas.
It is a high-gain of flux.
This is despite the relatively small diameter mirror mirror dalekohledům is the largest in the world.
Using the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) in the universe, scientists searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This radioteleskop has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help every owner of a computer, which will be available to its computing power.
Look at the post of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
It says the Very Large Telescope - and it does to his name.
The telescope, with a total of four mirrors can shine a light through the mid-infrared spectrum.
The Very Large Telescope is planned for the Chilean Observatory ESO.
Its main mirror is full of 42 feet and is to be composed of nearly 1,000 mirrored elements.
But the images can be counted as soon as possible in 2018.
Two Hawaiian Keckovy telescopes on Mauna Kea in 2007, considered to be the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors, each with an average of 10 meters.
Keckovy telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which in addition to the universe and using the Subaru telescope and IRTTF.
Also on Mauna Kea has created a new giant telescope - with a hundred-foot diameter mirror.
Here you can admire him in the picture.
The most important impressions of the universe, however, provides Hubbleův Space Telescope.
The images of distant worlds gives us from 24 April 1990.
Kepler space telescope searching since March 2009 after extrasolar planets, especially for those that are habitable.
2 February 2011, NASA announced that, from the beginning of the mission was established 1235 candidate planets.
In the picture are documented final preparations before the Kepler space telescope.
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be the first in 2018 fired into space aboard rockets Ariane5.
The primary mirror space infrared telescope has an average of 6.5 feet.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to seek the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
The scientists are based on the fact that the ice at the South Pole Mercury.
For this, however, there are no reliable data, as the Messenger circling the planet far closer to the North Pole.
The radar measurements showed several decades to the ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the probe Messenger, which was launched in 2004 and is the first, which revolves around the Mercury, scientists are now confident.

Ride we can call the Talyš wildly romantic.
The bus rumbles down the road with many curves along the heavily wooded hills, wild rivers and free of farms.
Everything is green and lush, it almost seems that we are in Schwarzwaldu.
But this is the farthest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few miles away.
Here's Talyšů Caucasian ethnic group, to which it is not very well known, in addition to speak a Persian and ázerbájdžánsky and with a very old age.
The final stop is the Lerik.
This town, too monumental architecture of Soviet times, which is in a picturesque mountain landscape somehow.
Tourists from Europe, I don't. The arrival of the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
It is necessary to 323 kilometers (eight hours, because the road is only jednoproudová.
The fabulous wealth, for which the country owes oil in the Caspian Sea, to the country had not yet arrived.
Pilatus Fatullayev (48), however, is convinced that the Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku in May for the price of Eurovision Song Contest - and we will be here next year's festival, the oldest people in the world," says Fatullayev.
Longevity is the director of the museum, about one in the world.
This is documented the lives of nearly eight dozen Talyšů from around the country who are more than a hundred years. Fatullayev shows a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years.
In the age of 136 years had fathered a child.
The star of this museum is, however, a shepherd sheep Şirali Müslümov, who allegedly was 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And, given that the oldest man in the documents was 122 years of age Müslümovův seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this area, and died in 1973," says Fatullayev.
This man was allegedly married three times and had 23 children aged 136 said he had fathered a daughter.
He is therefore Şirali Müslümov at his age a few decades?
The aged people in Central Asia, however, heard the Rembrandt Scholz, gerontolog Max Planck Institute in Rostock.
"A lot of people living in old age, and in some areas of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia is extremely many very old men."
Because of a lack of supporting documents, however, cannot be made no scientific proof of age, especially when missing from the registry office.
Every day a glass of melted butter
But the fact is that the people in the area around Leriku live biblical age very often.
Currently, there are 20 people who are more than 100 years old.
So why are so many people here in the south of the ancient?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains the specific genes Talyšů.
On the contrary, the director of the museum Fatuljeva believes that it is in nutrition.
But that's just the calorie diet Talyšů who love meat, bread and milk products, and many of whom daily drink a cup of melted butter is so healthy, in terms of bromatologického was not credible.
Or is it the old way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiranu, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzajeva.
In the 97 years at this latitude is still relatively young.
Mirzajeva, which says it has 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the whole of the Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground with máselnicí, relentlessly rolling.
Under one roof there are eight people, including one of the sons and daughter Mirzajevy. Both have long been grandparents.
Bobbing around and two small children.
In the kitchen, preparing for guests tea, which is administered in a typical-glasses ", he."
White teeth Mirzajevy consists of a series of hidden under a scarf and long, dark blond braids before us proudly reveals her son.
I've always washing my hair, so I didn't and maintain the color.
"I had never used shampoo," says Mirzajeva.
The monthly pension for life
Eat only what came from her own Court, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I've never once did not buy the food in the supermarket.
He tells me about her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst in the Second World War.
But things improved when the oar took over the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev.
The propaganda is from the old woman.
But the cult, which makes around the figure of his father, who ruled as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows no bounds.
He was in power in 2003, then beat his son Ilham.
Old people in Azerbaijan, at least do not need.
Mirzajeva receives a monthly pension of 230 manatů (approximately the same amount in euro). This is here, from which to good use.
And maybe he's right, the son of a grizzled Mirzajevy: "Old people enjoy high esteem in our culture."
They live in the middle of a large family, they are loved, opečováváni and are happy.
If that is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" in the Constitution is
She returned to Cairo revolution.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo revealed a deep ambivalence in the country.
The sharp debate on the future constitution based on Sharia law.
The Egyptian president has pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And for that we can do that, I'm responsible, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, especially the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular parties.
They all still hopelessly squabbling in the opposition, they are afraid.
The fear of "God's state" on the Nile issued at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursí almost apologetically that temporarily reduce the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his to "save the revolution."
But what he wants 61letý engineer, who has a degree of doctor of American University in southern California, really, in that they have the Egyptians and the world.
The judiciary has to be stripped of power?
234 sections which stohlavé Constituent Assembly dominated by Islamists patnáctihodinovém hastily approved in a marathon, in part to raise concern.
As in previous constitutions, even in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what does "the principle of"?
It was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists this vague wording and associated legal leeway to use for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At least it illuminates the newly added section: In all matters relating to the sharia, you should consult with the University of Al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institutions in the country with a great deal of influence on the whole Sunni Islam.
It may not, but it may mean that klérus will exercise control over the legislation, which would bring the effective withdrawal of justice.
In the draft constitution is a matter of interpretation of
The problem also is that has to be continued civil jurisdiction of military courts.
These courts have served as Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship was in military custody to 11 000 civilians.
In the proposal, it should also stand to protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values."
It is legally worded so loosely that it could use this section of the state institutions even control the content of the film art and literature.
In plain language, it doesn't mean anything other than censorship.
Indeed, no section in writing does not define explicit equality between men and women.
But another section prohibits shaming or to defame the prophet Mohammed and his envoy.
It remains unclear, however, what is insulting and how it will be prosecuted.
Equally dubious is the wording that it is forbidden "insulting people."
In this case, it is already a caricature of President or a joke at the expense of experts law?
A matter of interpretation, like many others in this proposal, which Mursí present for the signing and his words will be "very soon" to present the Egyptians for the popular vote.
"The revolution back."
For several weeks, the opposition is outnumbered by Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in the unusual unity on Friday night in Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to destroy the constitutional document before it begins to pay.
"The revolution is back and we will win," said Hamdín Sabbáhí in presidential elections in third place.
The Nobel laureate and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei said that the draft constitution is "to the dustbin of history."
Through short message service Twitter followers accused Mursího that they want to carry out "a coup against democracy."
"If a referendum, we will go to the palace and toppling him," said a member of the opposition Yasser Said.
"We're still not tired, the blood of our brothers is not punished," the media quoted Egyptian opposition politician Khalid Ali.
Several of the judges announced that they do not want to supervise the referendum, which would become invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution,"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared vzdorodemonstraci, out of caution, however, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile before káhirskou university.
She attended many veiled women and supporters of Salafis, who called: "People are demanding the application of God's law."
Called Mursího: "Clean the country!" And assured: "The Koran is our constitution."
The battle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would trigger a civil war.
It Mursího supporters clearly did not want to take the risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood claimed that the opponents and supporters of the draft constitution loudly and clearly expressed.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box to decide which direction the country has to go.
For some, it is considered to be a majority in favour of the Islamists.
"The word 'human rights' there is not one."
Forced the constitutional dispute, which should, in fact, continue until February and integrate all social forces, ročiluje Hafez Abu Sa du.
Forty-eight human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood, when they were in prison or under Mubarak stood before the court.
Not because they shared their ideology, but because of human rights are indivisible.
That he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now in the new constitution are the words' human rights' not once," he complained in an interview for the "Welt am Sonntag."
Mursího expansion of power to all three components of power in the state of the lawyer forced to resign.
These measures are scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game, and Egypt will lead to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of the president of civil society, in fact it has cancelled," said Sa da.
However, civil society organisations democracy cannot work.
SA da feel abandoned by the international community, which monitors the ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That he could easily backfire.

The Norwegian rakfisk: Most of fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway, is one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe but also in the world.
It might be the secret of the success of the country associated with the local appetite for extremely smelly fish?
Take a couple of overripe cheese.
Put it in the middle of the pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Let it a week.
So you can smell the stench of paralyzing rakfisku, one of the largest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in the tiny town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a beautiful view - and the ever-present odor in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout fermented in the water for up to a year, depending on how much you want to fish stank.
As the dark and getting cold, start with the Norwegians here in Fagernes on the festival dedicated to this, how to say it best nejpodmanivějšímu food.
"You eat it raw and then it shall zapijete glass," says Havard Halvarsen, local professional fireman, but also the so-called "Rakfisk general" who is responsible for the festival.
All around us people eat small cubes of fish with a large quantities of alcohol.
"Some people have rather than the rakfisk aquavit," says Havard.
Beverage can smell of the match.
A few pieces of try.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not that bad - it's like a piece of sushi, who was on a long journey by bus.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different time, when he was in Norway, poverty, and because there was no fridge, fish in the fall as they arced away into airtight barrels of water and salt.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, pulled and eat - no doubt senses dulled the alcohol.
Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and look for work, while the majority have emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of immigrants are attracting a large amount of work, high earnings and an extensive system of care.
The people of Sweden, an old rival, which not long ago was much richer than Norway, flowing into the country to work.
The rakfisk is regarded as something important, indispensable, even though a smelly part of the past.
Are among the more expensive meals on the market.
Even if everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich you come to 9 pounds (14 dollars) apiece.
Norway is the world's reports often lack - and it seems that most people like it that way.
The name of Anders Breivik, right-wing racist extremists, who last year shot 77 men, women and children, people here still refer to with distaste.
Instead, the shooting is called "event on July 22."
The Norwegians may find it hard to believe that in their peaceful country was one of them capable of such brutality and murder.
The current wealth of Norway is the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries from the beginning of the 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," he says in the plates with uleželým rakfiskem our waitress Anna, who, with his long blond hair and startling blue eyes is a prototype of the Nordic welfare.
We are, as you say, thoughtful people.
Her English, as well as English of most of the people here, it is absolutely fine.
Nepředvádíme, we don't like the pomp.
Norway deals with its oil wealth very carefully - except for a small percentage of the industry's most of the money invested in a special fund for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial meltdown threw money, which should not, the Norwegians had on its purse strings tight.
"As long as we can in the winter skiing and hiking in the summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"The rakfisk and eat," he adds with the carefree laugh.
Standing in the snow in line for something to eat - rakfisku I've had enough.
Such an elk burger is certainly something else, and it's a juicy.
But the evening's smelly fish here again.
The hotel where I live, is one of many places where the rakfisk for dinner, where guests choose the best, or rather for the sense of smell the most fish.
They have a link to the live television coverage of the moderator with a bow tie, surrounded by a plate with rakfiskem.
It's like a singing Eurovision.
"What do you score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergene?"
"This is our scoring, Håvard."
With the applause and laughter.
The man fell from a chair, perhaps overwhelmed aquavitem.
Or maybe the fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a start
As the incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, staring Will Grant from the BBC to the challenges facing, and the mixed expectations of their fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is currently a particularly bad.
In the city, which is blocked, even in the best of times, were erected steel barriers closing several key routes into the capital, causing chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, did not prevent dojíždějícím to get to work, but to prevent the protesters in access to Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto received the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.
Facing a daunting task.
Mexico during the term of outgoing Felipe Calderon led well economically, however, the country is in the grip of the drug war, which has taken an estimated 60,000 lives in the past six years.
"My government has a strong commitment to the Mexican people in the reduction of violence," the president said Pena Nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy, which will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before he shook hands with the US president, president of Pena Nieta political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
There are different views on the new leader in his old homeland, a vast and populous state surrounding the capital.
A man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo to remember him in good.
He attributed to the development of tourism in the resort and building infrastructure.
Now you can go to the city after one of the new highways, which let Pena Nieto. These highways are a vast improvement from leaky and rugged roads that have been previously.
Plates with his name also hangs on the wall of the modern sports centre and imposing an interactive museum with the issue of climate change.
"We expect that will bring real and lasting change," says a friend and political ally of Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the party of President Pena Nieta, institutionalised Revolution Party (PRI).
In particular, we hope in an interesting and real change in the field of security and the economy, which our country so desperately needs.
After continuous 81 years in power, the party, the PRI ousted Vicente Fox.
Member of the Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos from within the party for Enrique Pena Nieta many expected.
And the opposition refuses to comment characterizing the new president as a man without a significant content.
It's a very straightforward man, very biased with excellent vision of the country.
It's a great statesman and is a man who knows how to listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression that has many of his former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotlu, also known as Ciudad she cannot be contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo more obvious.
Tucked under the traffic overpasses in many ways resembles the suburbs of the capital city of Mexico.
And the problems in the Autonomous Community, are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was called in to help in managing drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, particularly the violence against women.
Only in the last two years were in wild places beside a huge waste dumps littered the bodies of dozens of murdered women.
At a time when Pena Nieto was governor, was killed in the State of Mexico, more than 1,000 women, which is much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In the best case, critics Pena Nieta say that during his term in office failed to adequately addressing the problem of the murders of women.
And, in the worst case, accusing his leadership of closing one's eyes.
In the concrete house typical of a run-down neighborhood, Buendia Irinea shows me photographs of their deceased daughter Mariana Islands Luna and crying.
According to the official version of the Marian committed suicide in 2010.
Her family, however, believe that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, so it seemed as if her body had been washed," says Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of blows and had already begun rigor mortis.
As her mother tells the story, Marian looking down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, which is a single word: "Justice."
However, this is, as he says family, exactly what they have been denied.
State authorities they treat me as if I was the old gossip, a troublemaker and kňouralka.
They want you to just accept what they say, and silent.
"But it cannot be right that there have been so many errors and omissions," he says.
Sash, president of Pena Nieto on Saturday, is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of families were affected by violent crime in Mexico, the new president promised during his tenure in office will be his priority.
"I hope that the president will be the same as the governor," he says in the Valle del Bravo member of the PRI Olvera.
But that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad she fears the most.
Bradley Manning complained of ill-treatment, says the military prosecutor
The military prosecutor is trying to rebut claims Bradley Manning on the rough treatment in custody.
The hearing focused on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to have the case dismissed on the basis of gross treatment with Manningem in prison.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of secret material in U.S. history, missed many opportunities to complain about the rough treatment, which allegedly suffered in military custody.
The military prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein on cross-examination, Private Manning in the preliminary hearing at Ft. Maede in Maryland argued that the records weekly visits that Manning had with the officers of the unit during the nine months of detention at Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints of ill treatment.
Cross-examination, which occurred during a hearing on the motion to reject the case against manning because of rough treatment at the time of the links, which is in itself sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified to the fact that in custody thought about suicide.
Army intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never provided no evidence that Manning was the source of its information.
At Friday's hearing, through the military prosecutor Fein together with Manningem forms that officers fill out after meeting with Manningem in detention at Quantico, where he was from July 2010 to April 2011, held in the high security.
The officers manning asking the questions and recording his answers.
When Fein said Friday on these forms, Manning said, that the treatment by their guards as "excellent" and the overall treatment at the facility as "very professional."
The forms do not show any complaints of ill-treatment, even if the officers Manning directly asked how it is handled, Fein said.
Manning said that concerns about the various problems to express orally and that officers who visited him, talking to him about these concerns and indicated that they will deal with these problems, however, did not.
"Wrote" no problems "(after discussed concerns), and it doesn't necessarily mean that I have to mention it," Manning said.
Judge Col. Denise Lind, Manning also asked why he complained about the treatment of his party in January 2011, when meeting with the commission examining the suicidal thoughts, which a few months earlier expressed in the form.
Manning said that, in the course of this meeting was his intention to reduce the "prevention of injury."
The army said that for him the restrictive regime (one degree under the supervision of suicide) used for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the guards in custody knew that I'm fine and that I wanted to abolish the system of injury prevention... so I can enjoy the high quality of life, as I saw it," said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before he was transported to a detention center at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait, and once there because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what it is, and what is happening in the outside world, it was very depressing.
"My world had only on the base Arifdžán, the cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in that cage.
Manning said that after arriving at Quantico spent most of his days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said that he was allowed only one mattresses, blankets, slippers, some clothes and sunglasses.
He said that he tried to walk, because the sleeping or lying in the course of the day it was against the rules.
Manning said that always slept with light from the outside of the cell in the eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned in the night, on the other hand, woke him and he had to turn back.
Manning's lawyer lodged a formal complaint to the treatment of Pvt. Manningem in January 2011.
Manning was in April 2011, moves to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked the accusation, which raised in Thursday's testimony, that after he was forced to sleep one night in his cell at Quantico naked, was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other inmates in the morning.
Manning said that at the time he was not allowed to hide his blanket.
In Friday's questioning by Judge Manning said that one of his bodyguards decided that the blanket could hide, postponed, but admitted that his orders for its postponement.
On Thursday, Manning said that last night was forced to sleep naked, because the officer tried to show that he is not dangerous.
Manning said that the officer said that he could use the belt of his underwear or his slippers to hurt, but he didn't.
Manning said that the night was removed from his cell in his underwear, his slippers and glasses.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account of his experiences during his detention and that in the event of his conviction before a military court, which is expected to start at the beginning of next year, will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense has said that he plans to Manning admits guilt in the lower crime and that he would fight against other accusations, because they are too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will argue the detention conditions as legitimate.
The Pentagon said the declaration that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions relating to all of those arrested held in custody, with a maximum security.
Among the charges against manning is aiding the enemy against the law of the publication of the intelligence documents on the Internet, the transfer of information relating to national security and theft of public property or records.
If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
My Mexican-American identity crisis of
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them of the hard times, he says.
Navarrette says that Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On the last trip to the capital of Mexico, I was hardly his way through the crowd, and I came into the room for the agenda of immigrants, where I ran into a problem.
The arrow pointing to one of the two fronts: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Strangers").
I stood there for a few seconds, and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in central California, and all my life I was called "Mexican."
It's ethnic stands, the same as when my friends in Boston as "the Irish," and my friends in New York call themselves as "the Italians."
Later, I ended up in the "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, it was not necessary to use abbreviations.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in that language.
However, I don't have the vocabulary of native speakers and I can't get rid of an American accent.
So I pulled out his American passport and stood in line for "Extranjeros."
I was thinking about the moment this week, Mexican President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto, visited President Obama in the White House.
On the agenda were the issues that are, as the leaders of the two countries will meet: Immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why is the likelihood that the Mexicans will remain in Mexico, as they travel to the United States.
He wants to join with the United States and Canada, and to create a North American trading bloc similar to the European Union.
And Pena Nieto has promised that it will continue in Mexico's war against drug cartels, although he did not provide any details.
For Mexico's relationship with the United States complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader, under the threat of weapons over half of Mexico's territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans, who thinks in centuries, not minutes, the comments are ubiquitous.
So a minute after the United States says something a little critical of Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and among the elite of complaints about how the Americans interfere in the sovereignty of its neighbor.
And the children Montezumy starts on the warpath.
And yet it is the real challenge for Mexico to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about the hostile feelings?
There is a lot.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, the people of the country offers possibilities, and others who did not.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree was the person, maybe a parent or grandparent, which was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the north.
And more often than would seem to fit the profile of the person - dark skin, poor education, come from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not against Mexico.
And even though we are living the American dream, we go to good schools, and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not Mexico's.
Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
Is to the United States.
And we are aware that many of the elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class doesn't like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and look at us as an inferior race, which is not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico never strong enough.
Our existence is, in their view, only a failure.
If our families in Mexico have failed, it would never left him.
And we are now found no imprisoned for silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but he still lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally in childhood had come to the United States, reminds me that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans there is tension, because more Mexicans understand who they are, and Mexican-Americans resent it.
Even though he is a citizen of the United States, sees itself as part of the two countries.
And, at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know, feel as part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican group Los tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don't have roots in one.
In Mexico, for us is viewed as the Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And to complicate relations, they want some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I learned during his trip, combined with the Diaspora.
They want to Mexican-Americans worked for Mexico as a "makeshift ambassadors" and represented the Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American citizens, how wonderful it is to visit the country, and pressure on political leaders to shore up relations with Mexico.
Well.
It is going to happen.
Too many of the hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us, it is not certain that this is a great country.
I have a feeling that it is up to you, amigos.
It is fair.
If at least some of the Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States how to deal with Mexico in front of one and a half century ago, must accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans still feel indignation for the manner in which it was dealt with their family members in substantially more in the past.
Hmmm..
We may have more "Mexicans" than I thought.
The old battles, a new Middle East
Cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could still be uncertain the basis for peace.
Can ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed suggests that any such activity is in vain.
Among the usual unnecessary speculation about who started it, has been amended many buildings in ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis and the first time rockets from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and in the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even when it seems that the Israelis and the Palestinians are stuck in their ancient conflict, all around the Middle East.
The Arab Spring has changed the old calculus and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are trapped in the ensuing chaos in the region.
Maybe it means that their fight will be even bloodier than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that it may suspend their deadly stalemate.
The war, which is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, it seems that at present there is not much reason for optimism.
Even if a cease-fire signed last November 21, the fight this week to strengthen the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that rules in Gaza since 2007, will argue that forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several leaders of Hamas and the closure of Gaza's 1.7 million people in one of the poorest global and most populous corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by his digging rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian factions.
In addition, the leaders of Hamas may very well decide that time is on their side.
The Islamists throughout the Arab world have more influence, so that Hamas won a powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, revived regional power, which was once Israel's closest Muslim ally, have been added to the side of Hamas. As well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Cheering people from Hamas, saying that the Islamic crescent moon circles around Israel, to the north of Lebanon, where there is a party / militia Hezbollah through Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly drawn to islamizmu can unseat Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where the king's allies of Hamas.
And, above all, on Israel's southern flank changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, under the leadership of President Mohammad Mursího in Egypt, by far the most populous and the Arab countries, the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, not on Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood's cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more susceptible to public opinion.
Hamas in the future diplomacy may appear as a player, who cannot be excluded either Israel or America.
Israeli hardliners, however, come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was put back into the box.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has its price, and many of the Hamas rockets were destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terms, America is as hard as always. Many European countries also blaming Hamas from the start of the latest round of violence.
And - Israel to prosper, in particular, under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets from Gaza since 2004 killed around 30 Israelis, was relatively quiet in Israel from suicide bombers, in part because of the wall, which interferes with the West Bank, the main part of what one might be a Palestinian state, and protects the Jewish settlements, which are still growing, despite its illegality in front of international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party at the start of the campaign for the elections held on 22 January teamed up with even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why spoil the treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If you really ruled in the West Bank, neodpalovali rockets, as they did their compatriots in Gaza?
It would be better if we stay behind that wall and hit them when it heads.
Maybe hardliners will win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.
Even though the Islamists, who gained power in Egypt and other countries, not Israel, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israeli defense spending is higher than the cost of all of his four Arab neighbors together.
The launch of a new war with the local superpower hardly helps the new Arab governments to heal its economy.
The fact that President Mursí worked with President Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire, is a good sign, and it may be the start of something new.
The Israelis also should look at the situation in the long term.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, it creates a denial of the rights of Palestinians to self-determination, a barrel of gunpowder, which must one day explode in areas occupied by Israel, as well as the bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.
Currently the repression of the democracy in the Jewish state and the demographics of this situation even worse, as the Arab population is growing.
The bloody attacks against Gaza held every few years in order to push Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what they say reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world, and this newspaper: Two states, Israel referred to the territory because of security.
In the short term, there is little hope that the cease-fire will provide the pressures from the outside at least a little more influence on this matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar must do more to stop the supply of arms to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs from outside must also push for consensus between Hamas and Fatah.
It would be for the creation of a Palestinian state was more than an immediate offer virtual sovereignty to the United Nations.
President Obama also has its share of on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term he ignored the show of his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, seems to be just as reluctant in its entry into the process.
It is woefully short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia entered into force the laws on the ugly cigarette packaging
Green on the backs of the boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, are depicted warning for smokers and the sick part of the body.
The Australian laws on the packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, and the logo and colors brands replaced the general olive green boxes of ugly pictures of diseased parts of the body, and a display of children and newborns onemocnělých smoking as a result of their parents.
In addition to the various health warnings and images are required from Saturday, the only difference between the boxes brand names, which are printed in the small print.
This is a strict regime in the world on the packaging of tobacco.
The Australian federal government argues that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking, a habit of his attraction.
He relies on studies that show that when people start smoking at the age of 26 years, there is a 99 percent chance that they never quit.
"Even in very young children, you can see that he understood the message that the tobacco companies are trying to sell his product," says Tanya Plibersek Federal Minister for Health and cites studies that have shown, for example, that children are combining the crown in the log with the idea to be a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering the introduction of similar steps.
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
The tobacco companies argued that this law will increase trading on the black market, which will lead to cheaper and more abundant.
"This legislation will be a serious unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia would bring more of these products, which will be sold on the streets of Australia.
Other states that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family businesses, said that the demand on cigarette packages of silicon used to cover the unsavoury boxes, two months ago, when the company British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost its appeal for the laws to the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha said that the company has sold almost 6 000 Zico wholesale dealers and expects the new supplies.
It is a good deal for us.
As a possible problem experts cite the popularity of social media in that demographic groups to which the plan aims.
After a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsorship of sports events and demanding that the majority of dealers hiding cigarettes from direct gaze, the tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising by local companies and Internet sites, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry, and you have only this little room for the promotion of your products, it is for you online space insurmountable place in which you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.
Mrs. Freeman noted an increase in the brands on social networks, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by the "average John."
We have to ask, it's just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and took the job and created this video, or is involved in the marketing company?
, British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry focused on how to deal with the new regulations on marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - the country within the framework of the World Trade Organisation argue that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia significantly.
The ruling PPW is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the government has held talks with other governments that are considering similar laws relating to the packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce compulsory in 2001 warning pictures.
Now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia is resisting.
The pictures of me have no influence.
Just ignore it.
"You pull out a cigarette and put the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photograph of the tumor in his mouth.
Frankly, there is only one reason to quit smoking, and this is my little girl.
James Yu, who owns trafiku King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, says that thanks to a single packs, the harder it is for him to hit the shelves.
"Unloading it took me one hour, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.
"The government simply was completely banned, then we said, OK, this is the end, closing up shop '," he said, spreading his hands.
In a world of constant connection is not so bad to be bored
Last Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly had spent five hours at the airport, when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.
So we had a lot of time to think about the boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Wait for half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distractions of books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention the duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development increasingly coming up with praise nudění.
They say that, for us, our children (and) is good sometimes bored.
It forces the brain to go into interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And given that most of us today is constantly connected to a screen, we don't have a chance to enjoy the boredom.
We should therefore support the boredom?
Yes. "
And not.
But I will come back.
Firstly, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon, which occurred with the arrival of more free time.
But, as he says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, who is the author of Boredom: A Lively History (History of boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, has a long history of boredom," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found the Latin inscription on the boredom, dating from the first century AD.
And then there is also the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, "said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After watching the research literature and demonstration of ideas to an audience of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues define boredom as experience, "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't able to."
Boredom is different from the apathy that person is not involved in anything, but I would like to be.
He says that there is no need to do something for apathy.
He says that "the disruption of the process is at the heart of boredom, joined in a bad mood and a sense of time probe cruised slowly."
Boredom is a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship, when people tend to see the problem as the environment, or the world, while people who are depressed, sees the problem within ourselves.
Sometimes we think the bored, when we only have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out in an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to the tape, on which he read an article in the magazine.
Some groups have heard loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so low that he barely noticed, while a third group didn't hear it at all.
Those who heard a television program, reported more boredom than the other two groups - had trouble with concentration, but were not sure why, and attributed the problem of boredom.
When you're trying to concentrate on a difficult or exciting task, can lead to distortion of boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you're doing something boring, "such as the search for the bad parts of the factory line, distracting music can help with that, you get bored."
In fact, he said, we now know that twisting and drawing, which is often regarded as a sign of boredom, may actually help to fight boredom and keep people physically more attentive.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to stir, to learn more and more information than those who are forced to sit in peace," said Professor Fenske.
We all are sometimes boredom experienced - my flight delays, the speaker, particularly lengthy film.
But some individuals have a greater chance of bored than others.
To help with the measurement of boredom in the 1980s, scientists have developed a "Living for susceptibility to nudění" (Boredom Proneness Scale).
The scale covers issues such as: "Many of the things that I have to do, and it's monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do it all."
Using these scales, researchers found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, particularly with regard to the need to have more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers, however, are generally indifferent.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, has conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times a day contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents.
He found that 32 percent of adolescents have indicated that they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent reported that they were bored when they were in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents reported that they were bored.
Professor Larson said that he did not know whether the percentage of boredom was now, 21 years later, more or less.
He said, however, that he knows that "adolescence is the time for boredom," which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given a lot of control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Boring is good for you?".
As the research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form can lead people to undergo a physical risks, playing games or abused addictive substances as a way to relieve it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discuss the link between boredom and creativity, "said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the way the brain to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain is not always the best thing you should do.
If you're bored and use the energy to play the guitar and cooking, you will be happy to do that.
However, if you watch television, do you happy just for a moment, not in the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give him the iPad, you won't be bored, but learn how to entertain themselves or self-drive, said Professor Fenske.
And "this separate proceedings are transmitted from one situation to another," he said.
Your child learn only how to entertain themselves, but will gain greater control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate the boredom.
But we should not be too critical to her.
Our aim should rather be to feel comfortable when we are out of range of the business and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We are accusing her of the need to be bored, but boredom is painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people are looking for, in fact, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy free time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly přestimulovaní," he said, "it is difficult to find ways to keep the noise down."
In Colorado, there is no handbook on the new law on marijuana
Nineteen Anthony Orozco, a student at a vocational school and football player from the southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be in its state legal - for possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe used for smoking.
Mr. Orozco said that a September day went with a few friends in Lamaru, on the plains near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr Orozco was issued a summons for possession of drugs and equipment for drug use - petty crimes for which the penalty for each $100 - and set the date of the court.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But it is a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks after Colorado vote on legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use of hundreds of smaller drug cases, the answer depends on-the-spot rather than on the law.
Hundreds of cases of offences for possession of marijuana was already here and in Washington state, which has approved similar measures.
The police department to stop blaming adults aged 21 years of age and older for possession of a small amount of which will be legally allowed after the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But the more conservative districts in Colorado have said that they will continue with the existing cases involving marijuana, and still blame people for possession.
At the same time, several cities from the Denver suburbs toward the western hills votes on the prevention of the opening of the new, state-licensed marijuana shops in their communities.
"This thing is evolving so quickly that I don't know what will happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.
Heads of the gossip and regulators in Washington State.
And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licences for cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all by the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether for good or bad, it is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use, and now and recreation.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Council for licensing the sale of alcohol in the state of Washington.
But, as Mr. Smith admitted no place or the system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent, according to which we can manage," he said.
The Washington law, the so-called I-502, shall take effect on December 6, which also left the annual vacuum, during which there will be no more state licensing system, but legal possession of it.
And there are messy mechanical issues that must be resolved during this period, for example, how to balance the state's directive on the "appropriate approach" to the licensed marijuana with its ban on trade with hemp to 330 feet from schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's centres.
"There will be more difficult to place the licensed trade with hemp than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan areas of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for legal hemp, recently-based research group.
21 November sent police chief Oates from the city of Aurora his officers e-mail in which they announced that the city will no longer prosecute offenses for possession of a small quantity of marijuana for each person aged 21 years and that the police "with immediate effect" to stop blaming people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police will enforce the laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that it will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In the Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck stricter.
After the vote, said that his office will continue to prosecute cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way to push for users to seek treatment.
Is currently facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, even though many of them are facing other charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offense, which was crimes at the time they occurred," Mr. Buck said in his statement.
Reaction has been complicated, even in places like rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the joint initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, has already grown blame for possession of small quantities.
The District Attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided to reject all ongoing cases of possession.
"I don't think I'm losing my time continuing in law enforcement, until the change," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing the recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And contradictory reactions across the state revealed with regard to this great state green experiment deep ambivalence among local officials.
It is for the district prosecutors' cultural barrier, "said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents accused of possession of marijuana, a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of marijuana Laws.
"They spent so much of his life prosecution of people that still cannot accept the fact that this is legal," he said.
As the first states to a small amount of marijuana, they like to alcohol, Colorado and Washington on the way to become a national test cases for the legalization of drugs.
Advocates and state authorities are planning a new frontier for legalised the sale and also anxiously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which is still in the plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes.
Advocates of legalization of marijuana, hoping that the Ministry of Justice complies.
Despite the arrest of several vendors of marijuana for medical purposes, and the patients who used to attract attention, leaving most of the federal government deals with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and the other 16 states in operation.
While protidrogoví agents may not be out the door to catch a small bag of the drug, it is likely that oppose allowing the state-regulated business with recreational marijuana permitted by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser in the administration of President Obama's drug policy.
Several Colorado cities waiting for the federal authorities.
Even before election day, some local governments have approved a moratorium on any new business with marijuana, even though it will take about a year before he can open any trade.
Last week, the town of Montrose on the western part of the state has proposed a six-month ban, and it is likely that next week will enter into force.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where someone we license and then we will have a federal matter," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against the amendment.
We are looking at what they voted for the municipality, contrary to what the state voted.
There is a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave from Oxford, because I'm a conservative."
Their views are not only attacked by today's college students.
I don't remember that I ever dreamed of studying at Oxford University.
As my father and my elder brother had studied at the university, which I think is the world's leading knowledge-based, modern ovíněné Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And while I am at the end of the 1980s, within two weeks after the onset of the Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed her bags and dashed into the first scandal of his life.
My father broke down and wept.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I gave up because I had objected to the love of students in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson playfully said that I left because I was forced to drink from the battered cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away, because I was subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of his somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of the alleged enlightenment that was as a bigot, so barbaric: My father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, a high-ranking adviser to Margaret Thatcher and a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You can ask why this up until now.
Just because of the latest reports suggest that a new generation of students to the right of center is suffering similar persecution.
Institutionalised and growing hatred against conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week, a group of these students demanding the same protection of equal rights to gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Association of younger (JCR) at Corpus Christi College, says that because of their political views are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and they made clear that they were not welcome."
The committee called for a position in the university for equal opportunity, to ensure that their views are free to communicate.
Their situation, or the recent documentary for BBC Two called Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (Stories of the country: Young, intelligent and right-wing) on the student politics, which conservatives described as odd and neo-Nazis.
The program was introduced to graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA Oxford University Conservative Association), who drove a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and silver head.
Conservative students at other universities say that he is with them because of the introduction of higher tuition fees treated as "a scapegoat."
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of Nottingham University Conservative Association (Conservative Association Nottinghamské University), he told a Sunday newspaper that "left-wing influence in universities is growing.
People think that we're a Bullingdon Club, without meeting with us at all. "
Said a student of history at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that the climate is "bad," while 19-year-old elected president of OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that in the JCR members access to the people to the right of center has worsened.
"This represents a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as for the welfare of the members," he says.
During his first few weeks at Oxford, I was a member of a minority.
I came in September 1986, 18letá and cripplingly shy.
Hatred against the Conservative Party was nejhorečnatější.
A year earlier the university voted to refuse to grant an honorary degree of the former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in funding for higher education.
From the atmosphere, the Stalinists they fear.
During the first few days in the opening week of the new students meet among themselves and with professors, I got a taste of wormwood, who had to come.
I found that not only professors tacitly approved needling conservative pupils, but with a taste even participating.
In the paneled classroom was the policy of the strike, privatisation and government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa.
My first lecture on the translation of the French text from the 18th century into English and what followed, I wasn't ready.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "the first paragraph, please."
It was hard enough.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like dessert dough, was a bilious.
"Thatcherovci refuse to learn French, or are just stupid?" He asked.
The other students snickered.
The tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you do in your spare time took some basic lessons in French, that is, if you're not too busy social issues," said Professor Pitt.
Heartbroken, I returned to her room.
At the dinner in school, I sat alone, when I felt a tap on the shoulder.
It was a sophomore named James, who identified himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said gently.
Unfortunately, it is.
Anyone who is suspected of conservatism, is the target.
For me, it is bad enough, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be even worse for you.
Most of the conservative freshmen pretending that they are labouristi.
Later in the local pub, I tried to pretend to be cowardly.
I insisted that I do not agree with everything that Thatcher said.
This trick has proved unsuccessful.
A first-year student of philosophy, politics and economics, which (how ironic) went to Eton, he said: "You are the daughter of fascist pig."
You are infected.
The other students notovali with him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How the Conservatives love?" One asked.
Hitting each other, right?
I felt so as to how they feel homosexuals from the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Sometimes I could lead a normal life in Oxford?
I was forced to meet with like-minded people just after dark?
I would have to change in labouristu and suppress their natural tendencies?
Three years in front of me to develop a purgatory ignore and isolation.
He was the only openly conservative Professor Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who was in my school.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for the fact that he is an adviser to Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy, and one of those who write speeches.
Almost wasn't there.
He hated the place for his parochialism and pettiness and for his shift to the Marxist-deterministickému view of history.
In 1997, he joined the place of a professor at the University of Bilkentské in Turkish Ankara.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started to commute from Oxford to her parents' house in London, seeking refuge in their non-partisan metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father that Oxford I hate and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, were adopted by all political views.
"But it's the best place in the world," he exclaimed.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreamlike mood.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect ways.
His moist eyes became troubled.
Try it again.
I'm sure that it is just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by the frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
In the course of the next week, when the next history professor in utter seriousness said that "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Even though I was inside flushed with shame, I admitted that my parents "brainwashed" and I called them "old fogies."
Was only short-term relief.
The nail in the coffin of my career, my father hammered.
At the time, he wrote two columns each week in the Murdochs "newspaper.
My door was locked.
I was inside, and after five minutes you my pursuers.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me usmrkaným wimp.
But no 18letá girl or boy in education should not be subject to this kind of intimidation and rancor.
Even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, which not only was 14 of the conservative prime ministers, but also to date, hiding behind the undeserved reputation with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino has elegance, rather than glory."
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of fashion design," which was launched this week in London, told ABC with Naty Abascalovou, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemiszovou and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the residence of Isabel off his back I. English, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition Valentina Garavaniho.
The designer confirmed it at the start of the celebratory retrospective "Valentino: Master of fashion design," which represents more than 130 top fashion models created by his studio for the last 50 years.
"I love this place," he says with his unmistakable, an Italian accent.
This exhibition is the end of the story, which is "il Signore" Garavani only protagonist, but without his cherished clients could not be written.
Valentino has always felt charmed a rare and distant world aristocracy.
The first room of the exhibition, which runs until March 3, with a private correspondence and photographs with the signatures of the nobles, from Princess Salimy Aga Khan across the Greek Princess Marie-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdona.
Valentino exposes these personal memories as trophies of their social recovery: The simple tailor from the town of Voghera in the north of Italy on the international "Bohemian royalty."
Like the royal family, there is nothing wrong.
"They at least netípnou smoke cigarettes into a fine carpets, as do some wonderful celebrity pop-music," says Fiona Baroness Thyssen-Bornemiszová.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps, and we were good friends.
Valentino is impressive host and guests enjoy abundant and with grace.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his chalet in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife "Heiniho" Thyssena and close friend of the beauties like Marella Agnelliová or Eugenie Niarchosová.
"Valentino has always rather than the elegance of glory.
And even so, is a star. "
Valeria Mazzová Valentine's
For someone who was the designer forgets or the Argentine model Valeria Mazzová.
"It's been many years since we even after a parade in the Piazza di Spagna in Rome went to him for dinner.
There were twenty of us and among us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, decor, food, music, in all, and he felt his spirit.
Everyone was thanks to him to feel important and loved ones, "says top model, which started working with him during the Paris fashion week summit in 1995.
"Never goes out of style, because his proposals are works of art," he concludes.
The nobility of
Gravaniho life is a tale of obsession, but really opětovaných ones.
He loves people with good manners and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries Somerset House had been converted to a hundred feet long passage, which offers an exchange of roles: The visitor will become a model and marching passages to watch the "audience" dreams that he's wearing Valentin's masterpieces such as clothes, which chose Jackie Kennedy at his wedding to Aristotle Onassisem, costume, who wore Monica Vittiová in "Night," or a coat of wool and fur, which belonged to the Empress Farah Dibaové.
In the audience mannequins September names like Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria from Thurn and Taxisu, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario Bulgarian or Sophie of Austria.
Naty Abascalová and designer in 2006,
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino's first love, "not to forget him."
"I remember it perfectly.
It was the pants, shirt, vest and jacket, "Gillette" from the autumn-winter collection from the years 1971-1972.
It was a gift that he did for me, "says Naty Abascalová, one of návrhářových muses.
"I give him in front of the other priority for his femininity and a great love for women, because it underscores our beauty," added the former Duchess of Ferii.
"I love the colors, which uses a lot of rozjasňují and give the" spark "face.
The proportions are perfect. "
Neither the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d '5 cannot forget how he first put on Valentine's Day.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she wanted to be a kid and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes.
Finally, in the late 1990s.
"My first dress from Valentine I bought for the occasion celebrations in the castle of his cousin, Prince Edouarda de Ligne.
It was the red dress with a skirt with flounces, billowy strapless bodice and the top.
It was a dream that became a reality, "says the widow Rodriguovi d '5.
"Valentino is lax in fashion, his passion is timeless," says the Italian aristocrat whose life is between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d '5 návrhářovy has imposed a formal dress "very carefully... because the clothes are not only clothes, it is also a set of memories, which are in themselves."
"The King" fashion
The centerpiece of the exhibition at Somerset House, a wedding dress, Marie-Chantal Miller from her marriage to Paul Greek in 1995.
The creation of such a thing with panels ivory-colored silk dress with pearls, 12 different types of lace and a long four and a half feet needed four months of work and 25 "girls" (as he calls the designer of her seamstress).
According to journalist Suzy Menkesové, the highest authority of the specialised press, represent these clothes landmark summit fashion end of the 20th century, "the return of the clients of high society."
Valentino dazzled during the years of the elitist "savoir-être" is now the best example.
Garavani as the Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated order of the Legion of Honour accumulate so many honors as any of his clients.
"I have always attracted the attention of his vybranost, quiet, neat and perfect appearance," the princess acknowledges d '5.
"The last time I saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum d'Orsay.
He was at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
It was the perfect time to leave no trace. "
When it says the princess.
The toughest job in the world: The sulphur Kawah Ijen volcano in the area
In four of the euro gamble medium in the area of the Indonesian volcano with his life and health, when 70 kilos of sulphur swoop down the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom it is their work, and there are those who work in hell.
This is the case with Anta Wijayi, one of 400 miners who make their living from Kawah Ijen volcano conquering the sulphur in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, every day fárat to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gases escaping from the interior of the Earth and in contact with air passes into a solid state.
After all the large blocks of sulphur, which together weigh up to 70 pounds, takes them on the shoulders of the two bamboo baskets stone paths.
At the top of the volcano, which rises 2 386 yards, it's just 250 meters, but exhausted bearers for over 40 minutes before they get tortoise pace up because they maintain balance and thoroughly reflected his steps to neuklouzli and nezřítili into the abyss.
They know that any misstep could cost him his life, as happened one French turistce, which collapsed years ago from Kawah Ijen rocks.
The miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for each kilo of sulphur, which earns
When they are at the top, making her way around the tourists who took them, as if they were a monkey in the circus, and tired is hard to the basket to weight, which placed the mining company, at an altitude of 1850 metres.
This is a firm PT Candi Ngrimbi, which benefit from a volcano in 1960 and never paid their workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.
Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical industry, as this product has its place in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar.
"As it is commonly worn by 70 pounds, earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip," explains Anto us, which usually carried out three trips a day.
One way it takes him three hours and at the end of it, but he can then earn 138, 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Although it seems to be a negligible amount for such inhuman effort, it is three times what he earned in the field.
"The daily wage of miners here is very high. For example, for the collection of coffee to pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and salary in a fortnight's two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his salary 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day, and the work was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for good reason, which is in Indonesia as convincing as sulphur: "I got married with a young girl from Bali, a Hindu, and I took her to Java, converted to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing, coughing and irritated eyes are toxic gases
In his 27 years of Anto three times daily risking his life in Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulphur, it has already begun to take their toll, even though her face is protected by a special mask and goggles.
He has asthma, breathing, coughing and irritated eyes are toxic gases escaping from the volcano.
This is the price that must pay for it to achieve his dream.
"I will work for two more years, because I want to open a trade or to study Spanish or French," promises more than passable English.
This charming and intelligent young man in fate could be a tourist guide, the waiter or the reception in the hotel, and instead of doing the work of the media.
Shares the dirty wooden shack with other carriers, and every day she gets up at two o'clock in the morning, because sulfur at night and continues to build up its distinctive yellow color changes in blue and September in the dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness fárá Anto into the crater and illuminates the way a small lamp, which is mounted on his helmet and bought it for their money.
About 400 media are on the shoulders of the sulfur from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high incomes, sulphur mining nezmechanizovala because of cost savings, or provide porters working on their own and with such vigor, no equipment.
In fact, do not receive a share of 30 000 rupees (2.5 euros) from a surcharge on photography, which, along with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) to collect the natural park from tourists who come in to photograph a volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for livestock, and not for the people," says Madrusin, a 42-year old porter who works in Kawah Ijen for three decades, ever since he left the school.
 He can lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that it will work, "as long as you can," because he needs the money for the education of his three sons aged between 18 and 10 years ago.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano was my whole life
Although the sulphur burn the throat and stings the eyes, when the wind suddenly turn and traps the miners in the thick fumes from the volcano, the miners are saying that none of them complaining that suffers from serious diseases... but it is clear from their frequent respiratory problems into arthritis pain in his knees and shoulder wounds caused by the weight of the baskets.
Unainik who balances his basket on his back, in his 53 years may pick up only 50 pounds.
Every day, he and his colleagues in the volcano vydolují 15 tons of sulphur, which then three trucks transporting a steep path between the trees in a warehouse in Tamansari 18 miles away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano was my whole life," says Unainik and opens his mouth wide, which is missing a few teeth.
The oldest of his five sons, 30-year, also makes mining of sulphur.
Time passes, but the continuing the misery of one of the most difficult jobs in the world remains from generation to generation - craft engaged in human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singapurci waged that do not have children, career, stress and the cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm married and I am a patriot, you are my wife and you are a patriot. Carry out our civic duty and zploďme new life.
It may seem incredible that this is part of the advertising slogan LifeSavers, but still - or perhaps because of - the video earlier this year in Singapore en masse spread on YouTube.
These sentences are part of rap, which uses local hints of "give a cake in the oven" as a mockery of birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BUT, which created the video, hopes that they will be able to draw attention to the problem of this advertising humorous way.
Artistic Director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the influence of music for people to meet "his civic duty."
"This is only a matter of the Internet, so it had to be fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we had the feeling that this is a subject which we must touch.
We knew that the government was trying to expand on a lot of things like perfume with pheromones, or organise the rehearsal dinner parties.
Many of these ideas can be creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, why not make the most creative thing, such as the composition of rap to solve this problem. "
The 1.2 children
The guy who's taking it too lightly, the Singapore government.
1 will spend $300 a year to encourage people to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to 15 000 dollars per child, extending maternity leave and allocate financial benefits.
All of these measures have had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technology in the south-east Asia, also known konzervatizmem its leaders and strict social controls.
Fertility rates in Singapore with regard to the structure of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate has exceeded the value of 2, which is considered a degree of recovery, in 1976.
Why Singapurci do not have more children?
Mingová Tan Wei, director of the department of marriage and the family of the National Bureau for the population says it's because of "better education" and "a wide range of career opportunities."
"The people that are available to a wider range of options in terms of the objectives and priorities, it is not only a marriage and family," he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to delay marriage and childbirth. The result is a reduction in fertility rates in Singapore.
While in the context of immigration policy, there were efforts to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against the decline in the number of people it has caused resentment among the local population.
Some of the Singapore's Web site to see the overt xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low salaries and a desire for integration.
Immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the last year, the Singapore government party its worst election result since the beginning of independence.
After the election, to tackle the problem by means of quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
The unexpected consequences
While the decline in birth rates are well-known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, in the case of Singapore, there were also some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to oppose so many small home.
For example, began to affect trade with real estate.
The Office for urban development began to regulate the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box" that can build in certain urban areas.
These apartments are in the area of 46 square meters and had great success in marketability.
However, there is concern that these apartments may support a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers to build a large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the developers EL Developers, claiming that their "shoe box" sold far faster than larger houses.
"They are more popular, so that they will sell for days to weeks faster than houses with bigger size.
Therefore, for our cash flow much better. "
However, he admits that the new rules are clearer rules developers, who were previously limited to offer too many small houses in one of the project.
Too stressed out
Singapore is the city-state.
Although the new rules could lead to an increase in birth rates in the nation, the conversation Singapurci working in the financial district in the city centre suggests that they will not have a big effect.
"People are still under stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, therefore, is that many people," says the young officer.
"The others to have children.
But for me, it is important to rely on their own time and money, "says another, about twenty, young man.
Men and women in her career, stress and the cost of living and education as the reasons that prevents them from having children.
So long as the government is trying to force people to have children, they are eventually Singapurci, who have the last word on the creation of a family.
What's private is private online and offline,
The privacy.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, is something that is personal in nature or the "area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any disruption."
What is this privacy for people under 16 years?
How is this definition in their daily lives and on social networks?
He understands the dangers to which it is exposed when published on the Internet, which would certainly didn't tell anyone at normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years ago, who are frequent users of the Internet.
In four cases, considered the concept of privacy as "something entirely his own" on a personal level and for "username and password," if the social network.
"It is the biggest secrets would be published," says 10-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, which accounts for two years.
"They are very secret secrets, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," he says.
"I give my nice photos or pictures of how we play.
He also said there are known.
I did not share a picture that wasn't mine, or a picture that would embarrass someone, "he says.
This boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene pictures, photographs of naked people or photographs of the crimes, or write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends on FB and their nine followers on Twitter.
Most of the relatives.
Among them is the mother, who has a name and password of one of the accounts.
"I started an account on Twitter to express their views and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if someone says to me, I just got, "added.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk with relatives who are far or fast to communicate with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
Even if he didn't care if he recommended by a stranger.
Case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager's own accounts on the network of Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask and at last the network admits that he doesn't know 20 people from your list of friends.
"I'm not afraid of that, because we have something in common, such as music," he says.
According to this boy, he didn't instruct none of them for anything, even after it didn't address or phone number.
"If I urged or required it from me, simply remove it from your account," she says.
José volunteered to Ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
The boys are not a foreign experience with what is now called cyberbullying (kyberšikana).
"The famous friends on the social network was being blackmailed.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who he was, "confirmed.
The victim, according to Jose neodhlásila from the account.
"I just activated the private mode."
After a series of steps explains how the account set up safely.
Unlike Jorge this boy published pictures of known in the unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would do it, if someone was or should I just wanted to.
Even though I know that it is cyberbullying, "he says.
The key issues
Marielos Porrasová, English teacher and graduate of the Education and teaching, believes that to children and adolescents in social networks focus properly, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is informed.
States that: "The Internet has emerged as a means for finding information, but when the social network, has changed the rules of the game."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate education at Yale University and the author of the article digital natives and digital immigrants, to introduce these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are the digital immigrants who we have to learn, and they're still learning, "he says.
He explains that this is a difficult issue, "because we ask them to distinguish what is appropriate to publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not ready for that yet."
Also to be - as regards the area - reasonable, at a time when what he wants most is to be popular, have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences, "he adds.
According to this Specialist is the most efficient way to children and adolescents to show what it's privacy, asking questions that force them to think.
"Tell them to do something, it doesn't work," he adds.
Furthermore, Marrielos Porrasová lists some of the options: There are things you told a stranger, so why are you doing on the Internet?
Or: Would you like it if someone has published a picture of you as you published a pal's?
Do you know what the other published?
When are you calling the person in the pictures of the celebrations, you asked them for permission?
And one more: They need to keep everyone to know what you're doing?
The next item is to realize that they must behave in an environment of the Internet as well as outside it.
It's the same rules.
"One out of the Internet by respect, morality and other principles and it should be on social networks," he says.
The supervision of
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a teacher in the first instance and educational consultant explains that it is necessary for the parents of children carefully read the rules of social networks.
"If we can understand every guile, have a good basis to talk with their children about the consequences that can open an account on the Internet.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to share or to publish, "he says.
 Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule "don't talk to strangers."
The summit of South America ends and the Declaration of Lima was not published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru ended today without issued the Declaration of Lima, which indicated that was allegedly signed by the seven presidents.
The agency Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but representatives of the Foreign Ministry and presidential office, who set out at the beginning that the document will be published at the end of the summit, said that will be published later on the website of the Peruvian government.
They further stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollantou Humala in a few short press statements.
Journalists have throughout the summit, limited access to information.
In the press room during the negotiations was transmitted by video from the presidential meeting without sound with the message "confidential meetings, the transmission of sound medical practice."
A small amount of information that they had available to journalists, was granted press spokesmen of some governments, who have been meeting here, but not the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document published during the negotiations, a list of participating presidents, triggering a backlash of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who demanded more information.
Peruvian presidential office later sent an e-mail to the media, "the final declaration" of the summit, but it is just an expression of President Humaly, and not an official document that the summit.
Last October, the third summit host Peru Jihoamerických and Arab countries (América del Sur-países Árabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion was originally promised the Declaration of Lima published, even though it was the press was required.
On the official website of the ASPA can find that the document was published last Tuesday.
On both international meetings to the Peruvian authorities to ensure the broadcast for all journalists, but completely stop the flow of information.
The summit was, among other things, the common commitment of Chile and Peru to the judgment of the Court of Justice of The Hague, which settles the dispute on the border between the two countries.
Peru's President Ollanta Humala and Chilean President Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which starts on Monday after hearing the defence talk of both parties to discuss the dispute, which has launched a Lima against Santiago.
"Are we going to do, and the judgment to resolve the dispute, which is now in this international court dealing with," the president said Humala, together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, conventions and international courts," said Piñera and greeted the president Humalu handshake with the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents, to submit to the decision of the International Court of Justice, was published after Colombia this week by Bogotský pact, which has expressed its commitment to the judgments of the international court, which ruled on the maritime border with Nicaragua and Colombia this decision was completely wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chavez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay has been excluded from the organization of the Unasur in 2011 after the withdrawal of former President Fernando Lugo and did not participate in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was responsible for the opening of the morning speeches and the conclusion of the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read the final document, which reported that it had taken 16 agreements and was scheduled activity on 31 projects between the South American countries, with investments amounting to 17 billion dollars.
In addition to the agreements mentioned that the member countries of the Unasur will take "important steps towards the goal in the form of a South American citizenship, which are distributed to stay."
Informed that they are supported by actions to improve "cooperation in the fight against the civil insecurity and international organised crime, better access to drugs and low-cost Internet in all corners of South America and the common and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters."
When Europe is in crisis, "does not have the economic consolidation (in Latin America) winning the substance, but is intended to increase our productivity and show a better future for our nations," said Humala.
"We decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects to improve transport links to various places in South America, especially in rural and border areas... that our country should be better connected, and create new economic ties," he said in a speech čteném Peruvian president.
He mentioned that five of these projects to Peru and the axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two are related to better link with Ecuador, however, did not give more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to her return to the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
One of the issues that the summit was the need for Latin America continue to be prosperous and peaceful area, which is solid and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, said Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos before its participation in a regional meeting that he hoped to meet in Mexico on Saturday with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega to discuss with respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice on the dispute on the maritime border, which is disputed by Bogotou.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) will meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will discuss all the solution, neither are not excluded, no agreement with Nicaragua, which would require negotiations with that country," he said.
"I hope I will be able to say to the President Ortega, who led the negotiations to the more civilized and kindest possible form," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico, where they are to attend the inauguration of President Enriqueho Peñi Niety.
At the summit, the EU defence ministers provisionally met to approve an action plan for the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus in the defense field.
Unasur members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam, Paraguay, although the last of the country is currently excluded.
Peru's temporary chairman of the regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn from the integration of Europe
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, today announced that the creation of a common citizenship is the objective, "South America, in this case, you must learn from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the sixth presidential summit Jihoamerické Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television TV Perú that Europeans' killed in World War II, "and in other conflicts," but now they are virtually one country. "
In this sense, defended the project of creating a South American citizenship, which member countries of the Unasur support.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in the context of any South American country, which is already underway between the members of the Andean Community, however, there are still backward areas that we want to return to the past," he said.
Ecuador's president, among other things, that he agrees with the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the impact of the Anglo-Saxon countries will be reduced and take into account those who have signed the Pact of San Jose on human rights.
"Those who are in the lead, never came to nothing, and we all signed the South Americans.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington is financed by the United States, "he said, referring to the political asylum from Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa has confirmed that he has no regrets about this decision, because it betrayed its principles, and his "deep respect for democratic values and human rights."
He said that at the time "there was reason to suspect that Assange could be extradited to a third country without regard to the ongoing process."
In addition, criticized the Swedish justice, who asked him to submit to questioning on Swedish territory for an alleged sexual offence, "the Swedish legislation enables the questioning videokonferenčním conversation, which could be taken from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."
Correa has said that there is a risk that Assangeho of deterioration in the physical and mental health.
"I haven't talked to him since he's in the embassy, and the ambassador has informed me that he has a small lung problems, but nothing serious," said Ecuadorean head of state.
"There is, however, that his physical and psychological condition deteriorates because it is locked in a small space without the possibility of movement in the fresh air.
That would have affected the health of each, "he said.
President Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted Assange since June still earlier Ecuadorian Embassy in London, on the basis of the permit, which allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, and stressed that the London talks to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We're not negotiating on human rights, in this case, we don't use that word, but still continued talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, because the lawyer Assangeův Baltazar Garzón leads the series of proceedings in the various European bodies, "he said.
He said that "if the United Kingdom will leave tomorrow, it's all over."
And if Sweden to hear Mr Assangeho still earlier Ecuadorian Embassy in London or via Skype, as no problem for the legislation, as has been done in other cases, tomorrow will be an end to this problem. "
Correa took advantage of this situation to be presented as a defender of freedom of the press, and made clear that he does not tolerate "podprůměrnost, bad intentions and lie, which undermine freedom of expression."
The biggest enemies of a free press is not us, mean-spirited and vicious politicians, but bad news in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail, "he said.
From this point of view, expressed pleasure at the fact that no such journalists, "neither bankers nor hegemonic countries and even the bourgeoisie control over Ecuador," and said that, if re-elected, "will continue the changes brought the right way and in the right direction."
President Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto by Paraguay on membership in the Union Unasur, at least until its next elections, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not to tolerate opportunism and pučismus wrapped in the legality," because in fact "destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy."
In addition, Ecuador's president, said that it is "entirely appropriate" the wishes of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, at a time when the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which ruled in favor of Nicaragua.
At the moment, the judgment is not accepted.
"It is a problem between the South American and-countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome will walk together.
It is widely considered to have been overcome, and was able to go forward. "
It also expressed the hope for a settlement of the dispute on the maritime border, which deals with the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "the right to search for Latin America is an international resort, where the two countries commit themselves to accept the judgment, whether it be as hard."
In connection with the possibility that he may run in the next presidential election in Ecuador, in order to run for a third mandate, said that he sees this possibility "with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he would retire from public life.
"I personally never cared much, but so unfair situations, such as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, can only make political power.
My political movement believed that I who ensures that likely victory, so we have to accept this responsibility, "he said.
"If I had won, it would be my last presidential term, and then I went from politics.
If we lose, it's the same thing.
I've decided, "he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolásem Madurem, who says that President Chávez went to the planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
It is not a relapse in the state of health of the president, "he said.
The head of the Ecuadorian state is now part of the sixth Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was ended by calling for greater regional integration in order to maintain the development, equality and security.
The AIDS victims are the result of the late diagnosis
Fabriziovi was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of his test: HIV-positive.
"It was like a lightning struck me," says the memory of the moment of truth, which the doctor was trying to "help mitigate," but apparently without success.
Before the boy's family kept.
He decided to take his illness on their shoulders and began to inform about it. And with such commitment that celebrated the 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the earliest patients Units of HIV in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after a battle with the disease.
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 years, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and greater stigma.
At that time, the director of the clinic with him or the Social Security Institute (IMSS) say, "because he was cut."
Then have AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and fully live.
It is, however, a lot of people don't know about his illness and they come when the virus caused the destruction of the body and vysílil immune system, and then they become victims of random infections.
31 years since AIDS emerged in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "is a great success that the life expectancy of a patient in a timely and appropriate manner to begin with, it is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, Head of Unit of HIV in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara with the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Infektolog and an expert on HIV / AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists concluded that since 2008, AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and full of life depends on the degree of disability, the immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease, the better are those who are taking drugs: People with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years, and people with 500 CD4 cells for up to 50 years.
Simply put, it means that those who are HIV diagnosed in 25 years, according to these findings "in compliance with the treatment to live up to 75 years without any problems," he said in an interview.
To underline this progress, it is worth recalling that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although the mortality rate has declined significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who have died from AIDS, from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (yearbook of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS (UNAIDS), it is also true that since the discovery of AIDS, according to the national statistics, 60 percent of patients.
In the state of Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and in May, 187. However, since 2005, is a universal access to antiretroviral therapy.
 - Why do people continue to die from the effects of the disease?
 - "It seems to me that the problem is not the possibilities of access to treatment.
The way I see it, that's going on with us in the hospital.
At least for the last 12 years, we have not run out of supplies of medicines. The problem is that patients are at a very advanced stage, because they don't know the status of the disease, which in the late stage of the disease. "
Adds compelling figure: "Nine out of ten patients comes when there will be some associated infections. What needs to be done, so we can have more impact on the overall death rate is to diagnose the disease earlier and, therefore, it should be on a large scale to offer tests for the disease to all persons who request it."
In its proposal coincides with experts and officials from the State Council for the prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who had come to a private lab tests to do just that it was his friend, and despite his young age he had erupted also suffered from AIDS and Kaposi s sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the most common complications.
"Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I have to die, I'd better vyřádím three times a week," they say, but it's not my case.
The change was for the better, healthy eating, exercise, take medicine. "
To this day, his parents knows only that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but responsibly, I pay attention to himself and to the other person, "lists Fabrizio, who accepted an invitation to share their experiences with the daily Milenio Jalisco that today, in the context of World AIDS Day motivated their testimony of those who are worried.
"Whatever they do tests. If the risk, so let them know as soon as possible, if they are HIV positive, it's better. And if they were diagnosed, whether they realize that they can live like anyone else, they will be held accountable."
This sums up his message to the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Among the programs for health and ordinary citizens is a big gap, said Ricardo Salazar, guadalajarský journalist who reveal information about the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps in the prevention.
In places, which is dedicated to this task "is actually increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, give us the packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Nejnáchylnějšími among the new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want?" Is a common question full of irony and assessment from social workers, school counselors, employees of pharmacies and medical staff, adolescents want to avoid, says a reporter.
He suggested this inefficient distribution change. Condoms are not just behind the counters, but the hundred dávkovačích whatever is in public restrooms, where young people often.
"It's not promoting promiscuity.
"It's not to pay them a beer and a motel," as Governor Emilio Gonzalez responded to the question of whether he agreed with the distribution of preservatives in his district.
Takovásexualita. The best is to make condoms to those who had sex life, "he said.
The key figures in the state of Jalisco
There have been 13 435 cases (12 158 cases of AIDS and HIV-1, 317 cases).
This is the fourth place in Mexico in the new and recorded cases of AIDS and the 13th place in the context of HIV.
92% of diseases in a sexual way, 6% of blood on the way y 2% perinatálně.
It is estimated that can live with the HIV virus, about 50,000 people, because on the one registered case is four to five people who don't know about the disease.
The ruling by the court of the United States, which does not recognise the restructuring of the debt of the company Grupo Vitro set by the bankruptcy in Mexico, a disastrous precedent for any national enterprise with offices in a neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
Therefore, it seems that the procedures of the restructuring of firms that allow Mexican laws in the country lanes and stars, despite international agreements.
The approval of a decision by 15 June last year, a judge Harlinem Hal in bankruptcy court for North Texas leaves in practice the Mexican companies without a defense against the possibility of confiscation of their property on the other side of the river el Bravo.
However, the ruling opens the door to the Mexican producers of glass to the Supreme Court of the United States, with an appeal against the three irregularities.
First of all, it should be noted that while the judge in this case alleges that the creditors have to drive the Insolvency Act of the United States, the court of appeal of the Fifth District, based in New Orleans, says that the procedure provides for bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, it would suggest a lack of international legal cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational companies.
In fact, it was for this purpose, the United Nations created a model for the unification of international trade law, which specifies the organisation arbiter of the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the ruling states that without a vote of branches of the internal corporate structure, which is recognised by the debt of the parent company Vitro to branches, would not have reached the required majority to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility of Mexican laws allow.
The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first in which it was adopted this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose transfer debts guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Technology.
In addition, it is true that even after deducting branches would vote against the company Vitro creditors - who stood in court in the United States, i.e. the funds "vultures," such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - not the majority.
In the vote would have about 45 percent to 37.
This figure does not take into account the court of appeal.
From another point of view, blaming the company Vitro from a difficult situation, which has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that struck in the United States.
In the meantime, the family firm González Sady lodges an appeal for reconsideration of the Court of Appeal to the examination was carried out with the full participation, with the participation of the five judges, as originally voted only three.
If he fails here, will require a revision of the appeal process more instances, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.
In this case, it is significant that the court failed to document sent to the Mexican government as the amicus curiae, which is described in detail the company Vitro under bankruptcy law, in which he points out that the company had eased by adhered to the agreements signed by the two countries that confronted the law with Chapter 15 of the insolvency of the United States.
Navícse points out that the country has subjected the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules for international cases of insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
The impact on both sides: The punishment for the company Vitro and the state.
The overall evaluation
Unnoticed lay on the table a few months of criminal charges against the former owner of the aviation company Gastónu Azcárraga Andrademu, who was accused of fraud, and according to the pilots' unions have already overflowed.
The panel, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineauem had filed a complaint to the National Banking and Securities Commission, which has accused of obstruction of justice.
According to her, the Authority systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor of the Republic of transactions made by an entrepreneur, in which the bank IXE from fideikomisu F / 589 picked on behalf of the Mexican Aviation 198 million pesos.
The funds were likely to be directed to buy shares Professional hotel management (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
As is well known, Azcárraga Andrade is the majority shareholder in the chain of hotels posadas.
The siege of Dragon Mart
In the area of the Universidad de Caribe, at the weekend meeting of the Group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, business people and ordinary citizens, who approved the creation of the association, in order to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Kankúnu.
We're talking, of course, about the huge trade and distribution center with products from countries with a "wall" aimed at Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would be at the bottom of a residential zone for the staff of 150 companies.

"Héctor" Hetin Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
"The basketball world traveler Héctor" Hetin Reyes was linked with this Salo sport more than 60 years and traveled to the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico has so many memories on the history of the local basketball, as the "Héctor" Hetin Reyes.
Reyes was before he was caught by a stroke in 2008 in a wheelchair, dedicated to this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player under the category, a player of the National Basketball League BSN, owner and trainer Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the National Basketball League, or the president Portorické basketball federation.
"I was in the course of his life in basketball a lot of roles, including several at the same time, like when I was in the 1990s, president of the National League for BSN, general manager and president of the Federation of the national team," said Reyes when visiting reporters from the newspaper Primera Hora at his home in Bayamónu, where he lived for more than 50 years, Isabel, his faithful wife.
"Basketball has been my life."
Reyes in his statement wasn't exaggerating.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with pictures and souvenir of his long career, show it.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest affection of all are those that are reminiscent of his tenure at los Vaqueros since the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he celebrated 15 years as co-owner or the owner of the team.
"It was my best years, I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to be with the team los Vaqueros from 1967 to participate in the eight championships, either as the owner, the co-owner or trainer.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held in the years from 1971 to 1975.
And then I got one playoff farewell - in 1981, when he made his debut in BSN Jerome Mincy.
Then the team took "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an outstanding leader, "said Reyes.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who was previously the coach, and by the time he was at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said to me:" I have a 6-foot player.
Do you want it? "
And that was the beginning of Mincyho, one of the best players ever to Puerto Rico.
I then recommended Bartow rozehrávače Raymond Gausseho, who became a member of the team, and one of our best shooters.
I remember that he said that if Mincy Bayamonu will bring victory in the championship, Gausse then will contribute to further. "
The championship, when he played for the team los Vaqueros Gausse, enjoy, but only at a distance, because in 1988, has pursued the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to devote his functions and enjoy Mincyho location in the national team.
"I remember the first time we beat the United States in the Olympic qualification match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we left off, but we have a bronze, but for that of the Canadian panel, who let us repeat the final face-off, "said Reyes.
A team from the World Cup in 1990, the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, as well as the one that beat the Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was the national team in Panamerických games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold, and we whippin team of the United States, which was quite similar to that we blew bronze at the World Cup.
The team should not only Mincyho, Gausseho, Ramona Rivase, Fico Lopez and "Piculína" (Ortiz), but also there were young men (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers Leónové (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 because of knee injuries.
The team, which may not be perfect, but we managed to win the gold medal and bring great joy, a team from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in Argentine Neuquénu.
With the players on the roster, such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who had replaced the players ruled out because of the fighting in Panamerických Games in Mar de Plata, despite all the predictions, we won the gold.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
It was without any doubt Piculín Ortiz.
The number of international tournaments are impressive.
No one from Puerto Rico achieved at this level of such results as Piculín.
Not to mention his tenure in different leagues, where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
It is very difficult.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
The young, I very much like the work Leo Arilla.
His success in the federation, is the biggest?
I was part of that era's most famous national team from 1988 to 1995, and that in the early 1990s was National League BSN in one season to 17 teams.
 What you couldn't prove it?
There were things that I wanted to introduce, as the division of youth categories according to the regions.
For example, that the boys from Ponce played only in its field and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now the kids a lot of travel and play too many matches, which is not necessary.
I also see benefits in the compulsory certification and training courses for coaches, referees and assistant referees.
I am pleased.
What are you now?
Most I listen to music, watch YouTube videos with the music of my time, I'm enjoying grandchildren and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And, of course, I'm enjoying the company of his wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.

Hagmanovi was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he himself admitted that he drank a lot of years.
In 1995, he was found a malignant tumor in the liver and Hagman underwent the transplant.

But it was up to Hangmanův master performance in the form of an incredibly repellent J.R., who led him to the top.
The dramatic series on CBS station clan Ewingů and other personalities around them was transmitted from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who shot J.R.?," which was to raise expectations on the part of the full of emotion, when Hangmanova figure is almost killed not only caused a huge range of speculation viewers around the world, but also the risk-taking millions of dollars in sazkových offices.

Kristin with J.R. became pregnant and that she then threatened to mark her as a prostitute, if he leaves town. But there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, insatiable charizmatickým greedy with a smile: Wily entrepreneurs and faithless husband, who was trying to make his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, was closed to the hospital.
"I know what I want to have J.R. on the tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
There should be: 'Here lies upright citizen J.R. Ewing. "
This is the only thing he didn't work.
Victoria Principalová, who played in the original series, recalled Friday at Hagmana as someone who was "a great on the screen and beyond."
It's an unforgettable and indispensable for millions of fans in the world and in the hearts of all of us who are lucky enough to know him and love.

The course, which examines the "end of the world."
Every week, the students are studying apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When the religion professor Stuart Charmé decided that he would do this semester course on the end of the world, he knew it was an irresistible lure: The end of "a number of" Mayského calendar, which has come on December 21, caught many people as proof that the world is coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what was waiting for him in the next few months: The catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget gap, which some call "debt Armageddon," and the growing conflict in which Israel is involved, the place where Christians teoretizujících by the end of the world to the Apocalypse.
"I didn't realize that this will be nejapokalyptičtější semester, ever," said Charmé students this week Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey.
When a man, what is happening today in the world, as if we had 30 days, it's really a good time.
And remember, that is bad for the apocalyptic-minded good.
And it is not the only professor, which offers courses on the "end of the world" in this semester, which is, in theory, the last in history.
At the University of Temple, assistant professor Barry vacker course "Means, culture and the end of the world."
Every week, the students are studying apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We discuss these thoughts are with time," he says, and offer a hypothetical scenarios that are governed by a human behavior.
For example, if the nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, the war could erupt.
This month, students analyze films with apokalyptickými themes and examine how they differ from the examples from real life.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible," says vacker.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania got together, a professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solariová, assistant professor of art history and anthropology to hold course with a simple name of the End of the World.
"Nepřipojujeme" 2012, "because we are always with the possibility of a rate again in the event that the world ends," said Restall.
Despite the "imminent destruction" to students to study, develop projects and make final exams.
At Penn State's final test will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which makes the students no option but to work "in the evening of the end of the world," said Restall.
The courses have become quite popular.
"Spread within two hours," said Restall of its course for students with a high average, which had 35.
For weeks and weeks before the start of the semester we received e-mail questions whether it is still in place.
The students have been assured that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to console ourselves," she said at Rutgers University in Camden 23letá Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology of Haddonfield, New Jersey.
And, therefore, the apocalyptic, secular or religious beliefs, it is only a matter of comfort or lack of it.
Will Wekesa, 25 year-old student of psychology and nursing, said that he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of an hour in which it could teach," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no vyzpovídaný student or professor, said that he believes in the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project was about the Mayan predictions and vyvracíme it in some way," said Julie Zeglenová, 21letá student at Temple University in West Chester.
"The Mayans never had not foreseen the end of the world; it is a key point in the calendar," said Restall.
But he added that in Western culture is an apocalyptic anxiety that goes back centuries in which people respond to changes in their environment predictions about the end of the world.
Such speculation has caused the Internet to flourish.
"People don't think it elsewhere," he said.
This is happening in the vast majority in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, on the question of whether there is a course on the "end of the world," he answered quickly.
"The Philippines is not the end of the world," he wrote, and suggested an exception for the highest office.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall said that during the years of the last days of the court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start thinking about the next date immediately," or philosophy that 21 December is the start of a seven-year period, at the end of the world.
Date take lightly the students and professors.
Several of them said that they intend to go to the festival "the end of the world."
"I guess I'll call a few friends, we laughed together," explained the twenty-year-old communications student Samir Ford.
