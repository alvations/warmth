That is what happens? CSSD knows neither Voldemort or pastry making in Prague.
The newly-elected representatives of CSSD á the town hall in the capital will have to overcome seemingly genuine linguistic barrier to understand themselves on the city council to their old and new colleagues of the ODS.
The Actualne.cz newspaper "tested" the new members of the city council pertaining á CSSD, á whether they know the slang who was born in recent years, á the town hall, when they were partners in the current coalition who led á Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the cream of Prague began during the previous era of mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the figures, situations, and the metropolis.
It is surprising that it was discovered that the newly-elected officials do not understand the terms known well.
At least they say.
"That is Valdemort."
"I really do not know."
"I am a young fellow in politics pragoise reacted Lukas Kaucky, elected to nurture a test of the vocabulary of "the godfather."
And about the political veteran, elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the "hole in golf."
"It is the only phrase among those who you propose to me that I use"
If not, I do not use slang.
Vocabulary, Aktualne.cz newspaper published the phrases in June this year before pre-éĺectoral congress ODS, drafting chose 6 examples, primarily those who are linked with city hall of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort," "the biggest hole golf á Prague," to á pastry making," "beef nerve," "betrayal of capital" and "fleece."
Three elected officials have agreed to quiz, fourth Antonin Weinert, who must run education á Prague in the future --promised an interview at first, then the phone did not take down.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek straightforwardly refused the test.
"I do not care at all these things lá and representatives of democracy citizen have fun. I will not deliver my opinion."
"I now deal with the manner in which we understand ourselves within the framework of our programs," T he has responded.
As we have heard, the elected official Lukas Kaucky apparently does not recognize the caption above, it is influential Janousek on entrepreneurs and friends of the ex-mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" does not tell á' Kaucky and the only speech that he guessed the test is "the biggest hole golf á Prague."
"It is the Blanka tunnel" says Kaucky and adds immediately. "But I know newspapers."
"I will have to pay me a language class," T joke it.
Not only matador Karel Brezina but as Lukas Plachy, elected for the environment, know as the hole in golf is the tunnel of Blanko.
Both social democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find a character - he thinks within the meaning of "to pastry making."
"It acts, I think, to visit a company," Plachy is willing to guess that it is the seat of the companies Janousek.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that he rather draws its knowledge of newspapers and not from any vocabulary that it would use.
According to the candidates for the tests there is no lexicon of slang in social democracy.
"I took advice with colleagues and it appears that we do not really have something of this kind."
"Rather says the names some time you use abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, Chairman of the Party socio-democrat, that Party members call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school but I do not know if my colleagues call me like that, Karel Brezina about the nicknames acknowledges.
The Actuel.cz newspaper tested the name and he goes.
The Weinert elected official is Papy for members of the Party or the least friendly Little Old Man, the representative, Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the election by swindles for sponsoring party, is called "small toy."
The nicknames are the only ones that within the party, the social democrats admit to use.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda, but Akutel.cz newspaper recorded another nickname for this president pragois.
"Doctor of Laws bludgeon" recalls appears that Petr Hulinsky got his title. JUDr Doctor of Laws to the police academy in Bratislava.
The government wants to reduce torture "witches," a booklet published.
In Burkina Faso, said women witch refer common.
They form part of the older generation rather, can not work, for example for health reasons, are free and do not have a child.
That becomes "witch" is not isolated to threaten the rest of the village.
"The man very rarely has this fate."
"We do not judge either young women in good health because they take part in work and are confined to the children," declares a sister who occupies herself in the capital of this country in West Africa, Burkina Faso, in a special establishment of more than 100 women who were rejected by society.
Local government decided to intervene against these unusual "social measures."
He published a booklet which should help to limit hunting for witches.
The case involves "difficulty."
"More than 70 of adults in Burkina Faso can not read," the newspaper Die Standard in connection with the downside of written about education.
The head of sorcery is common in other countries in Africa.
In Ghana, near Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma woman, a 72 year old died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil that they had sprinkled.
It is the waiter of the BBC who relayed this information.
The criminals say that it was the evil eye.
According to their version oil is used for ritual oilings is emflammée in contact with the woman.
Oil flamed, it seems, when the team wanted to "drive out the bad spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "the witches" is approved by people of all levels of education.
Standard newspaper DER quoted a 42 year old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso. "The eaters of human minds still posed a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is trying to chase down to the witches, Gambia not later than last year even the President himself participating in it.
"Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a large hunting for witches, it seems, would have taken part in her death and would have tried by black magic to kill the President."
"Shamans in Guinea to come to the rescue, to the tough presidential election with Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and personal guardian of the President, men and women randomly chosen in villages in Gambia," a message, "Amnesty International said.

International pressure it is about a thousand people who were given in freedom.
The tenant of Bakal. The poèles heat, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man left by the door the center clients the company RPG Byty "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of the apartments to be commended the Czech Republic.
It brought under the arm file with three new hiring agreements for three apartments. his, her daughter and her son, who is mind to purge a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent in these three people.
Instead of paying the 3500 sons will have to pay as from next year for an apartment 2+1 second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is no warm water and heating runs on solid fuel," finger on the new agreement of his son shows the man who has the power of signature.
"But I signed," explains T it motié angry and half resigned.
The association citizen of the BytyOKD.cz apartments that described the nouelles terms of hiring as "immoral and indecent," advises the tenants to sign and wait until December 7th, when it will be published a note to explain the way forward to claim.
But the man reacts to that of an epic of hand.
"It says that, the other says another thing" by wrinkling the eyebrows.
The Ostrava becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, it is what waits most apartment in the Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond to the market.
Aktualne.cz for this reason decided to visit the laboratory "personally."
The waiting room RPG in the street Havirovska is one of four in the region of Ostrava and it is already full Tuesday at 09 o'clock in the morning.
Just beside the door a guard is a company with a security apparatus to customers.
A special button, "rent 2011," is enlightened on the touch screen.
One pressure and a paper with a number suggests the apparatus.
You do not have time to read your number "157" your number already beginning to be illuminated on the big screen in the topit the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it is your turn.
After a short time, an elderly couple was able to get information about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to worry people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to solve current problems like everywhere - demand for repairs, events about insurance and others.
In the region of Ostrava, more than 44000 apartments in the portfolios of RPG receive the mails with the new lease agreements in their letter-box from about mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes to increases in rent from 15 to 38.
the counter for the new rents is open to the public since November 18th.
"it works for nearly a week, so it is still the test" answers, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the client is presented in the form of a journalist.
The deragulation and apartments former miners Bakal is a very important local issue.
The vice-president of the Parliament and from the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the social democrats in the state in a sustained way before the election and that fills now the local newspapers.
"after 20 years, I want a new floor."
"They did not even change me you could... N of board in the WC, to relieve the man mentioned.
However, it is, according to employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a rebate on the new price of rent if they sign far as promised RPG in a special offer.
It is a rebate half the amount of rent that others will receive loctaires will have signed a new agreement before December 15th.
But the counter "deregulation" street Havirovaska is really not burdened by the questions.
"Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for the rent," the employee indicates the counter.
Yet RPG porpose so much on its website than in the windows of individual talks on rents when it is needed.
If the two sides do not get along on the praise it is an independent tribunal that will make the decision.
'They are not threats but only to inform on the road and legitimate acting legally," RPG indicates on its website.
"Nobody here will go to court," believes one of the workers Byty RPG and the man in the street in front of the center of customers gives him reason.
"I have 13000 crowns of retirement and there remain to 5000 crowns to eat, I do not have to go to the court," he said.
The employee feels suddenly ill uncomfortable.
"We will see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media that requires no sign so people wait," indicates T it.
Regulation of rents finishes in the Czech Republic to early 2011 and rising, according to RPG Byty, an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rents still do not reach the level needed for simple maintenance funds for housing," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of residential portfolios of society RPG Byty, it is precisely the neglect of the funds for housing that makes the tenant in anger is the main reason for the increase in rent.
But in the 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG could to invest in rents apartments 4 billion in four years 2011, 2014, should make 5.2 billion.
The big screen clinging to the ceiling opposite the stuffed armchairs in the waiting room of the street Havirosvka, but repeats some information indicated in red.
'The increase in rent in 2011 of 15 and is not less than 31200 apartments is more than 90 percent of the apartments RPG."
"And it will always be with the 7.50 Czech crowns the square m per month," screen indicates.
The 38 increase is only 400 apartments in the portfolios of RPG.
"In these cases, it is an increase in the amount really very low 19.66 Czech crowns with the m square," RPG adds.
Next year, the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase from 4 to 8.
It adds other commitments. all the money the increase in rents (cf the figure is returned to the apartment in the form of savings in the heating, new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the increase in rent have priority.
The nursery school also forms part of the offices included architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint of Brno is the new seat of society. arch Design.
Nobody could have expected it also houses a mini nursery school with all that is necessary - walls of colors, furniture, imaginative toys and a miniature playing field on the terrace.
Since October last year, can go there children of employees. arch design.
The company project-architectonic arch. Design. the workshops produced a large number of construction in Brno, its mini nursery school of business imagined from the first outlines of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially in the age for children and it mattered to him that women architects and project managers can soon return to work.
At the same time as the tenure at reduced time, the nursery school is a proposed bonuses to its employees by society. arch Design. as part of its program.
Manufacturers and architects have the possibility of combining a fascinating work to care for the children.
They are employees the same ones who imagined this nursery school and with the backing of the direction they could get an equipment and the Ministry Of Labor and social affairs.
The mini nursery school is funded through the Funds For A European Company through the operational program of human resources and official Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the endowments of funding (to the tune of 2.8 mil.de Czech crowns). They could buy equipment and equipment and after two years to ensure a skilled personnel as well as the startup.
After the use of the equipment financing (two years) company. arch Design. the bond is after 3 years to make it work mini nursery school in the capital.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and the Economy rating that helped make the demand for equipment.
Care for the children is secured by a skilled personnel, every day, a nurse and a teacher of nursery school business with children. children can go to nursery school without limitation of age but they have more than three anspour the majority.
As there is a "mini nursery school" he can be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who are replaced.
The school is flexible needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school without look at the hierarchical position.
Although it is an individual care and education program of the mini nursery school is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children do not where to play but a teacher quality is also assured there - start until the run-up to the benches of a school teaches English.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time to control their child to have the stress of a delay to go to children in a school away from the workplace of the parents.
Parents to use their working hours in the most productive way.

The house in bone fascine again after 100 years. Throw an eye indoors of Gaudi.
The roof resembles on the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase with a backbone of dinosaur and balconies with fish open mouths.
So is the house Casa Battlo in Barcelona of the architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house received on the part of the buildings the nickname House in bone.
Organic forms, wild colors, use of unusual stones, fragments of squares and mosaîque façade, pointing out of balance and present curves, here everything is ypic for the Art Nouveau of Antoni Gaudi.
The frontal façade of the house unrolls his lines dream, pleasant colors and textures that recall nature and animals.
For a more detailed observation one sees the geometry, the pace and order thinking with precision.
At night the façade of the house becomes even more dramatic and enlightened in such a way that the impression of brightness of colors is reinforced with it.
The rolling up and torsion of the forms also be indoors with the same measure.
Wood copies in the waves windowframes, balustrades, decorative elements of the doors, the eyepiece and plates.
The Battlo house is drawn up in the Eixample district in commercial street Passeig of Gracia to the number. 43, was born in building a house of 1877 of the architect Emilio Sala the Cortes.
Reconstruction has been done for two years and the house over in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, initially insisted on the demolition of the old building and construction of another any news but quickly accepted the idea of Gaudi of unusual reconstruction and cheaper.
But the idea of Being Battlo an apartment building was thought by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that were born decorations for an apartment from representation of the owner of the building and the use of mosaîque for the façade.
The façade also worked with other artists and creators.
Common work for the plans house Casa Battlo begin with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and park Guell in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The buildings called the hot house just after its completion because of its organic forms "House in bone."
Others, in view of specific mechanism of opening the windows called it "the house that bucket."
It is said that at the peak of construction there is a sword similar to that of St. George, the owner of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture of building containing hidden religious reasons.
Gaudi thought to house a single system in its central warming-up time, vents of ventilation and typical chimneys.
Their slope of 45 degrees seems bizarre.
During Gaudi was absolutely did not respect the guidelines of building second and did not allow itself to block them.
At the beginning of construction he got on the part of the city construction permit, knowing, of course that data related to reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after completion over the city council was horrified and asked for changes.
He did not like, for example, with members of the city council that the pillars of construction empiettent on the pavement.
There was never change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo requested (and received) satisfaction authorization rent two more stages.
The owner moved on the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and a third bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was lauded with a jewellery.
The house of six floors is divided by a staircase by one reaches an independent of roof terrace.
All the angles and lines run-up to have been cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also shaped the modern idea of linking spaces.
The common part can be connected entirely by opening the doors of living rooms and high society can communicate comfortable or limit private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi received in addition to new frontages a non-traditional roof and two steps in.
The game of Gaudi with the light is also impressive, blue and white tiles with glossy which is decorated the court and wells of enlightenment.
The game with two colors to a maximum of light across the floors of the house.
It was just enough to bet on the principle that the white reflête more than sinks it that, on the contrary, absorbs the rays of the sun.
The house Has Battlo which was registered in 2005 in the World Heritage of UNESCO perhaps visited by each.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious apartment and most beautiful accessible to the public.
Owners decided to cross this step in 2002 at the 150ème anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued visits because they noted that it is a lucrative business, and they expanded the field of visits to common spaces and attic including the terraces of the roof.
The entry ticket to the monument is not expensive and costs 16.50 euros. students, retirees, and holders of touristic maps have 20 reduction.
The sum is still above the entrance fee in other construction of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel real atmosphere of the house with his fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among residents of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and diagrid. women have other criteria that men.
Pas de tallies ostentatious, but rather the surface quality reserved for sleeping, so the mattress and diagrid provide a basis for a bed.
Must of course be complementary to harmoniously as a concrete user.
During the several things are crucial, saidthe weight, size, age and health status and gender of the owner.
The interior in which one will place the mattress and diagrid is also important.
A typical example?
For example in the country home where you do not sleep continuously a latex mattresses are not appropriate because they are "heated" slowly.
They have, in addition, a weight higher than the standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is often necessary to return them.
If they do not have enough ventilating ducts in the middle and if they are, moreover, on a board, they retain moisture. Mold can also be formed.
The practice is also crucial in the choice.
That is the light of time abroad when you frequently uses very thick mattresses with a softening layer, will feel of course difficult to low and hard surface.
"All hokeyists who return from NHL feel sorry for that they can not sleep there."
"For their weary shoulders, feet and coasts, they needed mattress with a softening layer of foam lazy."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes, which has a disorder of the nervous system so badly has assumed "information" articulations and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova that specializes in the stuffed furniture.
So there is a few years the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hokeyists as well as other customers.
"Now everything is working well, Tempur, Italian Magnifex but also Czech Tropico have appropriate for example, mattresses.
You do not need to be a guy of NHL to be able to enjoy a lazy foam.
This "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and his form in absorbed the heat or adapts to the warmth of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you will not be returned in the night and after a difficult match.
You simply sleep better.
Lazy foam also functions as a protection against esquarres.
The choice of mattress in your size, add the length of the feet, roughly 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman is a size of 180cm need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum size for each for a double bed should be 90 cm in all 180 cm.
For beds in one room, individual, for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 cm /140.
It is a good time to visit.
'But it is a simple rule for the size of the bed. when you are lies on the back you should pose the hands in a comfortable way to the slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Harness-maker-mattress makers and decorators who have dedicated themselves for several years to problems in healthy sleep and ergonomics furniture and sign in the specialized schools.
For a double bed each needs its own diagrid and mattress, so attention but during achât to the tune of the mattress.
Otherwise it will only are you a wedge between the diagrid different heights and that is not feasible at all executives of bed.
The foam mattresses should have minimal the tune of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, that matter for ventilation and subgrade at least three centimeters.
"The touch or sitting position on the mattress you should not feel springs," Héléna Prokopova prevents.
Each mattress requires a well-defined kind of diagrid.
The bed-diagrid, when the mattress and diagrid are united as Siamese twins, does not have anything to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are aired very badly. one should not wash, which is usually made auhourd' today.
And during the night we perspires normally from 0.2 to 0.75 L of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress is to recall a great (and arrested) sieve.
For scholars refuse to make announcement over 25 years of life for a mattress or guarantee for life.
But its very but.
And for that reason, a council of experience on the part of the sellers. for a mattress of 120/140cm, abandon, coating the mattress, hygiene or washing but add a mattress protection rather than easily vouspouvez to withdraw and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to produce coatings with zipper for unity, i.e that after opening the two sides (for washing and the size of a washing machine, it is important!) if not for manipulating the models (and one person) becomes when it withdraws them a fight between a slight weight and a heavyweight in a boxing ring.
Do you have in your bed a rigid board instead of a diagrid?
Never!
The maximum for a bed for the visitors only for one night.
But equip board (if there is no) air vents and use the spring mattress with minimal the tune of 15cm with springs of sachets (Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of ventilation.
A polyurethane mattress should not belong to a bed of this type.
For diagrids with plates with unique position to 14/18 plates, latex mattresses or known as sandwiches (perhaps combination of latex and coconut), are the ideal but will always be better for you to have a mattress with more plates, 28 and above, where the plates are doubled in the bottom of the kidneys and that it is possible to control rigidity.
For the mattresses with several positions should not take spring mattress because it does not address the change of position.
Beside the adjustment of the rigidity of the plates can also install what it calls a cradle of shoulder.
It is a special connection of the plates that allows pressure even incline the board to shoulder the sleeper "integrated."
For men who have "shoulders as wide as the back," it is really an important thing.
This thing is already considered by the producers of mattresses that for "masculines" began to use a zone softening of the shoulders.
But they also think women - they again give them a softer surface on the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are diagrids with wings or plates with what it calls a suspension multiforce.
The pressure is disseminated in points and diinue the tension.
But, of course, attention, as soon as you use a pillow bad (and inflated air) on good mattresses and diagrid "more" disappears.
The basic rule is a very simple pillow. the pillow should support the head and points to reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The size recommended is 50X60 cm that the Scandinavians by exmple prefer.
When you are lying on the pillow to level (the cradle of shoulder of diagrid or the eurozone eased in the mattress) the tune of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first containing straw and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural questions or many mixtures.
The trend is also the organic mattress.
Raw materials containing oil, from which the polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as the soybean oil.
Almost all known precisely manufacturers use soybean.
"The Bio qualifier for the mattresses means that the soul is manufactured containing natural products," Petr vasicek company Tropico Plus explains.
Natural questions are also used for coatings of mattresses. one of the first was the aloe vera will.
But you can add to it microphone-capsules that develop perfumes in the forest and lavender.
There are differences between the man and the woman.
While the extract of plants of birch so that the coating of mattress absorbs heat and cools the body, "kills" the man, the coatings "heat" women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weaker sex.
The current favorite?
The mattresses made from cold foam (they have more pores with so disrupted cellular structure more breathing that the standard polyurethane and more elasticity.
The combination of various rigidities cold gives foam mattresses polyzones who know precisely where is the head, the bottom of the back and feet.
You will pay a mattress quality from 7000 crowns and more.
Those which are characterized by their parameters for health have less VAT and are taken as instruments of health.
The Czech Republic is Gumotex reached the first place.
Save for the mattress and diagrid is not simple.
One may from time to time have a special actions on the part of producers and producers two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze with foam mattresses with Memory memory bent with the coating to 11990 crowns.
We can clearly be the second free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foam with an open cell structure and a thickness was started with the Tempur matter "cosmic" pace.
It began as a matter for NASA because the astronauts were at the beginning of the enormous burden factors.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens, on the contrary, a cold.
It adapts to a warm human body and distributes to an optimal pressure.
It is for that perfect against evil slept and an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam used not only for the mattresses but also for the products of health, as the cushions for the feet that alleviate the venous system and legs.
The Czech manufacturers use for example EucathermC foam or Twinsaver or the same kind.
The equipment to follow people demanded more and more by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear for their child's leads people increasingly to think of supervising them through a GPS.
The system, setup initially to search cars can just as easily be used to trace the movement of people and help in some cases as by exmple that small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is as big as it limps of matches but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of small Anicka moved a large number of people and they began seeking ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their private life.
"We try to tell everyone that he is not of espionage but only about another way to decrease the likelihood that there is another tragedy," declares Petr Pilin of the MAcro Weil is one of the suppliers of equipment in tracing the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of bad use of such equipment, for example, to put it in the bag of a person who is not present, but I did not encounter such cases yet."
"The majority of people are customers who buy really the product for security reasons, Pilin adds.
According to her children should always know which end is used "limps" and how to use it in an emergency.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, draws attention that if the child does not want to wear on him something of this sort, it will be débarassera.
'And even smaller can show a great creativity when it comes to purposely get rid of something when they do not want to be under control."
"Mobile phones, which can be cut as the equipment of tracing, has provided parents to long waits," Bockova says.
According to him, the fact that this kind of apparatus can help in the event of aggression is highly questionable.
"If it is about a planned abduction, the author will do everything so that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate it."
"Now, it is the phone."
"As soon as will develop tracing equipment, they (criminal) will also seek them because the sale will be supported by an advertizing campaign."
"In such cases criminals will always be advances of it on the police," said the psychologist.
She acknowledges all the same equipment that can help in an assault not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the RC Surveillance society, which offers services in tracing for both cars and people, says to have this kind of apparatus can help, even though it was destroyed in the case of aggression.
"The apparatus can be parameterized in such a way that it is in regular issuance after a given period."
"If the apparatus is destroyed, there is all the same the final position of the person concerned."
'The more expensive equipment also have an inclinometer which immediately says the person who slipped and finds herself in reclining position without moving," Cech indicates.
According to the phones known as smart, which are equipped with a navigation system can offer a similar service after formatted it with a special prologiciel.
The current systems of tracing is that it acts is an apparatus similar to those that carries into pendentive the size of a limps of games is more small telephone equipment.
You can still lose them.
According to Pilina of the Macro Weil, this is why tests are being conducted to equipment that resemble common digital watches.
"It will have the advantage that the aggressor will not be able to recognize the apparatus of tracing."
"Or it will realize there after some time, which would have given the police a little more time," he adds.
The apparatus of tracing is developed in the form of bracelet or pendentive, it will always utilisiera same technology to trace cars.
It is a combination of systems acquisition of a position through GPS (which is typically used in autonavigation) and a function of a cell phone that alerts the current location of a vehicle.
The army has both detonator fuses as the tower of the Czech Republic with. But it can hold only two years.
The army bought 445 kilometers of chalk lines used for explosives.
Already last year the Defense Ministry had bought 224 kilometers.
The army has about 225 years.
The problem is that the lifetime of the chalk lines is from two to four years minimum.
The army bought detonator fuses at a limited company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The general staff gave as reason for achât a huge amount of detonator fuses to MF DNES that the soldiers use 60 kilometers per year.
According to calculations reluctance to be held by the pyrotechnists of the army, MF DNES contacted, reveals that even the generals, officers with a command, secretaries and staffs of household should have each year an exercise with explosives.
Alexander Vondra, defense Minister and Vlastimil Picek army commander, no exception.
But to argue the yearly consumption of the army's 60 kilometers detonator fuses.
At this distance fits 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the reserve army could provide for him for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true for basic training every new business it is enough to more than 2 m of detonator fuses, experts say, that means that the army with its new purchase secured - with the consumption of special units and genius - about 225 years mentioned.
But soldiers in the brigade of rapid intervention recently complained to the Vondra Minister whom they almost do not have the ammunition for handguns and that the meetings shooting are limited because of the need for money.
In connection with the lack of body linen you do not talk about it.
"And I am not caught the head if they on our premises buy such a large quantity of detonator fuses."
"And it is their decision and they really know what they are doing."
"for us the army is a good customer that we strive as traders to meet," said the sales director of STV Group Decky Jan.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the defense Ministry, argues achât one of hundreds of kilometers of detonator fuses by the fact that the army will have these "ammunition" some reserves for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group makes state but only four years of life of the detonator fuses and pyrotechnists of the police and army in just two years.
"If they are stored perfectly in deposits, it can even go up to four years," said a couple who does not want his name is published in the criticism of the army.
The lifetime spent every ammunition must be tested to see whether it is fair and life does not threaten the soldier.
These tests are not free and still cost money.
Another argument department is cut due to the quantity of 445 kilometers of cordeux explosives.
"It cost us 60 less than the supply last year of 245 kilometers," indicates the Pejsek speaker who is the interpreter of opinion buyers of the defense ministry.
Just compare. the yearly consumption of the detonator fuses the pyrotechnists police who neutralize the ammunition of World War ii, or those after the Soviet army does not exceed 1500 meters.
And organizes it always order the necessary amount of ammunition used to be before the end of their life.
It was established for security reasons of pyrotechnists and also be able to obtain more flexible path of types of more modern and more reliable detonator fuses.
the defense ministry has now big problem for neutralization tens of tons of ammunition from time from the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovakian strong army and two hundred thousand men prepared to move, course on the Rhine.
What is expected in a few years the Czech army that MF DNES contacted. neutralizing hundreds of miles of old detonator fuses that it buys now "cheap."
So today I enjoy contacts that I got through contests.
The sale under franchise from his hotel helped well Lukas Pytloun for the place winner of the contest for best individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of the contest for best individual Entrepreneur for last year was Lukas Pytloun, entrepreneur 28 year old.
His adventure to success as a film.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that Libérec he missed a website lodging quality at a reasonable price.
Its economies on what he had won when he worked abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small demolished to build 5 apartments in half.
Knowing that it was still a student in trosième year of higher learning, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between quality and price of lodging in our region gave me a desire to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He began to praise the first apartment rebuilt with foreign workers.
It reinvests the benefits in construction which he turned into retirement with 54 beds.
Since that time, his action entrepreneur allowed him to open in Libérec 4 pensions, two restaurants of style and two hotels with a full capacity of nearly 300 beds in all categories of lodging.
Most comfortable of them was recently the four stars Pytloun design hotel.
This year he himself came from there another of similar quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel with Ostrova U Stokes where we sold our concept of frankness and other candidates with the franchise from Pytloun hotels have," number 1 contractors last year.
"And for the sale of licenses for the start of a hotel on a large scale victory in the contest for the entrepreneur of the year was useful, adds Pytloun with recognition.
The victory brought more popularity and to be known for Libérec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very pleasant," he recalls.
It recommends participation in the contest to all those who try to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any chance of being visible is good.
He says that he uses to date his contacts and knowledge that he could not have got in another way.
"With those I met through the contest I began to maintain relations regularly.
According to him, the fame of success was also an impact on employees.
And he has about 70 of them.
"I was at home watching especially loyalty and pride to be himself engaged in something that was generally acknowledged."
"It is not, by far, the only result of my own work, but the result of good work for us all together.
"Only my name is forward thorough," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I want my successor a better year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory rpidement was rpidement replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the leadership of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind you.
That came to the price of Slovansky dum for first place in the contest for the Firm of the year by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the Farmet society.
The jury rewarded the effort with which he transformed a workshop of tools with Ceska Skalice into a firm with turnover of 100 million crowns.
'I can say that reward encouraged not only me my also my collaborators and increased our self-confidence to fight competition," the winner of the contest last year declares today.
At the beginning of the Farmet society there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of goods by the Communists, he did not hesitate for a long time, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a society with some comrades in the entourage of his father for the manufacturing of plastic bath-tubs.
Not very long after they began to specialize in the presses for vegetable oil.
It became after eighteen years the largest manufacturer of automated presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in public not specialized after the success achieved with the contest through the media.
"Not only our customers have started to really better knowing the Farmet mark but also foreign partners who began to realize that they collaborated with a company that got greatest success in its country of origin," said Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year, E did not happen to Farmet only ldans euphoria of victory.
Assessing the company had been made from economic performance for 2008 and part of 2009.
And precisely in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of machine engineering.
On top of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, businesses were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their achâts new materials and technology.
"We do not have conspicuously escaped this."
"The turnover fell from 40, and we had to limit our production and even fire," explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable company must know that from time to time should be unpopular measures.
But they handled the situation well and preserved bénéficiares results even if they were lower than they had before the crisis.
But in Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We built with endowments a training center and research, reinforced the presentation of the company room-exposures living and won the biggest rewards in the national exposures," said Zdarsky.
All leaves us believe that the crisis is behind them.
The figures affires rise, with the number of employees as well.
"With the new winner I want this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation, which removes crazy regulations.
The investigation into the Absurdity of the year for the fourth time part of the clan of business.
Some absurd rules could be removed.
The victorious glorious little of this year the investigation into the Absurdity of the year was forced to bring in the offices of the documents that officials can get on-line.
More than one-third of the 4000 voters voted for that.
For example, the administrations of social affairs demanded an extract paper trade register as civil servants can get it in two clicks of a mouse.
that change with the investigation.
"The Czech administration Social Security will not require any more extract trade controls register for payment of insurance," said Jana Buranova, spokesman for the Czech Administration of Social Security (CSSZ).
To emphasize the regulations and decrees that businesses and entrepreneurs must fill in the Czech Republic and remove those who are absurd is the meaning of this contest of the Absurdity of the year.
The investigation is still this year for the fourth time part of the clan, organized by Hospodarske noviny and still has a greater popularity.
If last year's 3000 voters seemed, at least 4000 this year who brought their voice.
And it is not surprising there are in our country the most diverse legal requirements that merely slow the company, and that, more and more.
"We are perhaps the documents to be filled for the tax statements in the first places in the world," declares Karel Havlicek of the Association of small and medium-sized businesses and entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying activity entrepreneur becomes a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison to the world the situation in the Czech Republic does not improve at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is located at 74 ème place about the conditions for the company, which is 8 places besides compared to last year.
The contest for the Absurdity of the year was implemented for the first time in 2006 and continue every year, according to the same scenario.
Anyone who can make state each year from administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April at the end of September, final deadline before the contest closure.
In return, there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Second, the organizer of the contest chose seven candidates for "antiprix" and let the public vote for October on www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that received more a large number of voices is declared the winner.
Until the last survey last year, it is a hundred or more precisely 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their meaning of existence.
The remarks are sent by entrepreneurs but also the professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" contest, so among the nominated, say the requirement is that fleet of maintaining highways and rapid tracks pay tolls, although entrepreneurs with two employees, repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is posted on the website of the contest.
The proclamation of the contest, which begins with at the beginning of November on the square in Prague, is part of a happening in which participating regularly of personalities in politics and public.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for small and medium-sized companies Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber Of Commerce of the Czech Republic, the culminating moment of the contest.
'Economic prosperity can work when the State put âtons in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my goal is to remove every year, at least three dozens of paragraphs that do nothing but complicate society," said Martin Kocourek, trade and Industry Minister.
The effort to remove absurd fiat is not a coup for sword in water.
In 2007, people did not like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days before at the office for private industry at the place where the company intended to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage to stand.
That requirement was removed with the amendment Law Firm private industry.
The second - most voted by plebiscite requirement in 2007, which was to declare at the Office of a work trip service for a foreign employee over 30 days, was abducted with legal text on so-called green card.
And everything is ok until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the decree for the physiotherapeutists to have a large mirror in cabinet, a refrigerator and two patent weighing machines.
That was changed by prescription of the ministry of health this year last-the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards firms socially responsible.
Are assessed environmental, humanitarian, training or sports projects.
Innovation of the year contest in Hospodarske Noviny, which already has existed for 5 years, is the category called the Firm Responsible for the year 2010.
The onjectif one of the contest is supporting the sensible and right.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impacts of their society on the environment and to undertake a socially responsible activities," Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of the operator of cell phone indicates, Vodaphone firm, which is guaranteeing and promoter of this contest, as in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For the first year of this subcategory of the contest for the firm of the year 2010, organized by Vodaphone firm, companies were enrolled who do not have success with a long-term target for the company.
The adventure each of them is rich inspirations and an independent article would be to publish.
Although the object of their society is different one from the other one can see their activity and forecast as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, that is the disabled and personal problems or health of their employees.
Fourteen among the finalists for the Czech Republic is not the company prologiciels pragoise And Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams their employees who participate in so many tournaments in various sports disciplines.
Another example of firm responsible for the region of Pardubice the company Isolit-Cheer has been for 17 years the main contributor to fund equipment which sponsors disabled children.
Well aware of dealing with employees with health problems, you can still include former manufacturing plant of paper of Podebrad that some employs more than 70 and, for that, won the title of Responsable firm for the region in central Bohemia and placed third in the region to contest the Firm of the year by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a finance company, which won to have introduced more flexible working hours and decreased to 35 hours per week on average, and this without, proportionally, cutting salaries.
The jury to déverné the title because it achête priority with the Czech companies, supports a ditoyenne activity in close entourage and is concerned about environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our activity of society and our administration have less environmental impact," explains Miluse Ryznarova, executive director of the society.
THE company responsible Enlogit for the Region of Usti also thinks of the health of its employees and their setup for each laptop a chair and an ergonomic keyboard, encourages their home-based business and uses the catering services of a local factory protected for his actions.
"We support from the foundation man in the shadows that helps Rom the local community," said Ondrej Suchy representative of society.
The latest spat is also for its activities, a firm of Washing and cleaning of the Karlovy Vary, who takes part in the pension insurance for his employees in the form of bonuses above standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, higher education and leisure," said Joseph Strapac of the company building bruntal Czasch, winner of the Moravia-Silesia.
Backstop automatically registered voters in the category company Responsable, all regional finalists for the contest by the Firm of the year by Vodaphone, who had answered questionnaires in the attachment of the document for the inscription and returned it to the organizer before August 15th.
The answers wrong or incomplete filled in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the contest by organizer.
"If the representatives of the companies candidates had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the contest for Responsable firm but were not disqualified "primary" contest the Firm of the year by Vodaphone."
"The independent inscriptions are not possible because it is a subcategory of the main contest the Firm of the year," explains Karel Goldman of organizing agency Bison&Rose.
The Money for the Land in Plzen, police made arrests for public contest
In construction of the Money for the Land in Plzen, the anti-corruption police made arrests in recent days.
The detectives passed the shackles to local entrepreneur and trading in Lubos housing. G.
It was precisely to handle a public invitation to tender for the regulation of demand for restitution in such a way that the proposed is achieved by a determined candidate.
It was paying in Lubos G. half - a - million crowns.
"For the moment I can confirm that police continues a person for offense to initiate a public invitation to tender and concour." for the Pravo newspaper the head of the Parquet Floor of Plzen Antonie Zelena said, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is underway.
Police officers gave 12 after midnight the 46 year old entrepreneur in freedom.
How it might influence a public contest, one can only speculate in view of so little official information.
With a question of Pravo, the speaker of the land Lubomira Cerna said that the police had really made an arrest in Plzen on a separate workplace, and this during the contest.
"It was a customer and in no way an employee, she specified.
The contest for Cerna is as true name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land under the Law on the ground" and setup when several candidates have seem right.
"These people offer, as part of the plea, a higher value of their rights to resitutions that must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to rights, suggested a ranking of buyers is implemented and the land transfer the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," explained the speaker of the Funds.
Lubos G. had, it is clear information about people who had been registered with the call as it is, also, a person bénéficiare as having bought a large number of rights to restitutions, it had offered candidates for the land not to participate in the contest.
And it probably boxed by the fact of withdrawing himself.
What would explain why he had such an amount of money in his possession at the time of its interpellation.
Lubos G. had contacts largely above standards in FdT Fund (land).
It appeared in the case of the ex-chief of FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for criminal to have to publish land for which it had already published the establishment of a construction.
Precisely Lubos G. had obtained for example land for the construction of public communications, concretely in place and where was to be built the artery of access to the industrial park Borske Pole.
It later traded to the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far higher.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it was likely to put construction in danger by blocking of the land.
Households will pay a monthly supplement a hundred crowns for housing.
Households will have starting from January to pay a supplement not just for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, supplies heating and in some places rents will rise.
Families will have to draw so starting from January from their wallets to a hundred crowns monthly more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, the gas nearly 2 percent more expensive in some localities you will have to pay until a tenth in the provision of water and in many places the supply of central heating will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity should annually border for households in apartment 100 crowns more than currently.
But all the suppliers reduced the price of electricity given the significant development to encourage the production of renewable energies, including photovoltaic piles.
The gas is increasing moderately but of course when people need it most to heat and have greater consumption.
You can also count hundreds more crowns.
Although electricity and gas in the Czech republic, the price of central heating differs from city to city.
In fact, mainly the biggest commune plan price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay starting from January for central heating nearly 50 crowns in a month, the families of Libérec will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the people of Prague an increase of 9 percent for water and sanitation for the case is where the city is rising rents of infrastructure.
If rents do not change the pragois will pay a supplement of 6.8.
The price in Prague will form part of low in comparison to the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices already form part of the highest, water and sanitation rise by 7.4.
Prices for rents will rise for example, markedly in the 450 thousand apartments in hiring starting from January. at the end of regulation.
For example, the company Byty icc has in Usti nad Labem nearly 2500 apartments, ordered an increase to 100.
Those who can not deal with the increase in rents will be brought before the courts by the company.
Controlled rents that people in nearly 300 thousand apartments pay could increase next year by 10 percent.
The Czech children saoûlent themselves with rum and fernet. The beer is no longer regime and acts all slowly.
The fernet, rum, vodka and an exceptional way the best whisky brand are stolen to parents.
They are drinks that bring generally those who saoûlent, which is not yet fifteen years old, in the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at the hospital for repeat do not the exception.
That results from the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions of children services in hospitals.
"Beers and wines are no longer regime because it takes time to be drunk."
'The trend is really high alcohols," denotes for Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Chef department of the hospital in Horovice in central Bohemia.
"When they succeed in bating a dad bottle in the cupboard, it is sometimes wisky but it is the fernet and vodka that prévalent'.
"Vodka has the advantage that they can mix it with the result juice and thus not feel it," explains the Head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman for the Motol hospital, also gives him reason.
"In general, it is a rum or fernet."
"It is alcohol fashionable particularly in primary schools."
"In some cases, it was about slivovice they brought from home," Jurinova added.
According to the Head of Pélikan department, to see old drunk children from thirteen to fourteen years with admissions at the hospital is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was Motol precisely where he exercised a decade in pediatry where ambulances brought schoolchildren of the broad totally drunk surroundings.
"The girl was hospitalized four times
"It acommencé his career at twelve years when he was brought to 3.5 per thousand in blood alcohol in with a mixture with extasy," the doctor this particularly important case described.
"It was the Exhibition Site of Holesovice to a party."
"What is interesting is that it did not seem odd to the mother that her daughter was missing 48 hours," said Director surprised by the Department.
It is satisfying parents or tolerance in common with the fact that their kids devote themselves to drink which are the root cause of the development of alcoholism of children.
According to experts, does not speak but about addiction, his strict sense for the children.
"The alcoholic word you hear chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the events which result from this that you do not find in children."
"Those who use the acool with repetition, it is a socio-family background significantly adverse," explained lead Pélikan Department.
According to the Jurinova spokesman, about drunk four children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the clinic pediatry in Motol.
Are integrated into stastistic only cases with a grâve intoxication requiring hospitalization.
The drunk children who are after emergency treatment brought back home by parents or the police are not included.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, he exsite according to Pélikan three seasonal waves that can be taken into account. the day of the witches, saint Sylvestre and school end of the year.
"Either they drink by even after bad results or on the contrary, they celebrate the holiday."
"Of course I lived the day of the witches an admission of 7 drunk children at once," Pélikan noted.
The drunken child who spent the night in hospital in desintoxciation under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than returned home and suffers the following day from "the hangover."
The headaches of the morning caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion from glucose and nutrients the body needs.
"This is better off as they pass an excellent evening then a soft awakening and nothing hurts them."
"They are surprised by where they are," Pélikan knowing adds that from time to time that wastes the right mood of patients at least the bill to be paid for their care.
Transport by ambulance and hospitalization in bed intensive care can go until tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I applied that as a means of education including these children how much their intoxication and cost than they could spend all summer seasonal work to pay one evening," Pélikan added.
However, according to him, insurance companies, healthcare in their managements in regression, which should recover on the part of parents charges related to healthcare, do not treat the cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 planes are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two planes L-159 five in all, against whom the Defense Ministry traded transport planes Casa C-295M, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the seat manufacturer Put-EADS planes.
It is the first time that equipment of this type become the property of someone else that the Czech army.
Yet they were abroad within the framework of exercises or demonstration flights.
It is the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that was until now in service in the Czech army and was in a state of vol.
Lestrois remaining equipment are single-seat versions of L-159.
Those job for now at Aéro Vodochody and trade broker - Omnipol firm - took into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek department press department of defense, physical leaving the aircraft Vodochody for the unknown.
'Airplanes L-159 single-seaters planned for the exchange was caught on aircraft stored for long without causing additional charges or investments for the defense Ministry."
"The two-seaters L-159 T1 were exchanged in the state," said for Pravo Pejsek.
It has tournament that the army will remain without two-seater since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unutilised L-159 single-seaters in the two-seaters.
The army took delivery of the first apparatus in July, the second being planned for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS committed to introducing the planes into the equipment parts of the Alliance.
"The contract is clearly indicated that the L-159 planes into account is EADS and that they will be used for pilot training members of NATO."
"It is therefore the case that takes into account in determining how to achieve that," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago, the Spanish army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a plane and Put the purchase of three other planes for 3.5 billion crowns was signed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The defense ministry did not launch an invitation to tender and EADS contacted directly.
the defense argued while the ensures a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought in Aéro Vodochody 72 equipment and does not use any 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes will probably have legal implications.
the European Commission has carried felt sorry for the Czech ministry of defense to the European Court Of Justice because the planes should have been selected as an invitation to tender on a European scale and in any case by contacting the manufacturer directly.
The army already taken delivery of three planes Casa, the last to arrive at the airport in Prague Kbely in two weeks.
An index longer than the annular it is a small sign of cancer risk
The men who have the index longer than the annular you are exposed to less risk for cancer of the prostate.
It is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British journal Cancer.
That may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the length of the finger is used as a simple test risk of cancer of the prostate, especially for men to 60 years," the joint author of the study Ros Eeles proclaimed, a professor at the Institute for research on cancer at the university of Warwick.
Finger could help determine that men should subject themselves to test for cancer of the prostate, especially by combining with the genetic risk or other factors aggrâvants as family health record, Eeles added.
For the period of 1994-2009 he followed with his colleagues to the uk more than 1500 patients with cancer of the prostate and at the same time, nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants under investigation had the index of hand shorter than the annular.
For them, as for the 19 of those who had fingers the same length, it found the same likelihood of cancer of the prostate.
In the case of those who had the index longer than annular risk but fell to 33 for men and 60 years the reduction in risk reached 87.
The length of the two cited fingers - formed for antenatal period - is notably different levels of sex hormones that the child in the uterus is exposed.
With less testosterone fits a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely the testosterone that development aid of a cancer of the prostate.
Professor Vacla Paces, famous Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy Of Science, for CTK said that it is in the current study but it does not seem to him, it seems that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer "is fully charged."

As he said Wednesday the giant specialized in manufacturing and maintenance computers, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far on the Marienbader place in the town of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, vast complex of offices located on the streets Lyoner Straße of the Niederrad District in Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesman explained that in the medium - term, the group should gather 100 other jobs still sparse so far in the region.
The supply of hiring was extremely attractive. In addition, the offices to open surface of Astro Park are appropriate for better working method of collaborators.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was right tenant.
The managing director, Bernd Wagner, said. "Frankfurt-Niederrad for us is an important site with a remarkable infrastructure."
He says that connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The abduction of a large company within the region caused the joy of winners yesterday and caused the disappointment of losers.
The person in charge of economic affairs of the city of Frankfurt, mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that again, "global player" had been thus conquered.
It is an "extraordinary relative profession of faith instead of establishment."
Fujitsu is appropriate for the city and its establishment is an important momentum for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, mr. Michael Korwisi (greens), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The very early warned the city of this.
"It goes without saying that we offered our assistance to the company," Mr Korwisi said.
However, the friendly relations could not have changed anything with the difficulties of computer maker against the owner of the building of the Marienbader Place.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is a question now of preventing that such a unique place does not remain unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and lender construction will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the construction of the city Hall, used so far by the firm Fujitsu and "small neighboring vertical," as well as the rest of the buildings of the Marienbad, belonged to the controversial construction project in spa.
Result of a joint project of the city and a private developer of projects, a new entrance of the city was created between the station and the Town Hall. It caused many critics, not only because of the impressive implementation of surfaces that were once used partly as a carpark, but also because of the tune of buildings.
In 2001, the company rating and advice in investment, Feri, the computer maker for the delivery systems of travel, Are Amadeus, such as Fujitsu, computer maker at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into buildings.
In 2006, the German group of specialized Frankfurt Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the real estate Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings were resold at the Spanish firm Falcon Real Estate Investment SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group, whose headquarters is in Tokyo as the third largest provider of software products in the world.
For example, it puts computers and waiters available to companies and also ensures the service.
Its branch in the region of Rhine-Hand is one of the most important in Germany. Fujitsu is probably more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, go Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. Other subsidiaries in this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
This 7000 square foot took in hiring in construction Astro Park.
The former two years complex, whose name reminds its draft drawing star, among other houses the headquarters of the Confederation of electronics industry and electrotechnical.
The expulsion of the waiter by Amazon --Threats against mr. Assange
Wikileaks has difficulties and more.
Internet service providers Amazon expelled from his waiters the specialized website in the revelation of confidential documents.
Perhaps this attitude obscures political pressures after the publications of the hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, mr. Assange, is apparently in England.
In the us, the Wikileaks site is attacked with more force.
The cyber-activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to his waiter lodged so far in America and seeks now shelterer in Europe.
Meanwhile, the leading us Senator, Joe Lieberman, called other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, probably remain in Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon waiter."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom" (standard time) the cyber-activists said Wednesday at the revelations through the Twitter social network.
Shortly before, cyber-company, Amazon had removed the Wikileaks documents from his waiters.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, the cyber-activists resorted to the Office Web of Amazon (AWS) in order to be able to reach more a large number of access to the documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations. "Formidable, our dollars are now spent to deal with people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem with Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The CNN television, citing the office of mr. Liebermann, reported that Amazon Wikileaks banned from using its waiters after the poll conducted by collaborators senator Joe Lieberman.
The president of the commission of the Senate for the protection of the territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott in his opposition, reported the British newspaper "The Guardian."
"I would have wanted Amazon takes the measure earlier view previous publications by Wikileaks with classified information as" said the senator.
At the same time, mr. Liebermann urged other countries to refuse the use of waiters by the platform.
"Wikileaks acts in an illegal, monstrous and without scruples. By doing so, he put national security at risk and danger life everywhere around the world," according to an independent communiqué senators.
"No company aware of his responsibilities, it is American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to diffuse the contents of the stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, mr. Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, figure on the list of people wanted by Interpol.
According to the information disseminated by the London newspaper "Independent," the 39 year old Australian living in the United Kingdom and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist constantly called intrigue orchestrated by his detractors legal action in his opposition by Sweden.
A spokesman for Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that threats were uttered on the site.
"Calls have even launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange fears particularly for its security, said Hrafnsson.
It is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly responded to statements made in North America.
In America, the former republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that officials of the disclosures by Wikileaks be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, an adviser to the Head Of Government, mr. stephen Harper said on television, obviously in an ironic way, mr. Assange should "be killed" and that mr. Obama could "use a Drone."
Meanwhile, the controversy began between the White House and mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for the US president, Barack Obama, called "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that mr. assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if it were responsible for the order to diplomats, and revealed recently, to devote himself to espionage activities.
"I do not know exactly why we must deal with the views of individual owner of the website," mr. Gibbs declares.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website."
The US government completely is now testing established the protection of its databases.
According to an official statement from the White House, mr. Russell Through, deputy editor of the Center of the anti-terror fight, were named responsible to fight leaks.
Mr. Through is charged to implement "structural reforms" were needed after disclosures of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the administration and protects the information.
Moreover, the US government announced that he wanted to address the safety of dissidents and activists if ever, those were threatened by the revelations of Wikileaks.
"We have been implemented to come into contact with them," said the spokesman for the State Department, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if it proves necessary."
The university of Ice
At the "Gelato university of Bologna, one prepares the confectioners ice at the best seasons of the year.
The introductory course three days organized for the future glaciers had a great success and attracted visitors come from everyone.
As does the fact, coming all the ice?
Glacier and machine with ice.
The glacier, in German the confectioner ice become somewhat old-fashioned, manufactures the cream according to the rules of the Italian art manufacturing of ice.
The turbine with ice cream removes the ice of the window cooled using a spatula, lays out in waffle and then begins to sell it.
For knowledge, you do not need to go to Anzola dell' Emilia in Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice can avoid "Gelato-University" the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of the ice-cream freezers founded the university of ice in 2003 for the ice creams left its machines respond to the high ideals Italian everywhere.
The introductory course three days organized for the future glaciers had a great success and attracted visitors from around the world.
Also offered special price of chocolate ice and extending over several days. Similarly, practical meetings are held in private mirror factory.
In a midlife crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply go so far as to execute their burning desire to smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants from 19 countries in all continents, Brazil, Saudi Arabia via Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of education artistic come from California is set on the Slow Food movement. He wants in the future to offer a European product quality to the country's industrial Ice.
Anke Berlin east adviser in business management and it wants, after a few years, to draw some peculiar thing from this trade test of nerves.
Two young Egyptian Women dream to open a mirror factory in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian cleaning lady came because his children love the Italian ice creams.
The glacier Luciano Ferrari initially explains participants ideal of the perfect ice.
Is crucial not only good savour, but also the silky flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during training icing on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, the south. "The Italian ice is simply the best. and then it still retains a sacred amount of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing is quite simple.
Luciano pays basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, dried milk, sugar and stabilizers in a mixer, which heats all 85 degrees grace an electronic program, then cools immediately with four degrees.
It opens a tap installed on the machine. it leaves a pasteurized basic white, cream of all kinds of ice to milk.
The coach is assailed overnight in question. Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can you give free course for personal enjoyment of the experiment?
Mr. Luciano warns against the fact of letting itself induce in error by the spirit of time.
That speaks about ice "made from natural ingredients," despite that use of automatic. usually a natural product, for example the flour seed of guar obtained from bean of guar.
Of course, it is possible to make ice without using stabilizer, it should be sold within a period of 12 midnight, otherwise it collapses and customer will anything crunch only granules of ice.
Some changes in the basic mass are allowed.
That becomes more exciting with the flavours.
The Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that acquires in ray fruits or confectioneries the supermarket.
Moreover, there is powder and pastes.
"suppliers will try to give you dozen aromatized ingredients."
"However, you should simply try."
Maybe the recipes of sorbets to the fruits with fresh sugar and fruit.
Maybe in ice creams made from basic white mass, while adding egg becomes a yellow cream and it is, when one adds cocoa powder to it, the foundation of all the desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course must move to use machines to ice.
Luciano from time to time invites them to make four kinds of ice. with vanilla, chocolate mocha, coffee and hazel nut with or without eggs in basic mass, more or less flavour of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
Various kinds of ice in the fruit are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic products, and result mashed potatoes. from the perspective of taste, it is not absolutely better.
The ice with hazel nuts does not include the taste of nut, when it consists mainly of hazel nuts.
The ice with kiwi, popular, is manufactured from the group using more fruits, water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mix properly raises the taste of ice," Luciano says.
The manufacturing of ice is an exercise of calculation. if one uses mashed potatoes fishing with many sugar, the amount of sugar is reduced to the basic recipe.
A supplement sugar is needed for ice and lemon.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which it determines the sugar content of different types of fruit (vine growers use to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make calculations.
The manufacturing of ice does not require any more, as once, as many physical intervention.
It is not only the automated manufacturing machine tool basic mass that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which one beats simultaneously combination of ice available to return to consistent and brought to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, light breakdowns are not excluded.
Brazilian Gustavo smears result mashed potatoes of the head to feet and, thus, splashes his fellow students when control of the colossal mixing bowl leaks.
The Master Luciano believes that "a similar incident is likely to happen in each course. it is only a matter of time."
Supervisors in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry testing culture of gm plants cored the European Food Safety Authority.
The charge is now formulated by the Testbiotech panel, which is regarded as an independent institute for evaluating the consequences of biotechnology.
"That sounds like a theory of conspiracy, but we know well," declared Wednesday in Munich mr. Christoph Then, Directeur of Testbiotech.
Some information gives a report on what the Efsa panel for gm plants, Mr Harry Kuiper, as other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi lobby.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé and Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper collaborated in a crucial in the development of regulations test of Efsa for gm plants and is so clearly in a conflict situation, according to critics formulated by mr. Then.
The elaborate textually meet regulations, subparagraphs, the stance of the Ilsi lobby and therefore carry the mark of the industry, basically, would be controlled by the authorities installed in Parma in Italy.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A cio senior of Efsa recently joined without condition or transitional period agroalimentary the Swiss Syngenta group. By doing so, He changed sides
Not long ago, even Radio in Central Germany (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the authority of the European Union in charge of control and industrial lobby, which awakened the suspicions and German Federal Agency for the environment and the European parliament.
However, Efsa does not recognize the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion is that it exploits the reliable data, including industry as long as they are professional good quality.
One does not prohibit the experts working on behalf of Efsa to engage contacts with this branch of industry.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the international institute for life sciences (Global Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
The organization considers himself as a neutral forum gathering experts who are, among other things, to the field of science, industry and politics in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the pay of the lobby.
In this case, independent experts such that mr. Then disapprove the fact that gm plants are accepted without any test food animals and did not test the impact of these plants on the environment.
"We want to know, for example, the consequences of genetically modified maize causes for the area" says mr. Then.
Current practice is testing only isolated proteins and not all seedling gm, which does not allow to get reliable results.
"If the risks are not sought, how can you then discover them?" ask mr. Then an accusers tone.
It is also the view of Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
The scientist leads research since 1994 in the field of genetics and now works at the polytechnic school of Zurich.
In this region as in the us, and now also in Europe, the industry is more to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are not even researchers who are not related to businesses.
In the view of society, critical studies would not be released.
Mrs Hilbeck says that "industry controls research on security."
Stone trace
Uli Gsell got some of the roughly 400 kilo.
Monday afternoon, it was the job of Stuttgart, with its tube at the back.
There was demo.
It snowed.
History is known. In September, general purpose excavators and began suddenly had demolished most of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart was no longer the same. Several thousand people protested against the project S21, the transformation of the central station of Stuttgart into an underground station that will cost several billion.
Most of the wing was in ruins when the demonstration led to the stoppage of works construction.
Broken into 6000.7000 pieces.
Falun Muschelkalk (limestone) Crailsheim, a tender paving stone and crude evil builds between 1914 and 1920.
Mr Gsell is a 43 year old sculptor residing at Ostfildern.
He got some fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They should not disappear."
He declares with enthusiasm. "a rock small and cheap, simple and ground."
He saying that by cutting out it was, he felt the odor of cigarette smoke.
He does not know yet what will this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
the footsteps of the stones of Stuttgart lead to an old ammunition dump in the French Army in a forest located near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built its empire stone.
The 44 year old man is the old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition to Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappear in the discharge" declares in his office located in a hut, which was once a guardroom.
He said that he was subjected to insults and threats in September when newspapers reported that he had buys the rest of the northern wing of the demolition contractor.
But he negotiated over the whole days with opponents of S21 project.
And he told them why he could do nothing all oppose demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most sensible thing would be to continue to use stones.
About 200 opponents of S21 project carried a stone parallelepiped later weighing on average 80 kilos whose value lies between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keeps it in remembering while also hoping to be able to return it for a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 loadings complete a truck.
About half are still crammed into the forest, the rest being long sold.
Owners of gardens, landscape gardener, Private Individuals.
They came from everywhere and that this could enter the trunk and trailers.
These stones of scandal of Stuttgart turned long into "Mäuerle" or limitations of the grass plat bands.
"In fact, the stone is nothing particularly" says Mr Rongen.
"have-be this political element."
It enters its cross-country car, is the turn of its vast empire of 20 hectares.
He studies law that he abandoned. Later, he has undertaken to study biology before later being interested in computers and eventually become a carrier.
And a stone amateur.
It stores 40000 tons.
It piles up treasures in Germany everywhere.
HE says that he is the greatest merchant of old stones.
It is held back.
Sand stones carved with art are laid on snow.
"Once They belonged to the bridge Marienbrücke to Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, heat, he says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
It is the way that goes up through the forest.
It shows a heap of finger. Red sand Peter, before left the post of Karlsruhe.
And so on.
"Pretty travertine."
The parallelepiped were once part of the platform Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Around the snow of the stones and the stories, travertine of Cannstatt from the police headquarters, the reddish granite from the cathedral Blasien st., tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What a work, What A efforts, what a sweat!
When mr. Rongen believes that once the stones were carved by hand and have moved using simple hoists and carts drawn by beef animals, it becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such an inheritance was put in."
He did not become rich, much less ultra-rich.
But the carrier employs 14 people. Moreover, stonecutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass-blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it is gratifying," recyclor of waste says.
Soon, he must go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Battle of talent to win high potential
The counter knows a sharp multitude.
16 students hustle themselves to buy rolls, salmon with tomato sauce and white-mangers.
The technical university in Braunschweig and Volkswagen car manufacturer invited students to design and mechanical engineering with a workshop.
In a contest of ideas, they must speak to about the car of the future with designers of VW, in hindsight, to know the Volkswagen firm.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body to body in the competition to unearth better brains and to begin, like Volkswagen, multiform cooperation with universities.
Their mission. To recruit the most talented graduates as far as possible in amphitheatres before they arrive on the labor market and that they are not courted by others.
Since universities do not publish statements regarding the performance of their students, trying to locate the exceptional talent within the practical projects and fidéliser.
During the second day of the workshop held at the technical university of Brauschweig auto group persuades talent.
A young lady of service personnel divides the pens, candies and maps comprising the logo of Volkswagen.
She talks about the timing of professional training courses and student jobs to young talent. it shows the ways for them to reach the enclosure of the group.
It is Nico Selle technical university in Braunschweig, which is responsible for the project engaged with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both sides. "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, it can know the students, watching serious candidates more closely and love those who enter account as a collaborator."
According to mr. saddles, Such cooperation is unusual.
What is there, it is offensive to which seeks to attract yourself students.
"Once the focus was instead laid on the community project," Mr Selle says.
The struggle for conquest of new graduates will be much rougher.
In goods sectors, companies can recruit their collaborators longer carrying out a sorting on a string of candidates.
But they must boast of their reliability and especially court highly skilled workforce.
They are especially graduates from engineering sectors are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German VDI engineers, more than 40,000 posts of engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And according to forecasts VDI, the gap regarding the posts of engineer will increase.
Roman Dykta goes to hunt the talents on behalf of KPMG, cabinet audit, accounting and council.
He organizes expensive events aimed to the recruitment of talent, as for example the race cruising KPMG-Race, a species of rally-paper where competitors must find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year if they go this way the United States.
Participants can accidentally visit the subsidiaries of KPMG and know the company.
That must participate in it decides in advance after two procedures for selection.
Only the cream of the cream of many candidates will fly away for the United States.
According to Mr Dykta, the means used for search of high potential in the universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the batch thanks to the race cruising."
"For us, a cruising was not enough thing"
For hunter of talent that is mr. Dykta, the account appears to be there.
"Until now, we remained in liaison with all the people who took part last year with a similar action."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send to their demands to our society." say it.
Aside from direct softening in the campus, small and medium-sized companies place in a traditional way of taking part in the professional fairs where they are left to hunt for brains.
"We try to reach the graduates while attending the trade show."
"For example, in the living room of solar technologies," indicates Mrs Sitha Stübe, director of human resources at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The company installed in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs Stübe is about problems related to changing.
Currently, 35 plants are in competition based on the site of the company.
"At this moment, it is very difficult to provide for the vacant posts."
"Is This expensive and takes time," is secure?
Another way to establish the contact is passing through university professors.
Solarworld established cooperation with various higher education, educational institutions, for example, the university of Freiburg.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the option of carrying out professional training courses or on our homes to write his plans late studying."
Costly advertizing campaigns are reported in the specialists in solar.
So the company is trying to make its advertizing by highlighting other qualities. personalized environment, hierarchy punt and easy communication.
"Often, a large group can not do that," supports Mrs Stübe, staff director.
A long time ago that money does not hold any more major role in the job search.
The flexible working hours, child care or good opportunities for promotion are other key factors.
According to a study by the institute Great Places to Work, Solarworld occupies the 55e place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute is an annual honnor roll of German employers.
For this purpose, he questions the collaborators on their satisfaction degree from their work and his background while watching the condition-frameworks workers.
The personnel director Mrs Stübe hopes that institutionalization will help raise the image of society from job-seekers.
"I think the defer especially on the outside assessments with regard to a potential employer," she declares.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler German academy DEBA (Deutscher To Employ Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises to his customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to mr. Kriegler, this means, above all, to take internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to be attractive to go through his own collaborators," he says.
That is called, in the jargon used in the sector, internal strategy image, i.e the brand image of the employer within his own manpower.
"happy collaborators train the best messengers."
When his employees are treated well and that they identify with the company, they only advertizing their employer with their friends and acquaintances.
"It is as if you played in an orchestra," mr. Kriegler declares.
Obama is a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, in the southeast of the United States, for years to come.
The government of Washington pronounced a ban an equivalent ban and, thus, permanently canceled its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remain for the time being banned.
Inside secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement Wednesday.
It is the explosion, in April, the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" is at the root of the strict ban. It should remain in force for at least the next five years.
In this accident in which cost the lives of eleven employees and conduit the biggest environmental disaster in the us, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this branch of industry, had indicated that he was willing to allow the achievement of new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
Advocates of this approach are thus reduce the dependence of the United States vis-à-vis foreign countries in terms of oil.
The question of who takes responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the gulf, so far, is not permanently resolved.
The British oil group, which faces compensation demands of several billion, is at the center of the charges.
A committee of inquiry established by Obama must report in its December.
In October, the within secretary Ken Salazar had lifted a freeze of drilling declared after the explosion of the platform.
Following that decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted requests relative to new drilling projects.
With stricter control measures and tighter safety instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another catastrophe.
The competent governing authority, which was discredited after many corruption charges, is currently the subject of serious reform.
At the same time, mr. Obama announced would remove them lucrative tax loopholes of oil and gas groups.
The actors in this branch of industry publicly warn now on the fact that the fuel in the gulf would be significantly lower than it was not until now.
"The purpose of the government is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the oil and gas" according to the results of a survey conducted today in the cabinet audit BDO, before the ban on drilling pronounced Wednesday.
Moreover, Enery Alliance laments the uncertainty that characterizes this sector. "Nobody knows what exactly will change the rules."
Agreed investment in new projects of support were delayed until a new order, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni land is dry
The water runs into rivers is oiled brown. it triggers an odor similar to that which exists in petrol station. Because of an escape, billions of liters of oil destroyed the Ogoni land in Nigeria.
The men live in theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"You do not exhaust," the militant ecologist launches to journalists to calm them. "You still enough oil mud in front of duckweed."
The 37 year old Nigerian tried to picture a young inserted in muddy water to the chest, as well as roam fat that surrounds it. This scene seems almost beautiful water in the glare of the color of the rainbow.
You can not realize that the basement abounds in brown crude oil tablecloths.
On bank Bodo-Jetty river, Esther Badom said that, once it raised shrimp, with buckets around here.
But meanwhile calm water completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge quantity of oil spouted of a pipeline that exploded in the vast swamp.
The fishermen living small town near Bodo now must rank for six hours to reach full of fish out of water. The Ogoni land located in the heart of the Niger Delta is regarded as one of the regions most polluted in the world.
The extent of the devastation jumps in the eyes when it traverses the marshes of mangrove swamp crossed by rivers.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat splits water chestnut cradingue. Anyone who plunges his hand he withdraws it is covered with oil.
The roots of small emerging mangrove swamp land as sticks of liquorice. The isolated palm trees sadly we hang their palms.
One seeks clouds of birds in vain, as usually meets some in the wetlands. As soon as outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence falls back on this paradise of old like a service station by the odor that it triggers.
"What is happening here, it is war against the environment," declares mr. Celestine Akpobari a sad air. "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
Comparing the wars is made.
The region where live Ogoni is a battlefield besieged for decades. There are more than 60 years, the first European explorers penetrated here. the resistance was organised in 1980 years the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. it was carried out later. In 1993, Shell group had to stop production activities in the region because people had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, a return to the Ogoni country is banned at the company. While more than 2 million barrels of oil are daily pumped through more than 5000 wells for drilling and 7000 miles of pipelines in the region of the niger Delta, three times as large Switzerland, the oilfields of the Ogoni country are untapped, because the situation is too unstable there for the oil group.
Every few hundred meters are drawn up in the water steel trestles as odd sculptures. It is affectionately indicates "Christmas tree" the heads of boreholes.
They face up to 50 years, the majority are corroded by corrosion until the reference mark.
Akpobari estimates that a head of drilling of this nature breaks of piece from time to time, because a steady flow of oil runs in water.
According to estimates by the experts, more than two billion liters poured on the ecosystem in 50 years. Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that flowed out into the sea at the time of the accident the super-tanker "Exxon Valdez" there is 21 years off Alaska, one of the biggest environmental disaster in history.
Who has to take responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to that question divides the player.
For Shell group, sabotage and siphoning pipelines are responsible for more than 90 pourcent pollution. Environmentalists for their part, the explosions heads of drilling and pipelines perforated as the leading causes.
In 2008, the American scientist Richard Steiner blamed the Shell group for applying to Nigeria safety standards mostly less strict than elsewhere in the world. The failure rate of conduits is "still far higher than alleures."
Some emerging of the mangrove swamps in a place that, given by far, looks like a workshop abandoned, full of dirty oil and installed free air. They are completely naked and dirty oil covers the neck.
A fire scintillates under one of the many barrels that sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without reason on the site should be reference mark. a small underground refinery.
It makes heat oil in the barrel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
First, gasoline penetrates into a container through pipes, then, at the end of the control of kerosene fall down and gets finally diesel.
So Michael and his collaborators four daily produce four barrels of Diesel 300 liters. "That brings to 34,000 Naira," about 22 dollars.
The inhabitants of the Delta benefit from chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in Sub-saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a price less expensive than ridiculously low of just 40 cents of Euro per liter of Diesel. Because they acquire their raw materials free.
it is offered by "guardians" who put the network of pipelines in borer everywhere across the country of Ogoni. According to experts, the country loses this way at least 16 million liters of oil in the Niger Delta.
Only a completely trivial small portion of raw material is temporarily stored illegally purified. The networks of organised crime that also count among its members politicians and soldiers of senior officials, the lion's share of tankers and sell off on the global market.
The Akpobari militant views the carry trade debate on the question of whether it is necessary to attribute the environmental disaster or rather the subversive activities with the population or the production lax is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not seen as intruders and if the foundations of the lives of fishermen were not so profoundly destroyed, there would be neither sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
But Entre-temps, the relationship of Ogoni especially with respect to Shell deteriorated so much that it was no longer issue but the group. "perhaps operators with other nationalities, like china's, will be better."
Second, Michael becomes nervous.
"It is high time that you give up" announcement the robust worker of oil.
"Soldiers can be constantly."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will not be subject to arrest, but most will offer bribes.
The soldiers, from the north of the country intend to benefit as all Nigerians from the raw material.
"From a standpoint, this rotten trick made fall much lower our country," Akpori regrets.
The investigators find constructional flaws in the engines of A380
A380 clearly suffers from a major security problem.
By examining an apparatus that made an emergency landing, investigators found a possible flaw constructional which can lead to "catastrophic failure of the engine."
The Qantas airline wants to win now felt sorry for the manufacturer of the engine.
At the beginning of November, passengers of the Airbus pertaining to the Quantas company had clearly had far more chance. During the survey it conducted, the Australian authority in charge of air safety noted that the engines of some A380 equipment presented a serious security problem, and he warns against a possible constructional default.
That potential failure could result in serious consequences. It can cause splits of fatigue and leaks about the connection of the conduit for oil, indicates a stance that published Thursday by the administration of ATSB.
It could have led to a "catastrophic failure of the engines."
At stake are the Rolls-Royce engines manufactured and equipping 20 aircraft with the A380 series.
The Airbus of the Quantas company, which had to land on November 4th in Singapore, emergency number of those.
The Australian airline now hired legal proceedings against the british manufacturer of engines.
He lodged a legal complaint with an Australian federal court, whose headquarters is in Sydney. This approach gives him the possibility of taking further legal action against the company.
The Quantas, mr. Alan Joyce, said his company would claim damage to the incident which happened at the beginning of November.
Parts were detached and airfoil was damaged in the fire in the engine.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the ignition is causing the damage.
After that incident, at least 40 engines must now be replaced in the world.
The Australian investigators announced that other tests on security will be conducted on the superjumbos which are equipped with engines in issues.
The recommendations of security are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said the speaker ASTB, mr. Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered large enough warning all parties involved.
After the emergency landing his plane, the Quantas airline had immobilized on the ground its fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of his eleven A380.
The Lufthansa company replaced by precautionary measure, the A380 engines.
The plane on two floors is the largest airliner in the world.
The snowfall on all the territory causes chaos in transport
Covered in Germany white. In one night, snow fell on virtually every country.
Chaos reigns on the roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
The winter makes jingle Germany. By freezing temperatures, almost all the republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, the cover of snow reaches 15 centimeters in some places.
Traffic is heavily restricted on several highways and roads.
On the A7 main road in Flensburg, the staff of the winter service worked in a permanent way, but they could not overcome the snow did not stop accumulating.
Moreover, violent gusts swept the coast of the Baltic sea.
The Federal Office in charge with maritime shipping and hydrography (DSH) expects it to the tidal waves take place known the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water level that can reach 1.2 m above normal.
The snowdrifts on the highways and federal roads caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the power station of alarm of Meteomedia bad weather announced the purple level of alert was announced in Switzerland saxonne. in fact, it is the highest level.
In some places, it fell 30 centimeters of snow there fresh, strong winds and costs widely.
Several trucks and cars remained stuck at night.
Even in the Land of Saxony-Anhalt, the police announced serious unrest on the roads.
On the A2 highway, snow and wind led to an interruption of traffic and caused stoppers.
In Thuringe, the snowfalls hit the highways A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions of the rail traffic in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringe and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are. snow on the railway, fallen trees on the railways, destroyed overhead lines or needles.
In Saxony, we had to stop interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg.
In Sallfeld, Thuringe, ICE train bound for Munich had to stop his trip.
Fire and ancillary health, had to supply the 165 passengers on the train at covers, food and drinks.
Winds of snow swept roads.
The Snowfalls caused many flight cancellations of the main airports in Germany.
According to a spokesman for the norm and information on flights, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport indicates that 40 flights have already canceled at Frankfurt on Hand.
The winter service ensures a permanent service.
It is true that passengers stranded at the airport are not many more, despite that 400 beds are placed there at their disposal.
Accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
The evening with Ostholstein, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Because of the deposits of snow present on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg. even here, a truck was grabbed at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road ranging from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the early hours.
Moreover, a 30 year old woman died when her car flipped over on a slippery pavement in Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists announce good news. Snow will certainly be still soft and powdery, but it would whirl in the event of light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic will be afflicted by strong winds and rapids.
The weather is very cold, so less 15 degrees in some places.
Deutsche Bank is seeking a buyer for his twin towers.
The deutsche Bank seeks to separate from its emblem. According to the information reported by newspapers, the financial institution seeks buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The building could pay up to 500 million Euro.
Deutsche Bank has embellished the seat of the group. The twin towers in the District of business were modernized. in the meantime, bankers had to return to their former place of employment.
Now, the financial group clearly seeks to recover the costs of restorations and he seeks a buyer for its two buildings, like writes the paper's "the Financial Times Deutschland," citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not say why the planned sale.
He said "we check if it is more interesting to occupy ourself buildings or sell them and put them in hiring again later on."
So the biggest financial institution Germany already buckled his seat, shortly after.
It is only in the middle of 2007, the bank had acquired the twin towers for an amount of 272 million Euro to holders of equities. She was then rehabilitated them.
Energy transformation aimed to optimization absorbed, according to some indications, around 200 million euros.
A sale would bring obviously much money to the bank.
According to information furnished by the newspaper, the experts of this branch of industry estimate the value of the towers, renamed meanwhile "green Towers," to around 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesman, it is not currently known if the buildings will be sold again to fund part of the bank or an independent investor.
Thousands of people cry the miners who died.
In New Zealand, more than 10.000 people had a thought for the buried miners who were declared dead after several explosions that have occurred in the mine.
There had not yet been able to go up the bodies because secure the well disaster victim continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners whose age ranges between 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the disaster victim well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Because of the high concentration of poison gazs and other explosions that followed, no rescue team could go back into the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that the miners were no longer any to survive.
So far the bodies could not be gone up.
Now, parents and friends held a festival in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a sun burst with Greymouth in the south of New Zealand island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 buried miners, we installed 29 tables on which you could see the names, peacekeepers and lamps.
Photographs and personal effects, including clothing and boards of surfing, also had their place.
Flags were put in Bern in all public buildings.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said the participants in the commemorative festival which New Zealand fueled hope that the miners would rise to the surface.
"But they never returned home."
Mr Lawrie Has whose Zen son was buried in the pits said that it can not be resigned to accept the death of his son until he will not have seen his remainders.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of victims, many foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative festival.
Miners south - african and British origin also buried in the first explosion November 19th.
The first-aid workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine of the island, South of New Zealand.
The prefect of police Gary Knowles told journalists that when oxyhydrogen gas masses are misplaced, the extreme temperature inside the mine start to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
The Splatter movie an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old kind with his film, "Walhalla Uprising," epopee of the fighting.
How public the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn it may well think while turning "Walhalla Uprising?"
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) not having an eye is taken prisoner. it is liberated from its executioner and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates its opponents one after the other. That seems ideal for young male viewers in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal methods of murder. When it is bad mood, it tears off the intestines of its enemies without waiting for the dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the one-eyed it does not say a word about his real name. Even other characters allowed to escape, at most, to turn one or two phrases some cries of anguish terrible.
If not, it says nothing and feasts in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the decoration of the universe for the Vikings, about thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more mature filmmakers have an interest in existentialism and excellent dollies.
When a movie aimed several group-targets, it is damage that are mutually - exclusive.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the publication of "Pusher" Tractor, his trilogy on drug trafficker savage and full of style, as a kind of Quentin Tarantinon Danish, but he refuses to provide a mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality at the cinema and art test.
Most supporters of the cinema art must test horror of the brain that is spreading around and intestines.
The avid film-goers action die of boredom, when the one-eyed one embarks, for reasons that we can freely interpret, with a group of Christian missionaries violent on a ship bound for Jerusalem. they are drowned during an eternity by the calm and fog before the crew arrives in America and continues to kills himself.
It is not so surprising that Walhalla "Uprising" did not find any film distributor in Germany and that there is no one in DVD format.
It is especially because of beautiful images of the misery that deserved some attention, but also because the image of an exciting film, on occasion, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
They are not dialogues in this movie, nor a coherent action, is environment, a feverish dream turned into a film.
The spectator can not escape it.
Refn grants barely a moment to him relaxation and crosses to slow the throat with icy images and a dismal soundtrack, but especially with an elusive spouts hatred out of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who is faithfully held alongside the one-eyed, retains a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero whose mobiles are not known, but returns from hell constantly fighting enemies and allies temporarily while being turned into a warrior, perhaps as an envoy of the devil himself.
It is rotting, but perhaps also, for those who are, in any way, rotten.
"Walhalla Uprising" is an enigmatic film that you can hate or admire, who has a finality the irritation, enthusiasm and astonishingly.
A traumatic experience.
Excavation work mysterious
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications about a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to discuss this topic, much less subject to controls agency.
In the night of September 5th, 2007 around midnight at least four F-15 fighter packages I Israelis attacked a mysterious construction of cubic form on the Syrian territory.
It is located on the euphrates rivers. the greatest city in the neighborhood is 30 miles. it is Dair secure.
His name appears in documents from the IAEA, because it is the engine that Syria is built with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of an electrical current.
According to a briefing of the intelligence services of the United States, the CIA, going back to the end of April 2008, the current engine, known as neighboring locality, el-Kibar, would be ready to produce plutonium, which would make it possible to produce atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique applies for 1950 years.
The CIA has shown a video of presentation comprising the fuzzy satellite images.
The animation computer-assisted, he indicated the likely site of each component of the engine before the destruction of the power station, which represents a copy in miniature model of north korea's nuclear plant in Yongbyon.
Moreover, it presented the photographs showing the building located in the vicinity, even within this one.
It seems that the engine was about to be commissioned, but he has not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Now, more than three years after israel's bombing, has little more information than at the time, and even with the mystery thickens more and more.
Former us president George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built an engine with el-Kibar, but did not have peu' indices showing the country developed an "active nuclear weapons program."
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer being more cautious on this issue and talk about a supposed "engine," even though they view the presentation of the CIA as "plausible."
They lack of tangible evidence, as with the IAEA.
Asked about how he makes sure that it deals with nuclear reactor diplomat of senior of the United Nations gave only a laconic response in summer by claiming that the IAEA had "documents enough to ask questions."
The Syrians removed certainly with precipitation the rubble of the "military construction unutilised" and conducted an orderly flattening of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of experts from the IAEA led by the former chief inspector Oli Heinonen, discovered with el-Kibar uranium traces produces by men.
Moreover, the IAEA received from a Member State satellites images of commercial providers showing the moment that followed the attack directly. it seems that in the past are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are available on the market because anonymous silent partner, Israel granted them of exclusivity.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity in an objective way.
Syria has ensured that it had never made a secret atomic program and that it had built an engine.
Damascus that the uranium found at the site of the weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA challenged this argument after analyzing particles by describing it as amazing.
Since then, damascus refuses any discussion on this topic, like the images of satellite.
Moreover, Syria does not allow supervisors to perform a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and denial of access to the rubble of a building destroyed by the bomb.
But, even Israel retains a stubborn silence.
Confirming official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister, sitting at the time of the attack, said recently. "We will never make comments on this issue."
So the investigation relative to the case drags on since June 2008 without a achieving a result and that it "has turned increasingly become a serious problem credibility of the Agency," as recognizes a Western diplomat of senior service to the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna, finally he acts of a serious violation of the ban treaty of nuclear weapons.
The IAEA considers to make progress, it is necessary to clear up the existence of three other facilities that must have a "functional relationship" with meant the engine.
So far, neither the inspectors said that facilities it acts here, and that is their work or what they suspected to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung," they are known in the IAEA, respectively, under the names of Marj have-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also the name of neighboring towns.
The Institute independent Institute for Science and International Security (international institute for science and international security in Washington) identified those localities and discovered on satellites images of a complex near Masyaf which would likely be a suspect objects.
It is possible that it is in a military base or directly beside it. it is exactly why Syria refuses access to the three sites to inspectors of the IAEA.
In Vienna, said that the Syrians fear that the inspection is by way of spies who would be sent in the name of us by the IAEA in order to spy on military installations.
In fact, it is information provided by the us secret agents who drawn the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, showing that vehicles made shuttles between the three sites and parallelepiped of stone in order to transport drugs.
A Western diplomat of senior said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "be used for the production of fuel."
It would not have "no signals about the significant activities," such as enrichment and reprocessing uranium. processes that are essential to producing atomic weapons.
This type of engine works through certainly not enriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there is the rigor of plausible assumptions about the fundamental issues. hence the uranium should have come and where you would later separated plutonium to produce a bomb.
One ignores the rubble, which could hide traces of great value, were stored in the three sites.
When hundreds of trucks charged with soil disappear, nobody will have information on the stock room of rubble.
The IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria was at in 1998 Al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometres from el-Kibar, on the other side of euphrates rivers, to see whether it can be appropriate for the storage of radioactive waste.
Recently by analyzing photographs taken by satellite on behalf of the famous magazine Jane' S Intelligence Review, the former inspector of the IAEA, mr. Robert Kelley established a link between those and the engine into question.
Photos taken by satellite show that Syria has undertaken excavation work in the three sites suspect and moved huge containers when the IAEA began to require access to these places.
It is possible that it is a coincidence, but that did not contribute to dismiss the suspicions.
In he believes in diplomatic circles that the IAEA spent several months to prepare a plan on inspections to be executed. The plan was to allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only time invested shows that great interest the inspectors conduct in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus also despized this proposal.
A year ago, while Western diplomats in Vienna had not determined a report on the destruction of the engine, the urgency would not be announced for this business, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the ambassador of the United States who has spoken for months what is known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful means the atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who had to offer these inspections, certainly talked about "option that I am open in the future," but he still hesitates.
This means leads to enormous risk. on the one hand, it requires a majority of the board of governors of the IAEA and a good number of the 35 countries represented here does not want to see the situation knowing a scramble.
in addition, the diplomat who gives reflect. "It would be used, if at the end they do not find anything"
Love in wartime
That is poorly since Angelina Jolie made his start in summer as a director.
She wrote the script himself. it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and serbs man.
There is nothing more about this story, but that is enough to cause unease.
Persistent rumor that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her executioner serbs during the war with Yugoslavia.
The federations of the Bosnian women immediately protested. In response, some sequences of turning expected in Sarajevo was moved at the last minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the movie is made to Hungary, but phase in post-production, the protests have continued in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women war victims addressed a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through High Commission of the United Nations for refugees (UNHCR) and he demanded to meet the actress. Pretty ambassador of goodwill of the UNHCR is itself.
It is not diplomatic. A few weeks ago, it already offered to women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but declined the offer.
"The meeting will be held in Bosnia," Hasecic says.
There were stories of love in concentration camps, and the pattern of Pretty into known as rather long on its attitude towards victims.
The Guardian reports that the organization of Hasecic, subsequently recommended to the High Commission of the United Nations to remove the quality of ambassador of goodwill with Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, that kind of scenario Jolie did she write?
The Bosnian ministry of culture, which received copies of his scenario, awarded after some hesitation license of turning in Sarajevo, but we do not know why did not then come despite this authorization.
The young author ensures itself that it does not pursue political goals with his film, that he is in so many efforts that it was briefing the Yugoslav conflict. He argues that he wants to propose the terrible consequences of war and the possibility to all parts fascinating being expressed.
It remains vague about content.
A second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is rather different. In love, knew each other before the start of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a concentration camp where Serbian man working as a guard.
What is all this a big difference with the version "a victim of rape amourache its executioner."
That film Pretty began well before the war, of course.
The pressure is exerted on it, is shown Jolie, been "unfair and based on erroneous information."
Now, only the fanatics of Hollywood can get peace to him. By illegally putting this into the Net, like many others before.
Let us draw!
This evening, everything goes back to the Irish.

Cian Tanner is a quiet individual. this subtle play with drinking and reserved computer specialist, both behavior really does not work well together.
Yet despite that, the 26 year old young man seeks to have fun, to shun terebrant issue, which will lead to future.
The pleasure of playing Las Vegas does not appear in his plans. In January, he will direct job interviews in New Zealand.

Young people go away. The majority of families who live on the island like that of tanning.
Experts Research Institute of economic and social indicate that 100.000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They predict even a number 200.000 emigrants by 2015.
What is a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts are made, it will be present in emigration comparable to that from that Ireland suffered in 1980 years.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish have enjoys a great ease, sentence is now the place.
The economic crisis touches but especially the young Irish, well-trained, who had until now only moments of happiness.
Job loss and social forfeiture seemed absurd to years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there is money in excess.
But meanwhile, three people out of ten less than three years are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper abundantly publish the letters from readers written by young emigrants, who complain. "In Ireland, runs adrift."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but that the possibilities, from goes away and our country as a whole generation."
"The last to leave extinct light."

In January, he will continue to work on other projects Hanover or Berlin.
Meanwhile, Donovan O' rarely visits his native land, because it takes part in an extra work station, in order to be able to complete to repay the credit contracted to build his house with native land.
"The situation is already a nutcase," he says by crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I do not live in almost any more."
It erupts in laughter embarrassed by crossing the cold rooms.
Small house is in a residential area with just treated gardens in front, expensive cars famous brands are stationed on access roads.
Four years ago, Donovan O' bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380.000 Euros, funded with 100 pourcent by credit.
"They were moments of madness, no doubt, money was easy," he says.
Is he afraid to see a collapsing because of credit?
O' Donovan reflects a moment, is used again in the hot tea and declares: "I do not have kids to keep and I am young. if all goes from abortion, I set out to zero."
The engineering construction does not like the lamentations that he hears often lately.
"Nobody should suffer from hunger, our situation is not as dramatic as what we once lived here on the island," supports it.
"To work for a time abroad, it is not what can do no worse, perhaps it is what we feel first Irish.
He laughs and then talk about his father, who traveled to England in the last great economic crisis.
"It was back after having spent seven years there and in Ireland, life continued, simply."
The idea appeals Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and to discover how life happens elsewhere.
In his prize list, It is already a few years of work in London. That is why life should not be easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that worries him well in recent days. the festival to be held at its 27e anniversary in Dublin.
It fears that it could be turned into evening of farewell.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he said by drinking a beer mouthful.
"Farewell, it is worrying all the same."
"Call rather than an evening of goodbye, very relaxed, bringing together some friends, with some drinks and some plays."
Democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, just like that, the private company.
The crime became greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in most of the region.
They are there certain conclusions of Latinobarómetro poll taken in 18 countries and posted of exclusivity by The Economist.
Since the survey was executed systematically since 1995, it follows the change of attitude in the region.
Two related factors arise from the results of the survey this year, conducted in September and at the beginning of October.
The first is rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes toward democracy and his main institutions.
Support for democracy increased markedly in many countries on the circumference of the Pacific South America (see table 1).
For example, to Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% a year since 2002, support for democracy from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy was rectified having suffered a sharp drop in output last year.
But only about half of the guarantors in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries, are convinced democrats, which lower the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44% of the guarantors of the region were said not how democracy in their country worked in practice. he acts the same figure as last year but a sharp rise on the 25% in 2001 (3) graphic
Some 34% said they had confidence in Parliament from their country, and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases. but in sharply compared to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America, shook support for democracy.
If it was good for the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many of the country suffered only a brief recession and benefited from a strong recovery.
Moreover, a network of social security to protect the poor.
(Economic Committee of the United Nations for Latin America brought this week that the proportion of Latin - Americans living in poverty only cut this year and slightly in 2009, to 32%).
But mood varies significantly from one country to another (cf figure 4).
The economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula Da Silva, results in a shared sense of progress
What is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crime worsened.
It is only the second time since the poll began that guarantors across Latin America as a whole cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important issue for their country (see table 5).
About 31% say they or their close relationship was the victim of a criminal act in the past year. nevertheless, this figure is down from 38% last year and is low since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the rise in support for private enterprise, and a market economy. about 71% of the guarantors of the region say that private enterprise is essential for the development of 56% cf in 2007 (figure 6).
Some 58% believe the market is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the guarantors in Venezuela are of the opinion (and 80% support private company). even if their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, expropriates many private firms.
Brazil is the world's leader in the region, mentioned by 19% people polled (against 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by the guarantors in Mexico and in parts of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys the distinction in Ecuador, Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A soiled voting
Nobody expected to have perfect general election in Haiti on November 28th.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country's disaster victim and plunged into fear.
One presented boxes of ballot and a new poll, paper ballots dispersed in the goutières, trashed polling stations and intimidation
Polling stations opened the evening late.
Many Hatïens, including many ones who have been displaced following the sichuan earthquake of January, wandered nearby to find where to vote.
Some of them ended up giving up.
A dozen candidates for the presidency, including several alleged favourites, denounced the fraud and claimed the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Donkey, the top official in Haiti for the United Nations, sees the event as "a pretty good election in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean said wisely that they "did not believe that these irregularities, so severe are necessarily had invalidated the process."
In other words, the spectacle continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to Rene Préval, unpopular incumbent, with its candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on December 7th.
The long-awaited second round is scheduled for January.
Any hope the election is not lost.
Two candidates, Michel Martelly, a musician of rap, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, were removed from their initial call for the vote is declared zero.
But there can be problems if mr. Célestin, who has little or no perceptible support among voters is declared by the electoral authority as having reached it second to toura reached the second round.
A cholera epidemic that makes rage, and more than 1 million survivors of the earthquake, who still live in tents, feared that the turnout would be.
In fact, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, to vote, shortly before the election was not distributed.
The challenge is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as a milestone in the rebuilding of Haiti.
And so it is clear, Haitians do them-even.
The feet to the centre
Weeks after being suddenly become widowed, Cristina Fernández, argentina's president, enjoyed a wave of sympathy from the public that has improved its approval rate of 20 percentage points, to more than 50%. it is about sound plus highest level since she was elected in 2007.
But to transform it into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Mrs Fernández, obviously in mourning, that it would abandon or not the intransigence of her late husband and predecessor, former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, incidentally, the signs remain confused.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to manage the economic policy, even after his wife to succeed him as president, used to working out budgets that undervalued the revenue, economic growth and inflation.
That enabled the first couple to at will spend the extra money.
The government of Mrs Fernández lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the bogged down in the turmoil following the death of Mr Kirchner of a heart attack on October 27th.
Some of the dissident members of the peronist movement to power joined Mrs Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where a member of Parliament struck in the face one of its peers and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not need to approve the 2011 budget.
"I can not disagree," the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president still more room to spend at will.
The economy largely overheats. it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate accounts now for 11.1% but many private estimates and salary demands from the unions, see this figure closer to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made a priority of growth and poverty reduction, rather than the control of inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, he harassed the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which conducted falsifications of official statistics on inflation.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
It called for talks between private companies and trade - union leaders.
And officials say that they want to limit pay rises next year to 18%.
The economy was driven by high world prices for agricultural exports to Argentina.
But inflation eroded the nudge in the right direction to growth after a sharp devaluation in 2002.
It is perhaps why Mrs Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore financial relations with Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the government concluded an agreement with bondholders who had rejected a previous restructuring forced debt for Argentina had not solved its expiries in 2001.
Now ms Fernández appears to Be edging towards year agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, which owes nap $6.7 billion.
Kirchner has always insisted that it would not involve a surveillance by the IMF, as it is used.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Economy Minister, announced that the Fund would provide a "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index. what looks like a prelude of sanitation of INDEC.
It is not clear if Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of his term, now that her husband is no longer at his side.
If he does, he needs to win the support of the middle class, including the kirchnerism is preached.
When argentines return their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for him will have ebbed.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide to repudiate or not, without noise, many policies of her husband.
A half-hurrah for China
Taiwanese voters are headed toward a closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think his big brother located on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters presented on November 27th, 70% of acceptable people to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban school districts, in what is seen as a general assessment of president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma has itself become a substitute for the sensations compared to the continent, having tied innovative business ties, including a pact partial free trade, the biggest restructuring of the relationship with China itself since 1949.
Successful m. My test, but just.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) won three of the five town halls, he failed to win a majority of the votes.
Instead, the democrat-progressist Party (DPP), which collateralized to full independence for Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT 45%.
If this had been a presidential ballot, I would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of the vote his party fell from about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in the town councils.
The event has revealed the main subjects of Taiwanese, including trucks with noisy campaign and flags of mass rally with girls who danced in minimal behavior.
An obligatory mysterious assassination attempt was also perpetrated.
Sean Link, son of Chan Link, honorary president of the KMT, led an election tour for a candidate of the KMT the day before the election.
A crowd shot at young mr. Lien, purely across the face, wounding him and killing a passer by.
Oddly, it was not determined if the gunner wanted to do wrong with mr. Lien or to settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, said Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had implications for the election while directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the greatest winner of the election.
It was striking to see how the mainland part was absent.
Instead, the candidates have tournament with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan's normally enjoys independence in fact, hate the military threat from China.
The KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also has refrained from poking the anti-Chinese sentiment.
It is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to the survival of Taiwan.
Mr Ma, for its part, claimed a confirmation whether its policy on China were acceptable for Taiwanese majority.
One can expect that the government in Beijing continues to provide commercial facilities, in line with his strategy which aims at deluding Taiwan, return to the fold.
China did not waste time to send a negotiator to Taipei to host a summit on the protection of investment and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration. but let us start with the beginning.
Better to wait for that after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP was in any event itself.
Two years ago, he was wrong. its former chief, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison following accusations of corruption.
President of 2000 to 2008, he was an agitator for explicit independence.
But a new generation of temper was born under the direction of Mrs Tsai and the DPP put all books about it to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs Tsai was hailed as a candidate for the DPP to the presidency, as Su Tseng-chang, which was useful in mr. Chen.
Their party is were sound to better show than can also begin with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their talks can take place without preconditions.
Mrs Tsai said the Taiwanese public that his party presents an "alternative worthy of confidence" from the precipitated approach of mr. My of China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the PDP would have got better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered mr. Su, pragmatic, not to run for the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr Chen, the DPP will have to choose between its potential candidates.
It is necessary that the KMT makes the introspection of yourself.
Assessments of mr. My were low. despite a staggering economic growth, the candidates KMT did not want to campaign with him.
His unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT says that his cabinet as its local antennas will be altered.
The performance of the PDP suggest that support in Taiwan for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanais see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "point of no return already passed."
Appointments at the Grammy Awards. the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprisingly selected in the category of "best new artist"
To perform at the request of the president, and people are required to take note.
Esperanza Spalding, the bass player and jazz singer 26 year old rallied to hand by president Obama to happen at the time of his ceremony of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with the appointment of large scale in the category of "best new artist."
Given that Spalding is a very well-known figure on the stage of the jazz since his 2008 album, "Esperanza," the appointment is a bit mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist should leave more than three albums before the recording. "what proves the public identity of that artist."
His ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society," marked certainly a step forward and, given his vocal style slightly engaging, his skillful hand a pop and funk and Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a dotted line with Spalding compared to the fulgurating success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for voters to the Grammy Awards considering production of jazz in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, voters of the Grammy Awards honored rightly "Historicity" with Vijay Iyer Trio in the category of "instrumental album," transferred on reinvigorating a shiver of a recording that was one of the crucial favourites last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" clavierist John Beasley will be particularly in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a favorite with the raucous voice of new orleans and frequent guest on "Treme" HBO, were honored in the category of contemporary jazz. who inclines himself strongly in addition to an unquestionable merger with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of fierce Darcy James Wire-drawer, familiarized with steampunk, won some recognitions deserved in the category big unit. compete with rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Together and adventurous eternal Dave Holland, whose album "Pathways" ring octet' S live was a good example of democratic hands of the bass player as a team leader.

The appointments for 53e annual Grammy Awards include a mixture of landscapes of musicians and composers of the world.
At the top of the appointments include "Deus Ex Machina" Michael Daugherty, for piano and orchestra, with five "yes." and "Dreamhouse" Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "yes."
Among the nominated, having ties to California, there is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony n°4, "Los Angeles," a work that was commissioned by the Philharmonic Orchestra of Los Angeles and opened Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, are also candidates for a reward.
The appointments are distributed in 13 categories covering the recordings of the orchestra, opera, choral and solo.
A category for the traditional producer of the year puts the star five candidates. Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The appointments for the traditional album are Symphonies N °3 and 4 of Bruckner the royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of " "Deus ex machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" Daugherty of Nashville Symphony Orchestrated.

The project of the mosque of Temecula win the approval of the planning commission.
A mosque in Temecula received the unanimous support of the local planning after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics were caught some with the project by claiming that it made promoting terrorism as well as congestion of traffic.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday evening that the new religious center complied with local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many people even came to support it. Christians, Jews, Bahaïs, you mention it," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I am proud, as an American citizen."
"That shows that justice prevail."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m and lasted until almost midnight, with most of the time, people deciding for or against the center of the word about also distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There is no America," a speaker wrote.
"It is about another planet of the apes with Miss Liberty died in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic center also caused protests in other parts of the country, including Ground Zero, place the attacks of September 11th, 2001, perpetrated in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in Temecula Valley.
His congregation of about 135 families coexists without incident in the county of Riverside for years but she wanted a larger space and better than the warehouse than she lauded on a property shared with a manufacturer systems of water filtration.
The new mosque of 24.943 square feet to the architecture of Mediterranean style would be composed of two minarets and would rise to 43 feet above.
It will occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the road Nicolas about two miles east of Chaparral high school.
Opponents can still make call on this project at the city council.
A microbe tolerating arsenic raises the possibility of new types of lives on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, widens the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although the researchers discovered unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say shows that life has options beyond the major elements that were considered essential.
"This organization has a double capacity."
"It can have either phosphorus, or arsenic."
"That is why it is peculiar, even if it is far from being a "foreign" form of life really, Paul Davies C.W commented on. University of Arizona, joint author of the report appearing in the online edition of Thursday in the journal Science.
Six major factors were considered long as essential for life. carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But the researchers found that the bacterium, discovered in the Mono lake in California, is able to continue to develop having replaced phosphorus by arsenic.
"One wonders what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. University of Arizona, joint author of the report.
The discovery is important for search for life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, knowing what life is like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, did not reveal the details of the lucky find, generated speculation spread on the Internet that the report could reveal the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
"The discovery shows that, in other global environments, organizations may be able to use other elements to actuate biochemistry and that "standard" all the elements that we judge absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," commented on Charles Cockell, a professor at the planetary science Institute and spacial, Open University, Milton Keynes, uk.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new, because it shows the substitution of an element to another basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It was not an accident discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Institute of Astrology NASA, who led the study, chose the Mono lake because it is equipped with high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar. so, she speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances may be able to substitute each other.
"Arsenic is toxic, mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, the agencies find it hard to distinguish these elements separately."
"But arsenic is sufficiently different that it does not work exactly as phosphorus. it penetrates inside and, to some extent, gums the work of our biochemical machine," explained Anbar.
Researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed to increased arsenic concentrations that it could adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic in place raises the possibility that some form of life with arsenic can occur naturally, or else on Earth and another planet or the moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamy S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University Of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic may be replaced by phosphorus was not new. but it never showed it could work.
Arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the existence of the Earth, she said. so the researchers made the assumption that the first forms of life could have used it.
That suggests that there may be other ways of forming life, not only how life on Earth was formed at the start," said Foster, who was not part of the research team Wolfe-Simon.
The research was funded by NASA, the department of Energy and the National Institute of health.
The last two stolen dogs were found exposure in Compton
The other two dogs exhibition on four stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower were found, the sheriffs in the county of Los Angeles have the Thursday announcement.
The four dogs exhibition - two akitas and two pembroke Welsh corgis, disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the van Chevrolet Express in which they had spent the night outside a motel 6 in Bellflower, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the two others were found at the end of the evening Wednesday, said to Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the department of sheriff of the county of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that dogs are well," Whitmore said.
"They are fine forms."
"They were restored to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in which district and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is underway."
"We do not want to say it," Whitmore he said.
"We follow orders."
Owners of dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could be joined to provide a comment Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday afternoon with two Akitas a haven for animals county located in Downey.
The aides of the sheriff found the van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akitas - Chart, a 3 year old male, and Didi, a 10 month old female - were healthy and safe, authorities announced.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show regional contests this week on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were reported missing until their discovery Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, city this weekend in the national championship "AKC/Eukanuba" Long Beach, where they intended to Trace.
Other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions other tests expected in the days before the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba," Peek at Times said Wednesday.
California from the South is one of the stops the round of canine exposure nearly a month of the couple.
Monday evening, Peek and Rickard true in the motel.
They often remain in the motels and park their van outside, next to the window of their room.
They took along three other dogs - a Boxer pup, a burrow Parson Russell and Breton spaniel, which remained with them in the bedroom of the motel.
But they left Akitas and corgis, thicker fur, in the van, where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a bit, so that the dogs could have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van to 6. a.m Tuesday.
Peek said that they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, provided with a micropuce established to identify them.
It is not clear if a reward were granted Thursday.
The lion is not ready to redden, the restructuring of MGM does not expect any more but the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to resume zero.
A federal judge in the bankruptcy in New York, officially leased the plan Thursday "prepackaged" by creditors that about 5 billion of the debt would be wiped out. opening the way for the entertainment company, 86 years old in existence, to focus its efforts on production and distribution film and television programs.
The decision Thursday, according to the content requirements with the code into bankruptcy with the United States, plus any legal impediment do not remain before MGM to recover flooding under the tutelage of the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the chief executive officers of what will be a small studio.
Staff will be brought to about 320 from 400 at the beginning.
MGM will not emerge from Chapter 11 as long as JPMorgan Chase will not be concluded a credit easing from 500 million, designed to finance the operations and production of MGM.
It is currently distributed under license by the investment bank, who encounters to 75 million, and should be funded around mid-December.
The process of restructuring the studio began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was engaged to advise the direction of the way of putting its finances since he did not have the means to pay the interest a year rising to 300 million.
In August, chief executive officer, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former ceo of Enron and an expert in recovery known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts by Moelis and Cooper to solve the financial problems of MGM and to meet the 140 creditors with the studio took more time than expected.
After several months of talks, the parties agreed at the end of 2009 to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few tenderers among whom none of them was willing to pay the sum of 2 billion more, whose creditors were research.
In the spring of this year, it was necessary to again while the team of MGM had started working on a restructuring plan that, after months of disagreements and internal debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM leaves officially bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper receive bonuses of several million for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received 1.2 million, will receive a payment of 9.5 million dollars.
The companies Cooper, who collected 375,000 $ per month for their services management firm, will receive a bonus of "success" of 4 million.
To bore and Birnbaum intends to boost production of MGM, which left one film this year, and on foot an annual list of seven or eight films that would leave starting from 2012.
They also intend to cofinance two movies based on "the Hobbit," with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $ 265,000,000 and $ 275 million to fund its share of both films, which must be led by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM debt, tried to execute a merger of the studio with Lions Spoils Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent talks between the two companies did not lead to an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your budget in balance donated
Although the main candidate for the most marvelous toy of the year is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by the video game, Microsoft's Kinect, both can make a significant breach in your budget gifts.
Consider, for the price of the iPad, you can buy five BMX bicycles to 99 $ and play Kinect cost the same price as 10 skipping ropes of traditional beads, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways of keeping your gifts budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national sellers of toys - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Custom and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys that I could buy for less than $ 80.
It is clear that de Moore's Law changed, technological toy of the year is likely to have more force. while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
Moreover, while there are typically fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most famous of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the pile button toys are rising, as well as the rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Custom, unless contrary indication).
Sing-have-my-jigs (Mattel, $ 13 per 3) and soft toys are the size of a guinea-pig who sing a note when you to press them on the belly.
Pressure is equal to see, and a second allows to compose a song.
If you buy some many, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: once you start, you can no longer stop you.
To combine the song to dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $ 60 per 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Taking as a starting point the technology of Elmo Live last year, the animatronic doll 14 inches plays games to look like Simon Said, and can make the lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with locking wheel.
Children who essyaé the toy Mickey uses as an instructor of dance while their parents complain about a lack of control of volume.
If you are a child of the 1980's, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He is back (Hasbro/Playskool, $ 40 per 3 years and more), with a rucksack filled with cards to play questionnaire designed to transform a strolls in the car in a session with autocorrection and a sorter of valves.
If you are wary when your child has your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
Mobigo de VTech (60 $, 3 to 8 years) is cheaper and easy to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as To Explore the Leapster 70 ($, 3 to 12 years), he acts of the first major overhaul of the Leapster range, with more recent and more luminous screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The Fisher-Price iXL of $ (90, 3 to 7 years) uses a system of iTunes kind to offer games and e-books and is equipped with an entry for SD card that allows display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($ 30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a set of five blocks barely bigger than a box of matches, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by putting the blocks online before time passes, it is ideal for an impromptu contest of orthography.
Increasingly, the toys have some sort of connection online.
While basing itself on its presence in the stores of toys, two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
Buying to your child a pet in line with the Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2 n 'Mix Match Is Pack, 5 $, 6 to 12 years) that includes a marked part of a hidden code.
When you to buy the code online, your child receives sufficient credit to the store Club Penguin for two articles with choices.
It can be a question of roller skates or a pet Puffle toy.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your brush with teeth, Hexbug Nano ($ 10, for 5 years, and more) is past the pile button microphone-robots.
The false small beast moves quickly on 12 vibrant silicone pastes in random directions.
It is amusing to make a labyrinth of roadblocks to see whether it can find its way through.
It is also robust.
Ours withstood a fall in the kitchen table and even a temporary passage in the mouths of our dog.
To provide a softer side to the maintenance of law and order to China
Tang Shenbin surveyed a place in the city as a sergeant with urban learning inspecting his nervous charges severely, while emitting with low voice orders to military authorities.
He wanted female members of chengguan, imposing responsible for law and order in China, feared and scorned for their arbitrary repression and penchant for violence - transmit a certain impression of a set of spectators.
"You Keep right!"
"Be piercing!"
Show, he tells them, "like the pretty girls!"
Four girls have just passed their teens in white gloves, dressed in identical jackets and trousers of color olive, solidified with the attention.
Four pairs of black shoes with heel, ranks with the rule.
Four cured hats perfectly perched atop hair attached by a node tigre in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," Mr Tang said, with disdain.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government tried to refresh the image of urban inspectors.
A city required that all new recruits have a diploma of higher learning.
Guangdong province traded the greenish grey uniforms against a blue supposedly more engaging.
Wuhan in central China, replaced lower-the-eyes by the way:: in 2009, a report warned that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack bar trolley while launching black looks, firmly over half an hour, until the hawker packs up again his business and leaves.
Xindu, an urban district 680,000 people in Chengdu, chose to make a big operation image.
Since 2003, the district completed its police streets in the urban environment of 13 women, especially chosen for their appearance, contour and their young age.
The idea is to give the trimmed police a softer side, more feminine.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulty in attracting look at the underground urban China brigade
And because, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these agents are allowed to enforce the municipal prescriptions by imposing administrative fines or other sanctions.
But Chinese media depict the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors from the province of Hubei beat to death an observer after he used his cell phone to film them dispersing a protest against a discharge of waste.
Last year, a training manual for the inspectors in Beijing, elusive and online, described how to overcome the delinquents without emitting effectively blood.
This year in Shanghai, water mellon hawker was dropped with a brain injury after a brawl with five officers.
A video game steeped in violence, available for download online, watch the Chinese inspectors trained with the attack on the street sellers.
"Chengguan accused the government last year regretted China Daily, a national publication, after the umpteenth controversy over tactics.
The newspaper claimed a "real full cleansing."
Skeptics say that approach is far.
After the district passed an announcement in October to find eight new recruits female, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, questioned whether the women had real tasks or if they were a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The announcement of the district demanded female candidates, aged between 18 to 22 years, having a beautiful silhouette and "the five traits of the face in good order."
They must have a higher than average, about 1.6 meters, or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
Retirement at 26 is compulsory.
Officers said that work was physically too painful for women in more than 25 years.
"It is their image is important," a director of district told Rednet.com, a website quasi-governmental.
"First, qualities external candidates will determine whether they agree. it is the size, weight, features of the face, etc."
The temperament and "internal qualities come."
The Chengguan women are as vases of flowers, he said, adding: " "In addition, vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy editor of the board of management district of the city, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that the demands about the tune was the standard norm in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
Such is the demand on the order of the features of the deal.
That means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Yes, disabled or disfigured people should not premise.
"We can not leave a person limps or uneven to be useful here," mr. Zheng said.
"It is not a good image."
Liu Yi, which patrols on the Baoguang place near a monastery, aged 22 and finely has the dappled cheeks with a curved mouth.
She does not regard the development of her appearance as gender-based, she said.
"Do you Think I am sexy the air in uniform?" she asked a disenchanted air.
Xu Yang, his colleague with the 21 year old small cavities, said. "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They are not opposed to their mandate is limited, they said, because they feed greater ambitions career than simply hunting sellers in the lanes where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen traveling merchants who move quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying as much as possible to sell rolls or bowls of tofu before escape.
"Major Wang, you must leave."
"We have said to you several times!" Mrs, Xu said, while a salesman fled on foot, abandoning his bicycle-cart with noodles temporarily.
The agents rather describe their functions as monotonous that difficult.
"It is the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, 20 years old, which studies marketing after work.
"Routine."
One reason is that the female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the assets of sellers.
They can only threaten to announce the contraveners to their male superiors.
That tends to protect them from exposures of sudden public animosity against the bureaucracy which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, capital of Yunnan province, revolted after spreading false rumors that agents of the chengguan had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and agents of the chengguan were injured, 14 vehicles from the government were reversed or set on fire.
Xindu has eluded so far with such violence.
But calm is not guaranteed.
Just two blocks of homes in the placid Baoguang place, where officers of female sex patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
The agents confiscated a motor bike which was being repaired on the pavement rather than in a shop, like theirs imposes regulations.
The owner of the motor bike cried scandal.
A 15 minute old arm wrestling followed before the police, with the grim face, cut a path to blows of elbow into their vehicle and left at any speed with the motor bike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to male team, remained behind, white badge returned to hide its name.
As the officers of female sex, the coordinators - 40 years old or more - play a role in purely support.
Unlike them, they are not trained in order to maintain an image waxed.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we struggle physically," said Mr Li said a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it is the public that begins."
Prosecutors will not accuse senator Ensign
Prosecutors from the Justice ministry raised the charges related to senator John Ensign, rising from a business linked to an assistant of an old campaign and his efforts to get lobbying work for the husband of the woman, have announced Wednesday the lawyers senator.
The decision puts an end to the legal most serious threat faced by mr. Ensign, republican of Nevada was considered a possible republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election until the scandal around its business does not make national headlines last year and hurt his career.
The office of mr. Ensign said he was "very happy" with the decision result of a year-long investigation.
Senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the senate ethics committee.
Lawyers for mr. Ensign said that the ministry of Justice had warned that senator Ensign was no longer subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to keep in any charges against him in this affair."
The ministry of Justice has refrained from comment on this topic.
The announcement came as a surprise to many lawyers ethics outside the ministry of Justice, that there would be significant evidence showing that mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mail and other documents, initially communicated in October 2009 in the New York Times, said that mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his aides, to obtain a work of lucrative lobbying to win the silence of mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, in connection with the case of senator with it.
Mrs Hampton once was useful to trésorière a campaign Ensign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political money-lenders to find work for mr. Hampton and then he defended their rights after they hired mr. Hampton to be lobbying for them. according to documents and interviews.
Since mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of mr. Ensign, it was him banned for one year by law to lobbying from his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
The ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between mr. Ensign and mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, seems inconsistent with the ban known as the revolving door of lobbying.
According to the evidence that was made public, "there appears to be a prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and substantive violation of the law of the revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defense customers of an investigation by the government.
Although the justice department declined to explain the reasoning that led to the decision Ensign affair, mr. Brand and other lawyers in ethics said that the department seemed to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of high-level setbacks boxed by its slice of the public integrity, including the decision last year to abandon the prosecution against former senator Ted Stevens accused of pursuing fault.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, director of citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington, a defense group that received several complaints against mr. Ensign in the case.
"That basically says high-ranking government officials edge now has assumed the laws don' T apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, a principal of mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received Monday a phone call from a prosecutor for the ministry of Justice and followed the next day, claiming that the department did not seek charges against his client.
A team of lawyers for mr. Ensign had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that senator, such as his office Wednesday reaffirmed it in an official statement, had "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments that it had made with parquet floor.
"I am not uncomfortable to get into the details of my discussions with the ministry of Justice, except that we believe that they made the right decision," said for it.
Last month, the federal Commission on Elections decided to abandon an investigation following a complaint by independent group of ethics, supporting the payment of 96,000 $ by the parents of mr. Ensign, Hampton violated federal election law.
The electoral commission said he did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was all but a gift.
NV Energy, the largest company of Nevada who supported senator a long time, is a company for which mr. Ensign helped mr. Hampton to find lobbying work.
E-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company received mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, the principal private secretary to mr. Ensign, John Lopez, communicated with mr. Hampton and told him that he "hammered" the Interior ministry on a question in litigation.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with mr. Hampton and another customer of Nevada, and Allegiant Air, and he asked the secretary of transportation to fix a meeting in the name of the airline having urged mr. Hampton to lobbying.
When news of the affair made surface last year, mr. Ensign excused himself from his constituents and resigned his leadership post the fourth - largest republican in the Senate.
Having kept a low profile for several months, mr. Ensign said it has been two weeks that it intended to run for a third term in the Senate.
By announcing that mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the ministry of Justice and would end its investigation.
Senator Ensign is happy to continue his baited in the name of the people of Nevada, she said.
The appeal of Cheshire will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were typing with far the lines of the courtroom.
They sent every minute of the horrific reports of testimonies via Twitter.
At the end, defense said that there were more than 140,000 messages on trial for rape case and children attached to their bed in a house was burned.
Thursday, the trial largely followed by Steven J. Pendulum, who was convicted of the murder of three family members Cheshire, Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, passed by the jury.
But lawyers for mr. Hayes have to deposit evidence to the court that outline case of appeal, will occupy the courts for years.
What is aggressive, it is that the intense reports on trial, as well as use widespread and extended by journalists on Twitter - created an "atmosphere of circus," so widespread and instant saturation with incendiary details the jury was badly influenced by the passions of the public.
The demand could push the judges call to be discussed on the question of whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I made the experience during the trial. I think there is a real danger the introduction of new technologies into courtrooms undermines the rights of the person to a fair trial," Thomas J. Ullmann, a lawyer for mr. Hayes, chief lawyer said.
The judge in the trial, Jon C. Blue of the Superior Court, laconically rejected claims the judgment made last week, claiming that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been animated by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
The courses call recognize decades that the media coverage of the notorious cases could raise questions about the fairness of the trial.
In a 1966 judgment that date, the United States Supreme Court reversed the conviction of an osteopath in Cleveland, dr. Sam Shepard, for the assassination of his wife, supporting in its decision that there was an "atmosphere of carnival to the trial" because of media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television program and movie "the fugitive."
Some lawyers said that the court of appeal took to revisit half a century later condemnation of Mr Hayes can be curious given the argument that new rules would be needed to manage communications in courtrooms, unimaginable in the case of dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in the trials of large-scale, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the school of Law Stanford who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that she was arbitrarily enforced.
Professor Donohue asserts that some judges call could be intrigued by the idea that limit of instant communication from courtrooms could allow fairer trials.
The case of Twitter only one among many others, is described by the lawyers mr. Hayes, likely to be discussed for years. what delays the execution.
The defense counsels also say, for example, that mr. Hayes would have suffered an injury when Blue judge refused to allow them to test the reaction of potential jurors in their showing pictures of macabre crime scenes in the selection of the jury.
Some sworn said to be horrified by the photos at the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Small, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
The defense counsels say that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unfairly expelled one sworn, which had been critical in front of the prosecutors, and that it mistakenly put pressure for a verdict by the unusual decision to lead the jury to deliberate in one weekend.
Sworn were not sequestered.
But their arguments about the effect of intense media coverage of the trial may be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a challenge against the verdict, filed last month that the case has dominated the media landscape in Connecticut and that he was discussed during the campaign by the candidates to the post of governor and the Senate of the United States.
They maintained that the information media did not stop poking the flames of the emotion of business.
"The scuffle of the tweets of media cameras and reporters before the law courts," the lawyers wrote, "did not resemble nothing of what had been seen before, here in New Haven, and perhaps even national scale."
Their focus on the cover of the Twitter system is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim, according to whom the instant news was more incendiary than official statements given more slowly, was a sight luddist that would impoverish the policy governing Court coverage of the future trials.
But some lawyers said that the prices of call étaitent often attracted by the arguments that social and technological changes required an adaptation by the courts.
Lawyers for mr. Hayes insist on this claim.
Their record, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 that had reversed the conviction of dr. Sheppard because media coverage of the trial and specified that they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
"This affair," they wrote, " that Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century is. "
Civility can bring divisions?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is it a harbinger of a genuine bipartisan cooperation forward or illusory time before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The meeting Tuesday between president Obama and the leaders of Congress did not produce any breakthrough on the big issues that must be addressed during the session "lame - duck."
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two sides as in recognition of their shared responsibilities being controlled, rather than an episode where each side wanted to mark points. vacuum rating not in favour.
The public meeting Wednesday of the commission on the deficit was president too civilized, despite political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that the narrow interaction several months created a mutual respect transcending the ideological divide. but, however, still divides members.
It is not enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has happened.
The two sides are now for a trial period and testing period mutual in order to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed war partisan.
That is why the meeting Tuesday and later comments of the participants revealed a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid change in climate that existed over the last two years.
It acts of taxes, spending, healthcare or rights, the two sides remain miles away.
However, the election of November had moderate Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed the tone," Pete Wehner, a civil servants of the Bush administration declared, now at the side of the Center for ethics and public Policy.
"It is inevitable after the election.
The election cause partisan passions and then they are estomptent.
It is."
On some issues, especially those on the agenda "" lame - duck session, republicans and democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Tax cuts Bush will expire at the end of the year, and nobody is in favour of it.
Both sides want to find a way of preserving a part of it or unity, a permanent or temporary basis.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment pays, if only because the republicans can not afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits to workers without jobs.
After the meeting Tuesday at the White House, more optimism planes on a possible deal about the issues mentioned during the session, "lame - duck," with ratification of the pact "New START."
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution, informs that a fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the session "blade" duck will not necessarily lead to a better deal between the two parties when 112e congress meets in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely, even inevitable.
"Once the things that must be done will be psychology in the short term will return to one of confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his skepticism widely shared view that civility would lead to a full-fledged cooperation.
"I think most of what happens between now and 2012 as a pre-spectacle or a shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012, said At it.
The reasons are closely tied to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and voters in tea, who helped create.
But republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to cut public spending and repeal the new law on healthcare.
These partisan positions are now clear in the initial reaction to the recommendations of the commission, which include reforming the tax code and increase some taxes, pushing back the retirement age and cutting spending.
The copresidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to themselves, imposed the deficit on the public agenda in a way that can not be ignored.
But they need 14 vote in the committee, made up of 18 members to their plan as an official recommendation, and they had to reach that number.
The greatest resistance is among elected leaders of the group. that suggests that there is on fiscal issues, at least today, few reasons or for compromise.
Galston plans two phases in the fighting between the White House and republicans in Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of clashes in favour, because republicans disagree on Obama's budget, taxes and healthcare. and then be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
That would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans wants to always see the two parties working together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as in 1995, then both parties will be watching the public reaction closely.
That will be judged in loss will have to change course and to find compromises.
But it is nevertheless an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are higher now than they were in the middle of 1990 years and there seems to be an ideological wider gap between Obama and republicans in Congress that there was no between president Bill Clinton and the republicans.
At the same time, activists in both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a larger election in 2012.
Given this reality, exposed civility this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But you will need a lot more effort on the part of both parties to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
Revealed American documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
Control of the city in the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and pass the Kremlin part of the bribes and money protection it collects, announced the embassy in Russia in a note in February.
Police and the Federal Security Service achieve huge rackets that help explain the high cost of life in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only legitimate companies but also organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "vertical of power" --takes its share while the money walks on to the top.
The memorandum, which was sent to Washington as Ambassador John Beyrle, was displayed Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The bill is based on sources whose names were expurgated.
It was written when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow. and it is held accountable for corruption.
He was fired in October by president Dmitry Medvedev but since then, there were few traces of cleansing.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who has a construction firm prominent always denied accusations of corruption over the years. and it won several trials in libel on these charges.
In September, he said that follows a Russian television channel, when he was asked about documentary suggesting that it was corrupt. "It is crazy, it is throwing, there is nothing."
Russians believe, with the overwhelming majority that their company is corrupt. according to the poll.
But it is unusual to find information said in a report embassy. and it is stunning to imagine that would be to diplomats in a foreign country to do so.
The direct connection drawn up between the city of Moscow and crime has led some to call it the "dysfunctional" and asserting that the government worked better as a kleptocratie that government," according to the bill of the embassy.
"Criminal elements enjoy a" krysha " (a term used in the world criminel/la Mafia which literally means" roof "or protection) that passes through police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Interior ministry (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as throughout the bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analysts to identify a structure in three levels in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB and MVD militias are on the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are on the level low."
"It is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fills a void in some areas where the city does not provide other services."
The report indicates that the FSB brews money of the largest companies and the police target small.
A source, he said, "explained why the owners of society Moscow understood that it was better for the protection of the FSB and MVD (rather than groups organized crime) because, not only, they have more guns, more money and power more that criminal groups but they are also protected by the law. "
"That is why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer."
The bill says that, while collecting money is widespread, protecting itself can be uneven. even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business shutdown under a pretext or another.
Medvedev spoke several times the fight against corruption but he admitted the little progress.
The bill for the embassy transmits to reports of men who bring bags, filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," said in a recent interview, Gueorgui Satarov, director of the Indem think "reservoir" of Moscow.
"But it belongs to the bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because there are not some in Russia."
Without the policy without opposition, separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the costs of corruption would rise to the level of whole Russia, with more than 300 billion dollars a year.
The country was ranked 154e in a recent poll on the global perception of corruption by Transparency International non-governmental organization (countries are rated at least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the bill for the American embassy, which has been conducted only yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow, will stir up with certainty of discontent within the Russian government. although Luzhkov can be blamed, to some extent, for the failures of Moscow, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is solve the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin made the assumption that the documents to WikiLeaks could be a manufacturing and reacted with anger in remarks that diplomats from the United States had revealed by calling it Batman and bringing closer Medvedev to Robin.
"The problem rests on the fact that it is about our interaction, significant factor in domestic politics in this country, he says.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that would be executed with such arrogance, such a pressure and, you know, in contrast to ethics."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past
In a poorly enlightened classroom with decrepit concrete walls of poor quality, secondary principal Anlong Veng mentioned the man who built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"It was a good leader. and he was concerned about his people," said Sreng Kor My 42 year old.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when it was the Khmer Rouge commander, remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he made build hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure. and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the government, loyalty long is reconsideration in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation enabled the victims to publicly address with people who had taken part in the regime.
In June, the government allocated to a manual high school, which for the first time, tells the story of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a cambodian court, run jointly with the un, uttered his first sentence of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, by condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the notorious torture center of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better - known as "Duch."
In this picture, increased anxiety among veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng. complicating the efforts of reconciliation and their wills to reintegrate himself into cambodian society.
"There are fears and resentments among former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said Youk Chhang, director of the Reference Library of Cambodia, an independent organism that undertakes research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"The situation creates divisions within families."
Under the rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease and overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government of pol. Pot-Plain in 1979, the regime and its army fled to Cambodia border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurgency that lasted until the last of the movements is in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary led the guerrilla their base located in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok are planned in Anlong Veng.
But in the 1990 years after a peace agreement sponsored by the un led to the first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to make defection to the government, culminating with the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 until his trial.
Without their benefactors, most Khmer Rouge veterans bogged down in utter poverty, common in rural regions of Cambodia. and many people remain nostalgic movement.
Although some Khmer Rouge officers from elite retained their posts local leader in exchange for having deposited weapons, it acts farmers unskilled with low - largest and file.
"These people enjoyed little follow up after the surrender," Sok said Leang of the Center for justice and reconciliation which organizes public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are soaked with a utopian agrarian ideology."
"They were high in a context in which to do business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now, life is hard because we must provide for our own needs."
The Khmer Rouge in progress also caused concern here.
The court would have to start next year, to start the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another Khmer Rouge former minister.
The mandate of the court is to judge the senior executives and the main perpetrators of crimes but it does not saying if it continued beyond these four cases.
It would take a few more to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation turned to Im Chaem, aged 64 years, the former chief district in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the rule of the Khmer Rouge in 1970 years.
In 2007, she said researchers of the Reference Library of Cambodia that she had supervised the construction of a dam Trapeang Thma, a project where thousands of forced labour would have died.
Recently, at a torrid night, Im Chaem returned from work in the area located near his house in wooden to pile on a dirt track outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun has cast long shadows on desiccated grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past under the Khmer Rouge.
If the court convened, she said, it would refuse to go there.
"Cambodia east peace and stability," said for it.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who made the defection of the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also warned repeatedly that instability would happen if the court prosecuted several suspects. although experts and historians dispute that.
"Cambodia to dig a hole and bury the past, he said.
But the past is that Cambodia must do to move forward, said Youk Chhang, the reference library.
"Reconciliation in Khmer is to reconnect the broken pieces, he said.
"We must put the pieces together so that we can understand."
The center produced the first manual approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, "a history of democratic Kampuchea, consisting of 75 pages."
It distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the textbooks history of the Education Ministry, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the nexus of the city to the regime.
Valeak touch, 19 year old student at the high school in Anlong Veng, said the new manual help students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he returned to the book to the house to study.
"My family has rejected many parts of the manual, and the court," he said.
"They are wary because they do not know exactly how many people the court will continue."
Such resistance the process of reconciliation complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
However, the Khmer Rouge preserve a atrait powerful.
In the golan the mountains of Dangrek, a way, invaded by weeds and strewn with plastic bags, led to a black soot rectangle, covered with a rusted sheet roof.
The body of Pol Pot was flaring here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea 31 year old saleswoman of cell phone in roadside, said that he did not know any more about the man who was incinerated at this place.
"But it has a great mind. and many people will demand, she said.
It was the anniversary of Nuom Sothea and, later that day, he planned to go to the place of rest of Pol Pot, where it would leave a ripe banana bouquet in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to abandon its uranium stock of quality military
The government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it would abandon its uranium stock of highly enriched, an essential element for nuclear weapons. this décison is part of a surprise victory of the campaign of president Obama to secure nuclear affairs worldwide
The agreement was revealed in a joint news release issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met the Belorusse here Foreign Minister, Sergei Martynov, on the fringes of a summit on security.
The US government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have freed the horizon last spring.
But us officials said Washington Post that some classified operations were conducted with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of uranium - quality from a research center of Belarus.
That opened the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the matter about 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcome of the Summit on Nuclear Security in 47 nations, held on the initiative of Obama. where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was advantageous to obtain an invitation to the Soviet ex-republic following the summit in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the Summit on Nuclear Security in 2012 Sommet nuclear security."
"It proves to me that this process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for global security, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear questions around the world in four years.
Since then, the six countries helped to get rid of all its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the Summit on nuclear security, Obama Belorusse president Alexander Lukashenko, said that the nation would never abandon its uranium.
"We kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the military uranium quality and leu," mr. Lukashenko said.
"It is our product... We will not make dirty bombs, and we will sell it to anyone."
"We will use it for research purposes, is all."
Belarus has approached the us a few months ago. however, by expressing interest in a deal.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus, in October, was particularly difficult because the material had been slightly irradiated, said officials.
It was blamed on a special train that traversed more than 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stored and eliminated, said officials.
The second operation was completed Monday and was executed by plane, according to officials.
The US government spent 13 million dollars in its efforts, mainly to replace the research facilities of Belarus with leu. misfit for weapons.
"A careful coordination and organization were implemented in order to strengthen confidence," thus leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, head of the department of energy specialist in reducing the Threat.
According to estimates by the Center for Study of Nonprolifération James Martin, Belarus had this year at least 88 pounds of uranium - quality, as well as hundreds of kilos of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its inventories by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States are tight for years, mainly because of harsh crackdown by Lukashenko of Human Rights.
But the statement Wednesday suggested a potential revival.
"All while being happy with progress on these issues of security, the us and Belarus acknowledged that increased respect for democracy and Human Rights in Belarus remained essential to improve bilateral relations. and essential to progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government did not issue any objection to flights of the CIA
The government did not issue any objection to flights of the CIA prisoners with Taliban and Al - Qaeda in Guantanamo direction through Spanish territory, according to a telegram of the ambassador from the United States in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents (filtered) cables by Wikileaks daily El País, which add that the first vice-president of the time, María Teresa Fernández De La Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed "pouvoir' to show that they exercised appropriate vigilance on foreign aircraft that crossed Spain."
In June of 2006, after a report by the Council Of Europe accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights in a dozen countries, including Spain, took a meeting between the former ambassador - Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández of Vega.
Vice - president acknowledged that the Council had "caught the off-side Zapatero" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"Vega stressed that Spain does not have an objection to flights of intelligence over Spanish territory."
"They want only to be told to" prevent "takes them to private," Aguirre in a cable reports.
The holder of the Ministry of External this time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, announced the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case profiles the lowest possible, even if, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had the ability of limited influence."
In turn, to January of 2007, prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he was not going to block the initiative of the judge to ask the declassification of documents from the Center of National Intelligence (CNI) and the Defense ministry on flights of the CIA.
"These reports contain any accusers element, no sensitive information," explained the Embassy after having spoken with the prosecutor.
The United States has yet their concern for "apparent coordination between Spanish judge and German prosecutors" more than déclassifiée information of CNI O of the Defense ministry.
"This coordination between independent investigators will make our efforts to operate discreetly case between Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March of 2007 during a lunch between the ambassador and the Internal minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, it commented that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of independence and will do what they consider appropriate," it had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid the comments of an inflamed rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature."
The ambassador also expressed his concern for the action of PP in this case.
"Despite his pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly benefit from any indication that the Zapatero Government tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States who could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the United States Government," she says.
The parricide who moved to the consents felt sorry for the network of "overwhelming pressure."

Members of the Popular Party would win 4 seats in Congress and the SGP'S would lose 9
The results of the 18-N, PP could be decisive in municipes of Tarragona, Lérida and Barcelona.
After the large increase in votes and deputies recorded in the last election, autonomic PP Catalan already targeted at general, because, even if there is progress or not, the outlook is more positive, because the number of votes that this formation gets in these comices normally doubles that it receives in Catalan women.
Thus, the popular Catalans won 610,473 votes in general 2008, while with autonomic of 2006, they had won 316,222 of them.
Spent Sunday, PC received 384,091 votes.
If he keeps this trend, ascending an unwanted diversion of votes the SGP'S and consumer loyalty of the electorate PP, analysts this training calculated that, if there would be general election, the PC has increased from 8 to 12 meps in Congress, while CiU would win them also four (he is now 10) and SGP'S would lose some neither more nor less than 9 mps (he has 25).
These would calculate that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of popular ERC would lose an mp - he has three of them now - while ICV would keep a deputy or we would win.
But if the electoral agenda is maintained next appointment would take place in May of 2011 for municipal comices, where popular ones can also be decisive in the late socialist hegemony in four provincial capitals and their relay at the General Advice of Barcelona, one of the bureaucracies that handles the higher budget of 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and popular ones is agreement with the SGP'S could lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not get the majority either the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Considering the republican, it would be far-fetched that this training loses its representation in the town hall in Barcelona - it is necessary to get the 5% votes.
PP increased its number of votes in four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be protagonists of the fall in the capital city of Tarragona, where they controlled with PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP recorded only one difference in 500 votes compared to SGP'S, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintain good relations with Mariano Rajoy, during the last campaign, they found several times.
Popular ones recorded progress in other municipes important as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now, PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalogne and aspires to form lists a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports with al
Except for the seven prisoners in Barcelona, Thailand, there were three.
Seven pakistanis and a native of Niger held by agents of the police station of Information from Police Barcelona formed a jihadist cell, headed for Thailand, facilitated passports with different groups - between, "Tigers for the Release of the Tamilian Earth" (LTTE) and "Laskar E Taiba (Let), the latest being the perpetrator of the attacks in Mumbai that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal gave a great importance to the inquiry, to assure itself that with "Kampai operation" was debilitated" the apparatus of forgery of al - qaeda at international level and therefore its ability" operative.
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which he was active in Catalonia, sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrated criminal galaxy - so that its "combatants" can pass europe's borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is only jihadist network operative held in Europe, so the investigations took part, except for the people of Thailand, other European police units, which is why the territory of the European Union, there could be the next days of blows similar to that recorded the night Tuesday spent to Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation -one held pakistan's Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Saddique Mohammad Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and native of Niger Babatunde Agunbiade), Thailand unrolled one another, with the capture of pakistan's Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They visits those who ruled from Bangkok the cell in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - including a role was struck in 2009, stole mostly tourists the passports that satisfied the conditions marked by named the "Islamic World Before."
The be-with saying the documents were to name former young men between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without visa stamped.
The investigators point out that until now we did not find any detail that apparent prisoners in Catalonia for the attack on Mumbai, even though the author of this attack, "Laskar E Taiba," was one of the groups receiving a stolen passports in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
But it should be noted that a few days before the attack is made of Catalonia one sent through an agency transfer some miles of dollars "invested" to buy cards in mobiles that were later used by the integral of "commando" who killed 106 people.
Police seized an abundant documentation.
PP needs of Mas that it suspend tax complicity
The leader of PC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to expose personally to Artur Mas his conditions to support his appointment as president of Generalitat, similar to those exposed during the campaign and are summarized to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of adventures philosophy-souverainistes as is economic complicity that the nationalist leader wants to approach half of his term.
The president of the popular Catalans to go with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having received 18 mps with elections Sunday, spent a number than enough to be made because, as the candidate of CiU requires that at least one training qu will exercise the opposition abstains from voting in the appointment.
On a possible deal with PP future alliances depend that the nationalists want to keep in Congress during the general election, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are done in Catalan key.
And with the PP, to support an appointment "it would be necessary to eliminate all speeches souverainists and freedom fighters," and economic complicity - similar to the Pays Basque - that convergent leader wants to subject itself to the referendum.
Both leaders have in common their bet to lose weight political apparatus a very exaggerated autonomic administration and the elimination of tax applied to successions and donations.
Details of the negotiations on the appointment of Farmhouse will be occupied by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Farmhouse already met with Joaquim Nadal (SGP'S) - promising a tough opposition, Joan, Herrera (ICV) and now it will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric one argues that the deaths were not due to "lack of action"
Owners of the center of Olot does not eliminate the possibility that their male nurse at night killed more than 11 elderly
Officials of geriatric Caritat d' Olot (Gérone) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the injuries caused by the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the male nurse who killed at least eleven elderly for which he was responsible in the meantime it worked.
The director of the residence, Joan Salted, presented himself accompanied by a lawyer with the center, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of Caritat would be that being able to exert the charge against the person responsible" for the deaths but "law and accountability force us to take processual situation of civilian officials."
And except for social discreditation that entity can suffer not have detected in the criminal activities of the male nurse at night, the major threat to Caritat now takes the form of a large compensation that legal representatives of the relatives of the victims calculate already.
Joan Vila Dilmé declared that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from this day he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of a geriatric care - he suspected that in many cases no doctor been exploring the deceased, personally but, given the age and pathologies of patients, the formality took place by telephone.
Caritat, through its director, categorically denied yesterday that situation and mentioned that "the lack of measures may have been in no time the cause of what happened."
The lawyer of Caritat added that "in this case there is only one index of imprudence on the part of any person that is not the accused."
Already dubbed person as the "Angel of Death" declared 11 killings day before yesterday and detailed that he committed the crime on August 29th, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case it caused death to him by injecting an insulin sober-amount, with difference of the first crime he had committed a mix of pastilles sedatives.
The director of Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control access to the staff of the center for medicines.
The insulin injections and cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that male nurse, in his desire to alleviate the suffering of internal used to kill them.
But analysis of laboratory will clarify if Villa does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victim a death less cruel or opposing he burned them inside by giving them detergent as he has already confessed that he made with the three women that he killed in the meantime October 12th-17th.
Caritat does not believe the claims of the male nurse at night, either the number of killings confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number is higher and justify their behavior by the various versions that Vila gave in his visits to the County Court and the lack of logic in change in the way successfully of killing having made eight killings.
So they claim that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clear up the facts.
ECB threatens
Investors have reacts abruptly yesterday to the threat of yesterday of Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate the ability of reaction."
The differentials the peripherals closed with force and the actions of the european banks have more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the ability of ECB to be wrong and the euro barely registered an increment, which is concerned signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market in the same way that it collapses, it is recovered, but motivated by end of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be long in losing fear.
A month ago, ECB cited us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and those who remain.
The Bundesbank demanded the finalization of the plan to buy government debt because of its inefficiency and the elimination of extraordinary measures of liquidity in the long - term, leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis let us hope that prolongs current measures of liquidity "at least until March," maintains the quarterly auction for unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We hope that we will continue with the program of buying bonds and gives the signal to intensify.
If they do not meet the generated expectancies, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity that God help us!
As during their meeting May in which they said that they had not even considered buying bonds and collapsé markets, history could be repeated tomorrow.
ECB must be believable and persistent.
In May he announced a bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said that he had already bought, provoking a new collapse on the market.
Yesterday the bidding of drafts a year in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28% million to 750 million in the 4.81% bidding earlier.
Even so, the kinds in Portugal declined by 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after trichet's words.
In Ireland we published the numbers of the hole and Allied irish Bank.
The figures represent 10,000 estimative short-term and 15,000 million potential and they have time to get private capital until February or they will be nationalized.
Even if Ireland does not have any credibility after not having detected the problem in July with the test of stress, the numbers are assumables in the Plan for Aid and help reduce uncertainty.
However, every next Tuesday, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not have enough support, as Ireland remains in a cradle of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderate the tone of his speech to release the tension before next Sommet of Heads Of State And Government on December 14th that it is necessary to find a political compromise that shows that we are a union and interpret all the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of the anthem of the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the president had an opportunity to presenting yesterday the plan that the Council Of Ministers will endorse Friday.
Reform pensions, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, deregulation, privatization, to reactivate jobs ring with hearing investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The dual effect Trichet and ZP explain the fact that the Spanish Stock Market suffered 4.5%, double the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
The difference in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain were quick and radical and we enjoy the effect surprised.
Now there is a bidding-key an obligation to three years will be enjoyed by effect Trichet, so we hope that this one is solved with strong demand and helps dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
For Spain to ask for a Plan would be an auto -- immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available, triple compared to March, with expensive types and they cut access to markets sine die.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be the wife of Caesar, "except for being, appearing."
Courage, we can leave ourselves there!
President Eulen d' will challenge the council Vega Sicilia asked by his sons
The storm does not stop the conflict open in the center of Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will challenge, because he considers it "no right," the legal adviser of El Enebro the next 16, demanded by five of his seven sons where they will try to propose their majority and to seize the bodies of management of the titular firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons David and Jesús María José give their legal vehicles for new chapter of litigation for control of the group.
The founder of the larger the services business for companies does not seem to be willing to cede the litigation to be present in managements of El Enebro.
From its board it was excluded by five of his seven sons who appointed administrators in the assembly of shareholders January 18th this year, the challenge is registered with the Company and Trade Register.
The legal adviser of El Enebro for the next 16, summoned by the Magistrate Number 2 in Madrid, again opened the box of thunders in the Álvarez family.
Recourse to the judge to set the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guaranteed the convocation of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo Emilio, Marta, and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is trained by David Álvarez as a "desperate use of applicants his five sons to test through a processual quibble with defrauding the Law clearly and misusing the right, validate and correct the radically zero assembly on January 18th," according to his official spokespersons.
That argument will be the basis that, once the assembly takes place, is disputed by given that it is "game changing."
The same protagonists, who maintained a discreet silence, already tried unsuccessfully that the magistrate an assembly convenes in June.
In El Enebro, a patrimonial and titular company Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among others, the sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group services requests but usufruct about 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
The case is the basic problem is that the judge must decide after the hearing on the request contest for which there is not yet an announced date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon over Siemens
Software creates improvements on cars in real - time.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe speed was marked by surprise and success.
In a moment, nobody in the options of a new stable, which had just happened, despite the ascending trajectory of the recent seasons, past November, in the last phase of the championship they bet everything on the triumph of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the skill as pilot of the German champion Sebastien Vette, either the ability of Renault engine that propels her car in the world of Formula 1 talking about the legend of "secret weapon" that multinational company Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful software of simulation of the process that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with targets very far away from the automobilistic high-level competition.
Appointed PLM, this powerful software tool was used to create assembly lines of factories producers of everyone, positions of power, instruments of utmost precision.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or the process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable failings and costs.
PLM facilitated the cameras with Canon, the Sukhoi aircraft or most famous commercial vehicles from Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, explains the fact that the use of such software tool in its factory in Formula 1, admitted Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real - time," the changes, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains why the stables of 1992 had an average of 10 engineers in their teams who was able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles each season.
The team Red Bull 180 young professionals high qualification working today who, with powerful computer equipment and analyze project any kind of changes on the runaway cars.
The leader of explained that Siemens PLM software is able to analyze and all elements of runaway cars Red Bull except the engine, which is exclusive responsibility for Renault.
One modifies materials, fuel, aerodynamics and members security.
The changes can shift from the virtual reality simulator the reality in less than 12 midnight, thanks to advanced systems of production by laser and autoclaves high-tech.
As one limitation of this folly of technological improvement there is the amount of 40 million dollars each team of Formula 1 can spend like limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull established plant of high - technology to create and produce its runaway cars in a locality with 50 miles of London.
They are two buildings where the visits, especially for journalists are restricted.
Everything that happens there are considered "secret signal."
Staff for this duty is up to 580 people, Ci-included two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Formula 1 Red Bull, perhaps, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
The huge technological resources that the energy drink brand has met with the services of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is priceless and zero well - known.
The director of the plant, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago you could argue that progress of R+D in the case of runaway runaway cars brought the 50% victories and pilots were also responsible.
Now these percentages changed and technology accounts for 85% of success, while the pilots provide 15% of the value.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber will never be replaced by computer, because "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP will install two Twenties own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened in Barcelona his first exclusive store in collaboration with its associate Pont Reyes.
It will be the first network of 20 trade between 80 and 100 square meters that multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will enter the initiative with the 16 areas already present in centers multimarque as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice - president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example, altered store located on Gran Vía of Barcelona, property Bridge Reyes, with which it has been 30 years since it collaborates.
American group prepared a plan to build 200 retail outlets of mark in Europe in 2013, strategy that includes 20 Spanish settlements.
Open first were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) the past week, Barcelona is the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, although she confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The head of HM personal systems ensured that philosophy for the establishment of the stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
American group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture stores (with products that can be hit in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold a similar image.
Moreover, HP covers staff training settlements.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a system of frankness and stressed that the exclusive network of trade claims "to improve the service to customers and PMEs in the purchase, aid, post-sale and packaging."
The store of Barcelona includes a space program with a pioneer controls on global level that solves the problems of computer equipment HP in guarantee.
An on-line service with apparent technical center located in Maastricht (Holland).
"For 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is designed especially for MPEs and users, because big companies contracted services for technical assistance already," Helena Herrero noticed yesterday.
Sabadell bets on "stealing" a million customers to rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the managing director of Sabadell Bank Value, I like Guardiola, think 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejecting a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war record.
Despite that, he plans a collapse in the margins of interest, which we will try to offset partially by increments of commissions and price of credit.
Sabadell wait to collect three years a million customers, including his task ahead.
Sabadell found a way to be exploited for three future years and to survive so in a very difficult economic environment.
The bank will start in 2011 a new master line that will hold one goes three years lability.
The goal, except for surviving without need for using government subsidies of FROB is to win a dimension of market by collecting a million new customers - including 700,000 if one deduces that can leave the bank, a big task ahead, because so far the bank has spoiled more PMEs and companies that particular client.
This year it raised 250,000 customers, including 50,000 companies.
His dimension to individuals is 3.5%, while in the companies it exceeds 10%.
Another base of the 2011-2013 is a bet on productivity, or is the same thing, austerity, with cost cuts as target, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when he has the results for the period ended.
Few banks now dare to lay down to goals and public, because the financial crisis disrupted all plans of global banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its master line Optima, establishes there is four years old, although originally the plan was for three years, but the market is determined its continuation for an exercise more.
Customers who let escape the savings banks will be his main objective.
During a breakfast organised by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a difficult year "and transcendental."
The executive, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create work stations," which is fundamental for the survival of the banking business, insisted it.
And even if he thinks the liabilities - which penalizes the margins - is reduced, the price of risk premiums that banks and cases pay for its emissions to get liquidity move already at the cost of credit to compensate for falling margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a factor pressure on the rating."
"We did not reach tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto already gave orders to its network to reduce the long-term credit and increase the price differentials - to see the CincoDías,November 22nd and 27th.
He also confessed that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase the fees," but "there is a competitive framework."
The master line of Sabadell is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that it ensures that in Spain "will demand greater dimensions."
"All will move next year," he assured.
He says that capital requirements "greatly increased" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And it mentions that the FROB can in replacing market in collecting new fund recapitalisations.
Having ensured that Sabadell can survive the temporal fence, he reduced the importance that some bank predicts that as a new crisis liquidity.
It says that you can emit, but unlike what happened in June, we can get short-term funding through rest, attenuates the crisis.
ECSC rejected the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the cases
The chief executive officer of ECSC, Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and insisted again on the speed with which the restructuring of the industry is conducted.
When the trial concentration of Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that ensured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the managing director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (ECSC), Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think that most mergers was executed, we can say that the incorporation of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica is a second phase, they are adjustments."
"Most were executed completion. it is possible that instead of the 17 it goes to 13 or 14, but all great processes were already conducted under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which collaborated in this operation as" the leader stressed.
In statements during a breakfast Association and Executives Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta said that the process of concentration is executed "more possible high speed and we must be very happy with how it is done within deadlines that fixed in the past, not now, business plans with the Bank of Spain," he emphatisé.
"The passage of 45 cases with an average of 28,500 million volumes of assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a trial without equal in history, reducing the number of entities by 62%, so that they are much bigger to be in conformity with Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a series of opinions rather not very happy about slow process," which shows a "lack of serosity and," because "what the Bank of Spain made is to recall that we must respect before the end of the year."
The chief executive officer of ECSC, Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, secured yesterday that Spain has the most stringent financial system of Europe and "likely" and he attributed to people who question it a "lack of knowledge."
The leader mentioned that given the current economic times, "we remain very quiet" the financial entities and savings banks, a system that started a "very important" process of concentration and "runs at the higher speed."
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector it is drawn from the stress tests that ECB achieved in July.
Zapatero and the German red lines
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but he has established the conditions for all.
Tensions markets caused a doble government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, which vary tax cuts for PMEs, regulation of private agencies or institutionalization suppression of 426 euros to help the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatisation of the 49% AENA, the management of Barajas airport and El Prat and 30% Lotteries.
Another, Elena Salgado vice - president with the backing of former president Felipe González, links herself with criticism of chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How these movements should be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that the position of Merkel is not a mistake in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And Germany has a radically new vision of what should be its future shocks, with maintaining the old traditions of the majority of its partners.
In European resistance, Germany, one starts to speculate about the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among others, and the south would abandon the currency area.
Second, the recovery of the Mark, though now it seems science fiction, with a very favorable trend of public opinion, close to one 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, discipline, fines with countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payment of one of them and extension to the private sector costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and that has long that it is defined, so far it does not have a place for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them starting from 2016.
That was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought it was to fly (fiscal rigor and stability of public finances) and its European partners, Ci-includes France, practiced.
The second blow of the country center-European was when Merkel prolonged the decision with difficulty to save Greece.
As of this time he was the subject of a fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and were published on the rescue of Greece.
Finally, around the end of October, Merkel expressed a clear position again, while demanding reforms it treaties Union to make possible the rescue of a country and forcing both to private lenders to support a share of the cost.
That position was interpreted as anti-European because it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although some watered-down, was approved, and the months following, is expected to attend the reform process of the Union is possible these measures starting from 2013.
Germany traced a red line that she does not think crossing.
And she tells us with all that, even though now we must take measures with which one may not too much, starting from the date the old workings of the euro would have finished.
2013 will mean the birth of a new currency area, in which countries that transgress the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to put in default and, in this case, the private sector will support a party of the costs.
Germany says that we should follow a path of growth with high rates of saving and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and trade balances positive.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, who chaired the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
The ante is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just a matter of renewing public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we demand is much harder.
And what should not absolutely do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence let happen to us a larger peace.
And you can seize the opportunity that gave us until the spring of 2013.
It appears that president Zapatero also heard that this form and his double declaration (reforming them Saturday promised after the meeting of the past with big business and the announcement yesterday of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, opened the way for the claim that it is necessary to bring order to the house.
But the red line that Germany is traced, and they do not seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that one sees, one can not exclude that to abandon a region too full of not very serious country.
And in this case, Germany, we will be able to argue that she had informed us.
Sport and fraud law
The trick similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show ingenuity but not to escape a sanction.
The expulsion warped in principle by two players Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match November 23rd against Ajax in the League Champions have run much ink on the character anti-sportsman such behavior and if both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As it is known, a few minutes before finishing the game (that their team have already won clear), the two players deliberately lost time when they have faults to determine the referee to show them the second yellow paperboard.
Thus, and given Real Madrid will end up being a leader of the group, both players will achieve regulatory sanction for the nearest game of the match dam against Auxerre and will be able to pass without paperboards to the next phase.
Finally, the discipline of UEFA punished with two games the coach of the team, José Mourinho and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow paperboard in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, if not quite is in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it makes party ethos, the rules not-written, but followed, the sport.
Part of the debate came in the reported cases to the fact that this was as protagonist a team of entity Real Madrid (which in his anthem posts the nobility and honor and in recent times condemned to a fine his players for similar actions) and orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds an episode in addition to its dilated history of thespian and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate asks whether this kind of behavior not expressly prohibited by the rules contradicts the principles of sport, i.e, with these actions is a fraud of law. because, indeed, they are respectful actions with the sporting regulations, but seems to elude his direction.
The issue is to examine the damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the goods that includes sporting spirit is the physical integrity of adverse players, one aspect that these actions were not endangers, i.e, he did not have violent play.
Another of those goods that it refers to the correct game is to prevent team of players offenders benefits from an unfair way the team, which is not the case.
However, the paradoxical action of the players Real Madrid is that it does not adapt so that characterizes normally like cheating O defrauds law, because its violation of the rules was not executed some seals to try to avoid sanctions, but their action precisely tried to be most obvious way to receive criminalization of the referee.
They expected and they accepted the sanction happily.
Another issue is the kind of advantage that offenders get the examined disposed faults.
Here it seems necessary to note that we do not put in a situation of inconvenience to the rival and you do not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action implies the fact of leaving their own team with players.
And it is not a useful strategy for the next match, either because the club could not rely on these players.
Obviously the advantage is that the players will begin the next phase of the League Champions without paperboards that can threaten their participation in a match.
But that is a long-term advantage with a degree of indetermination, because staff could be eliminated and suddenly except that, with this action players achieve a match of sanctions and go to the second round of paperboards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of paperboards happens with one less than in the first round.
So, to rise to levels, it is not so clear that is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are contrary to the sporting spirit, but some decision-making forms strategic which supports the benefit to the limit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not actuate to avoid implementing sanctions (which would be a clear case of fraud law), m otherwise instead chose the moment in which they were subjected to it.
They made a strategic decision without thwarting the penalty or to flee one.
Although the border between genius and fraud law is diffuse, this occasion I think it was a clear case of genius.
The controversy seems to me, is because of two factors: because there were two auto -- evictions and because of the way of transmitting the director to lead them.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not ethical as much as esthetics.
Offensive to capture the Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the agenda focuses this year an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like touron and the lottery, when December comes to the dinner party of groups before Christmas which continue to be the oxygen cylinder for restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but because of the crisis to emerge in an offensive you adjust prices to be able to reap the majority client. almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meal, coincide businessmen and associations in the sector interviewed.
To complete to make accounting, the timing of this year (night of New Year's Eve fall Friday) focused requests in the week of December 13th, as results so far an avalanche of reservations of dinners for peak days (17 and 17) and almost no previous week.
Since 2008, the difficult times, there are many firms that eliminated the collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many workers to organize by paying their own pockets.
Any economic situation, they ask all the prices of battle, confirms president Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
A representative of employers' now, does not dare to predict how will the festivals this month.
"People reflects much before reserving."
"They want to leave but they pay much attention to the price," he mentions.
The case will go well "for those who deliver quality at handsome and with a good service," he adds, recalls that customers have a tendency to descend a level with the crisis, so that section at around 25 euros became majority in demand.
In a poll in various settlements center one notes the collapse of demands for the night of 17.
The Soteras group indicates that there is a genuine boom for this vendredi-là, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, they responded by adapt their menus to the economic situation, complete with formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of powerful, Andilana, with 16 settlements in the city (Hostal of Rita, Market based and others), the hallmark of timing meant more anticipated reservations, even at the beginning of November.
"We made the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
Grup YEAR, which includes El Mussol, Attic, and QuQu total of 23 buildings, is to stay optimistic after detected a rise of invoicing since the second half of the year and good, though concentrated, liberating business for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that 18 will also be a hyperactive day on the level of groups of friends who celebrate in advance of the festivals.
Their six menus of group they added for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as famous and perception of a predisposition to spend a 10% more than last year instead of asking for more details, like the Catalan wine manufactured according to the Champagne method - "undermined."
They see the first signs of improvement in some societies inviting workers again and the sense that the volume of groups increased slightly.
On the part of employers Fecasarm (which includes entities like the Combination of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), his vice-president, Enric Gomà, entrust the possibility of starting to see the tunnel and that overall the reservations "lively" even if customers "negotiate to the maximum."
That is true, the hope for the festivities did not fall, indifferently which pays, he indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad has produced the atomic weapons in "faster pace than it does not matter that another country."
Filtrations of Wikileaks confirms connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the us embassy in Pakistan and the State Department of the United States filtered by Wikileaks gate confirm huge concerns that causes in Washington the Pakistani nuclear program.
Except for lighting and tasty that provide details on the content of the conversations and thoughts of american diplomatic officials accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security, instead of rising, "decline" and unstable produced Asian country of nuclear weapons "at pace faster than any other country in the world."
The hallmark of pakistan's nuclear program, the fact that the weapons are assembled, but they are stored by components to make difficult their destruction in the event of attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
So the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, enumerates in a report before the visit of former adviser to National Security, James Jones. "Proximity of some nuclear facilities of the territory under attack Taliban, the dispersal of nuclear materials, whose noise runs and vulnerability of transport atomic materials."
A large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is judged not only by the United States, but also by Russia, like proliferating and a reason to keep the guardian.
"Pakistan has to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities. given the educational and cultural levels, the extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who works in nuclear programs or missiles," the expert said Yuri Korolev, the Ministry of External Russian during a meeting with his us counterparts.
The new one documentation filtered through the gate of Julian Assange is cooperation whenever smaller between the United States and Pakistan, nuclear proliferation and the Pakistani high degree of production of nuclear armed.
A dispatch from the Embassy in May, which calls as "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, supports what follows: "Transparency is frequently absent. the offers of assistance remain unanswered or were eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, civil servants of National Intelligence for south Asia, note that "despite the economic catastrophe produced Pakistan's nuclear weapons at a pace faster than any other country in the world."
The ambassadress Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit to the head of the Army, general Ashfaq Kayani, he makes understand "very clear" with the head that "the Army of Pakistan must end with the tacit support to terrorist groups."
The chase chief of Wikileaks
Obama will number with a senior official for the anti-terrorist fight to avoid the new infiltrations.
Interpol emits a Red Alert to follow the movements and locate in Assange.
All aspects linked to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have a certainty on the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "Red Alert" to locate and follow the movements of" Assange.
Nevertheless, this is not a traditional order arrest.
Moreover, this one is not new, if not date of November 20th.
And it does nothing to even past filtration more than a quarter million of diplomatic documents from the United States but with accusations of sexual abuse that Australian it faces in Sweden.
Moreover, the creative lawyer of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, ensures that "police know where and how to contact Mr Assange."
The 20 bodies international police officer with the headquarters in Lyon (France), dictated the order in demand for Sweden, but it did not publicly until yesterday, having received permission from the authorities.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol received an indication to identify or locate Assange to "get its provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol can not give the order arrest of an affected individual by a Red Alert, many among member countries, according to the explanations of the organization, consider the appeal red see a free track for the arrest --the national body of the police, must realize, especially if they have a bilateral extradition, as is the case of Sweden and Britain, where it is thought Assange is.
The movement outraged with the lawyers Assange, who yesterday published a letter dénonceant the fact that the founder of Wikileaks, 39, shown himself willing to respond by videoconference with issues of the Swedish authorities.
They also remind that Assange demanded and got the license to leave Sweden the prosecutor in his case, this one from famous Pavlovich Lavrentiy Beria, head of the security of Stalin.
"It seems to be a hunt, not a judicial persecution," denounces the missive.
As the world seeks it - and in Australia with his mother defends the innocence of her son -- Assange continues to be an unknown place, but it is not keep silent.
Monday he gave as an open-ended place an interview to the director of the review through Skype, a conversation in which he demanded the resignation of the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If you can demonstrate that it was responsible for ordering American graduates that they spy on to the un by violating international treaties that the us signed, he should resign," he says.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary for the White House, Robert Gibbs, who qualified as "ridiculous and absurd" demand for resignation.
"I am not at all sure why the opinion of a kind with a Web page to interest us," he said on CNN.
Obama himself charged a senior official with the anti-terror fight, Rusell Through, preventing new leaks of documents.
The test of the spokesman for president Barack Obama to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators claim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who starting from January will chair the Committee of National Security in the Lower House asked the State Department to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate his funds and continue to anyone who provides them contributions or assistance."
Still further Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian president Stephen Harper traveled, who has to rethink his statements after having said that Assange will have to be killed."
"Obama should turn it into a goal and use an airplane without crew or something similar."
One person who did not ask for an apology was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, ex-governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"That is the Government that filtered information is guilty of treason and that is not an execution would be too pleasant punishment," he said on Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace with ERC winks to the followers of Carod
The republican leader will allow the party a secret voting on his continuity.
Huguet executive proposes a multi-polar and the end of the assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to resolve the umpteenth internal revolt within ERC, north because of the loss of 11 deputies and a half votes.
The party is aware that its threat of resignation is not enough for supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time, he knows that the influence of the sector is now so diluted as a liar, and that is absolutely give him headaches he had with other extinct account.
So the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with winks that allow him to be armored until municipal elections.
For starters, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 government advisers ERC will be able to come to a conclusion about its continuity in secret.
Through the ballot box, not by raising the hand.
If carodists want to convey a vote of criminalization to the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and tender his person.
In several interviews he said that he would not be considered not ratified half plus one vote, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, a result "with Bulgarian" would not be good.
People close to Carod demand with the president more than held his position at the disposal of the militance, a gesture that not be worth when Puigcercós controls the body, maxim between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to approve the executive a road map to May.
For that, they hope to participate in the development of strategic reorientation document that direction will be subject to the voting of the national council 18.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in return for the promise of the program to congress in the fall of 2011, the leaders see as a safe fact.
The leader of ERC declared that "polyphony" affects the stability and that his goal is to make once and for all the organization is able to wash its linen room in the family.
In this, the article that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog results symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be signed "in exchange for various targets" it is as if had been done.
And it enumerated five of them, it highlights two.
The first, "recompose" the executive to account for at least 90% of the militance, i.e, to include new figures that come from the industry follower of Carod.
The latter may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that liquid ERC for once and for all assembly as a mechanism of operation.
So, he defends reforms a statute that allows the achievement of congresses through delegates elected by vote.
Finally the model of assembly, an exception in the Spanish parties, was an obsession with the team Puigcercós, who fought in this direction in the past two congresses.
In fact, conclave of 2008 convulses he charged the direction of revising the model for assembly into a special congressional reforms status.
The meeting remains unfinished, because the internal tide of last years did not recommend to tackle this issue.
Now, without critical sectors with mounting, the time may be right to take it back and close it forever.

China maintains the goals to retard greenhouse gases
Representative in this country in the COP16 ensured that his country has made huge efforts to reduce coal trace and detailed that it keeps its offer to cut until 2020 between 40 and 45 pourcent its greenhouse gas emissions.
China maintains its offer to cut between 40 and 45 its gas emissions of greenhouse gases before 2020, secured Su Wei, representative of this country to COP16.

One recorded in all these areas, Ci-includes approval, last year, a new Law of Energy, which recognizes the goals moved toward reducing greenhouse gases, explained.
On the other hand, it stressed that in China, federal authorities worked in a coordinated government and local ones to achieve the goals of saving energy efficient use of energy and reducing emissions.

"It is an autonomous decision of the Order of Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to send himself, if necessary, by making a claim at the Order of the National Council, so it is a decision in the center of a competent authority," he noted.

Nava said Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections coming December 4th and 5th when we should elect a successor.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that never was on the negotiating table, at least for the moment, this was an approach for local elections that success and has achieved its goal," he mentioned.

When asked about criticism of PRI against president Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the priists to reflect over the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that governments of Zedillo Salinas there were better than Fox, Calderón. they begin to defend them. they leave 'cupboard," he said.
He said that the holder of the federal Executive branch can make expressions as he did in his speech to the National Audience, because in the country there is no muzzle, and fewer still censorship.
Obama promotes in Twitter law in favour of undocumented students
"If you are in agreement with the approval of the Dream Act, call kills senators and ask them to approve the legislation," Twitté the US president in the popular social network has.
President Barack Obama is meets today in the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize the undocumented students with a message in his own account of the Twitter social network.
"If you are in agreement with the approval of the Dream Act, call kills senators and ask them to approve the legislation," Twitté Obama.
His brief message maintains a cyber connection with a fuller document that requires public to contact senators immediately, because the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"A vote which hopes to soon now is the time to listen to your voice," he says.
The message was revealed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote for any legislation if the extension of cuts taxes for the Bush and funding the government is prolonged.
Such a blocking, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects like the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the republican blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said it is confidant that once the problem is resolved we will be able to set a agende for the rest of the projects.
"I think it is time..."
"We are all agreed that it is necessary to solve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a time, in this sense, then we will be able to plan the sequence moreover," has said.
The leader of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that he would ask for a "vote of debate closure" for the Dream Act, why the initiative to legalize the undocumented students could be passed starting from next Thursday in the Senate, even though most likely would be the next week.
The senate version of the Dream Act or the Law of the American Dream would legalize 800 thousand young people who came to the United States before age 16, they remained in the last five years and they were accepted by an institution of higher education or the Military.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, why they need the contest a large number of republicans, moments when organizations partisan of the protagonists intense lobbying to secure the approval of the Law.
Democrats, the majority supports the Dream Act, have 58 places.
But at least one of them, senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said that he would vote against and only one republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
So the Dream Act would require the votes of several republicans other democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courted republicans there are senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, the outgoing senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term " senator Mel Martínez.
Other republicans who supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they were not going to support him in another opportunity.
Another republican who supported it, John McCain, did not define his posture until now.
Although the House Of Representatives has a different version, analysts are agreed with the fact that the larger obstacles of Dream Act in the Senate.
The literatures put a finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures of the language was a walk in which participants flaunted the narration
"Sex in language I understand it, but... finger on the wound? what am ego hoped for? ," asked the writer asked Luisa Valenzuela has to open the second stage of the Pleasures of language, a cycle that celebrates the Spanish literature and then used the subtitle of his question (for another blond the roundtable was doomed to Sex in the language, explained).
Finger on the wound..." puts us in embarrassment," started slowly the argentine writer to the public, most young people who had gathered in the International Exhibition of the Book of Guadalajara (OVER) to listen to the table tempered by Marisol Shultz and who participated Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined later as a great story, Luisa first one as a protagonist who seeks knowledge that is the "wound" it goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same narrative wire.
The infectiologist it leaves convinced. "patience is not my fort, it is perhaps my injury."
At the end, after a frustrated approach to traumatologist who cut the winds in the corridor, but that explains why he wound is not a scientific term. it is the psychoanalyst that the mystery reveals. "the injury is what is actually open, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concludes. "the injury I could only know that it is actually open and it does not exist," but is convinced the fact that the pleasures and pitfalls of language must be very dependent between them.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez as exposed a charming narration as he called Éloge with the invention, where finger on the injury is not numbered but at a given time is found.
With key of magical realism, he speaks about a famous enchantress who hit clouds, return people who had gone away or repaired virtues that a damsel lost, a narration that America transfers to speak so great news that from the start his own chroniclers and cited in Bernal Díaz Del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of narrations of the capitans conquerors.
"Cervantes invented all of us (writers) is made fun of false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but a aitre way we would never have told the story of America with an imagination that lacked even decency."
Nevertheless, it, "they noted crazy and liars have the best fantasy" and that reality converges with the lie, we do not know any more that part of the narration part of a gang or another, where the literature of fiction reaches its peak.
One calls it the "tradition of Cervantes."
"It is thanks to its legacy that is what it is."
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the WIRE with its roundtable owes It to the injury.
Cuba's you have met him on his major injury of social violence that his country is experiencing, and Latin America shares - produced arguments adulterates and the sale of drugs.
"I think the good literature, good poetry good songs contain a tacit pledge that is not of course premeditated," he said, citing the reality of literature is communication and dimension of commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening is over with the intervention of Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who also noted "it must injury to the writer."
He saw that in a world which also lives in high speed and intellectual habits and control of consciences which turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every claim there is no small and behind every denial there is little yes."
"The Masters of our own feelings and to be the Masters of reality, we must temper. and moderate means much time to pose finger on the wound and disturb people who feel very convenient while thinking in caricature, white and black, established ideas and nuance and also disturb the powers who prefer a world in black and white," he said, while inviting to get the meaning to write.
Romano in the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finales he had ups and downs in his career, but he knew to three times the decisive set.
The duel from Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there is in two different styles which are marked by technicians, who find them a marked contrast with the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finales, he had ups and downs in his career, but he knew to three times the decisive set, although so far it has not put in the thousand and so the opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentine one ended up being comforted with the medal of under-champion, there remained a step behind winners and strangely with the same team he played for the subsequent finales.
The strategist santist reached his first final as a coach in the Tournament Opening 2002, when he held the reins of Morelia in which it lost a total of 4-2 against Toluca. later on, the Fence 2003 happened also decisive duel and again lost in the overall result of 3-1 and that was against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already in the Tournament, Bicentenary 2010, again against Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback, because his team has an equal match at 2-2 against Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but the series of penalties it got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to win the title and three of his players missed from 11 feet and suffered jump with the result 4-3.
Rubén lost two finales with Diablos Rojos and one in Monterrey, his rival for the tournament, so it does not have the same fate, he tries to be detached from the evil spell to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he says that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I do not want to break any statistics, for a club, not a passion that I have and I will win the title, but what I mentioned earlier is more important," quartermaster commented on when asked who would be his weaknesses in the finales.
He remembers the last end, he assures that he learned, "the lesson we can learn is that until the referee is not the final whistle, we can celebrate, we are prepared to the right, players also, because the last time, with two penalties to draw we have already prepared to run and I think that is a lesson before the end of the game we can celebrate."
He knows that this series would be defined by penalties, which does not care, because he entrusts its players. "One never seeks to achieve series of penalties, one tries to finish the regular time, but sometimes it is just us to prepare, the former tournament we were prepared, unfortunately fate made us a nasty joke, sometimes they are the emotions or distresses to hold the title in our hands, hands it has eluded us, that was helpful to us as a lesson for the final and we hope that does not happen any more in this situation."
Romano now has more opportunity to be a technician under-champion and taste for the first time the glory offered by the securities.

In any form, the creature uses the arsenic one as a way of living and this capacity makes us believe that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our volunteer atmosphere.
According to the astrobiologists, if these organizations use arsenic one in their metabolism, it turns out that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from what we know."

The tourist sites must be treated
The tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of foreign tourism because of poor conditions of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After fallen from a foreign tourist in a widening of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlán demanded the authorities that they pay attention to the zones and sites that are in bad conditions and project a bad image of the port.
El Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of traders of Dorada Shingles, reminded that they have repeatedly demanded that the image of the destination is treated and new activities to replace others that tourists find bad.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and pavements has affected because the tourists there have suddenly walked and they see the mess and avoid close trade.
"Politicians do not know how to close a company one day, and they do not know the fortune that loses, and they did not do the job for so long without adequate planning."
Hotel Manguart José Ramón Sánchez said that the fall in tourism has exposes the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Hall.
"Municipe will have to take responsibility and to prevent passes again, how to do it, so through preventive maintenance and to make the corrective measure," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist region must you keep it, but as people who deserve a clean place to live there and the Town Hall must change its strategy for maintaining the city."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, has said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, that does not depend only on promotion, it must have a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, ongoing maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They did not pay attention that it is necessary and such facts underscores something that is notorious for all, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlán is urgent because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that should be in line with the whole municipe and be a priority for the city to date, clean, orderly and it is attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán offers many sites and historic places and farming that you should order first, clean and us online to make them attractive to be able to add an inventory that we need to promote this destination."
IP requires results of the Congressional
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CEC, proposed that mps take great responsibility to be an example for better Sinaloa because of various provocations which confronts.
The case of Mazatlán demands a Legislature work worthy and free of agreements between the parties and the government Executive, Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Yesterday we installed the 60-è legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 deputies of the PRI, 13, three of the Party's New Alliance, two PRD, Pt, Convergencia and one of PVEM in total 40 representatives popular.
The list of expectancies that the new integral of the governing Congress is own and committed management at the company and various industries that need a responsible legislative work and the same models spirit of party or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CEC, proposed that mps take great responsibility to be an example for better Sinaloa because of various provocations which confronts.
"We hope that the mps really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to ensure their own interests and they are transformed into masquerade of carnival of governing and parliamentary fractions."
So I ask that they certify a commitment to build bridges to make governing current one to progress.
"We will ensure that they are a venerable work and especially committed to society and industries because people of Sinaloa gave them their confidence vote in the last election.
José Ramón Sánchez Manguart, president of the Association of Hotels, Islas, considered one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces seeking economic growth of the State, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"Most important is that they push economic growth, that they generate stimulations for investment and infrastructure, and in a way will stimulate generation of work stations."
With regard to the tourist activity, he asked that the new lawmakers to give him the importance that it is in the government's budget to consolidate the Secretariat of State Tourism.
"I realized that this is the second Secretariat of State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as economic activity and generating currencies and investment and rivals directly with agro-industry."
Except for the fact that it is necessary to classify resources with tourism projects detonators that help provide security for the State and to provide up to date the Law of Alcohol that the former legislatures could not solve.

The illegal migration will be able to continue without problem
The bill for the conservatives, which according to the government, should solve the problem of boats charged with illegal migrants, obviously will be defeated when the three opposition parties announced Wednesday that they could not support him.
"I am heavily rely on the Charter."
"I was standing with a party that created the granite under your feet," liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said, while he was surrounded by deputies after holding the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals argue that the bill, as proposed, would make it possible to hold up to one year anyone from a ship transporting identified as illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of rights and freedoms.
The head of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it is caught some at the wrong target.
"We are against, and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, then we will see what the government will do," mr. Duceppe said.
The critic of the NPD on immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected reverse of the critics wanting that his party is not tough enough about illegal immigrants.
"Néo-democrats are in agreement that it takes action against border runners clandestine and that is what we do through another bill, C-35," Mrs Chow said.
"We do not support the bill with the conservatives because it is caught some of the refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," explained Mrs Chow.
The Minister for Immigration, Jason Kenney, accused the opposition parties to play politics and to ignore the Canadians.
"The Canadians massively tell meps that they do not tolerate this type of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treating the country like a door mat."
"They expect Canada is taking tough measures," responded the Kenney minister.
The government did not announce a confidence vote on his bill, which could have led to elections additional clause his rejection.
A conservative but told QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that every mp who opposed then explains in his constituency.
The new unit does not meet the unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to ask for the creation of a public committee of inquiry on the subject.
The Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports this idea does not go back to yesterday. Quebec would have consulted Department of Investigation in New York on this topic by last January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement Tuesday in surprised more.
It should be said that at a meeting of permanent Council over the police service Quebec, on October 29th, this was never debated despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
We did not have any more for the critic pequist public safety, Stephan Bergeron, calls this the "rabbit out of a hat" and "solution arranged on the corner of a table."
The Dutil minister as he answered those who fear that political power has too much influence over possible future unity.
"You will see the results when we will announce it, is happy to say."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the CSQ, Réjean Relative, nothing can replace the setting-up of a public poll.
"Mr Charest is obstinated not want to create a committee of inquiry, plus people think like you and me that he has something to hide," explains.
"The only way to having a committee of inquiry, it is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains as he Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of public administration.
Out of this impasse, it suggests in Quebec giving a special office of the auditor general to inquires into collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the term of the auditor general," he slices.
It also estimates that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as a commissioner, thus enabling him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the paperboards of Charest government.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to alter the criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
That demand would come from the prosecutor of the Marteau operation, which informed the minister of Justice, Jean-Marc Fournier that jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, as he confirmed that his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, leans today on some amendments related to this file.
At the time of the operation Printemps 2001, which hit groups of motorcyclists, even if the criminal Code was not appropriate, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa later made the Law on gangsterism.

Dupont partly blames
Radio presenter of Quebec Stephan Dupont suffered a partial reverse in front of the Canadian Council standards of radiotelevision (CCNR) for controversial statements on social assistance and Haitians as on his crude language in waves.
The CCNR judges that Mr Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that some remarks contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representation of Haitians and crude language that is not appropriate for broadcast programming during the day."
The Council also concluded that a discussion about suicide, including the spread of the two people who had committed suicide, did not infringe codes on broadcasting.
The CCNR received several complaints about comments made during emissions broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from a Common Front of social assisted people in Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts cited in issuance were inaccurate.
The moderators to present solid rather than misleading information.
About suicide, the moderator Stephan Dupont had thought suicide was a gesture of coward.
The majority of the members of the Committee concluded that conveyed the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers the episodes blamed "Dupont midday" attacked a tricky subject in a fair and appropriate."
No blame was retained in its place.
The latest litigation related to statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stephan Dupont and Jean-Rene Dufort had then devoted themselves to a media face-to-face discussion that had caused many responses.
The moderator of CHOI said he had not made any donation to help Haitians because we can not know for sure that needy people would actually receive money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but their cumulative effect is an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I have purged my three day suspension on top."
"My file is virgin for a year and a half," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the spread of crude language.
In each case, broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation."
The consequences are tiny for the station which will, among other things, once announce these decisions during prime time within a period of three days.
A king of kung fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has a very particular course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" kung fu "high touch"), boxing and kickboxing Thai goes up on the tatamis and boxing rings around the world in search of new challenges.
"I began to practice martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in the metropolis to move since 2008 at professionals."
"In my case, I seek fighting everywhere, for those who do not like the game on the ground in mixed martial arts, the competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, works as a security agent and made for the UPS company issued precisely bad news for its rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Championship amateur World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from October 23rd to October 30th, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing, he explained."
"Now, I prepare to go to China for the World Cup san shou."
"The fighters who finished in the top four at the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, I concluded the tournament for the fifth - largest, when I came third in Toronto in 2009, he added.
"What is interesting is that I moved to each competition."
"At this rate, I will be the first time or next year!"
"San shou" or "sanda" is a discipline from China where the punches and foot, as projections on the ground are allowed.
The duels place in an original way on a platform and rarely in a boxing ring.
The most famous pugilist resulting from this form of combat is america's original Cung Vietnamese, recognized in the martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal to hold an event in his career, he will answer probably his presence the super tournament "King of Sanda," Super Bowl of kung fu.
"The competition is high and most prestigious in China, explained the strapping nice man."
"It is a bit equivalent of the Stage Lumpinee (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"Ç' was a super experience."
Zemmal won his first fight in semi-final in its category (80 kg), before eventually losing.
"That has defeated me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg and 85 kg and 90 kg and 90 kg).
"The winners of the semi-finals clash in their category."
"Second, the winners of each category face in order to crown a champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without invitations to tender
Hydro-Quebec granted private 450 million dollars in contracts to firms of engineering for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Teal-Rupert.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor who gained most important, the management of the project, for a sum of 295 million without invitation to tender.
The consortium called Énergie management was composed in 2004 in a concomitant way to the choice of Hydro-Quebec to entrust to the private sector its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of 5 billion dollars.
At the start of 2005, the consortium Énergie management received lucrative contract without there being public invitation to tender.
For Québécois Party, the use of consortia of businesses poses a serious ethical problem that risks to eliminate competition and lead to higher prices.
"It is the new way was collusion and shot competition."
"I.e, instead of doing that in a secret, now do it in an open way," said yesterday the deputy pequist Sylvain Simard in press conference.
Earlier in the morning, mr. Simard raised the issue at the National Assembly because he tells difficult to see how the public interest would be served in this way.
The Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in afternoon, vigorously denying that there was collusion for the contract.
"I started to have my journey," she has plague, supporting the PQ had been "dishonest" and had "lacked rigor."
She said that "it would be less worse" than the PQ is excused.
The formula of consortia is a common practice in the world.
It is usually about an alliance limited in time that two or several companies to gather their respective testimonies expert in order to respond to an invitation to tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project involves a high - level of complexity given the extent of work.
Construction site is underway and staggered until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the hands of competition act. there were negotiations.
Also, the formula of consortia is no longer an exception to Quebec, even for simple projects.
As last week revealed Duty, the formula of consortia in the genius-council is the subject of an investigation by the government.
Rapid overflight of the register of companies Quebec allows more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
So the Dessau firm works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Rock and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are tens, brings them to one, and even legal, is Dessau.
As for the consortium Energy management, Normandeau minister stressed that "the territory of the James Bay answers dynamic labor, and that Hydro-Quebec answers in a particular way since the 1970's."
The big boss of the Eastmain, Réal Laporte, the Company energy (James Bay SEBJ), gave an explanation that frown on the fact that the management agreement of the project was granted private.
"If you go to invitation to tender and there are few tenderers, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: maybe you have people who are in this market and that you say. we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a handsome price."
"The idea is that the price is important, it is the competence of people," mr. Laporte said.
The contract awarded to a consortium Énergie management belongs to a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 $ obtained by the Québécois Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for Eastmain-1-A-Teal-Rupert project.
After verifying the Duty were 109 contracts genius-council granted between 2002 and March 2010 at firms and their subsidiaries, including the laboratories of land.
SNC-Lavalin nicked 22 contracts, Génivar obtained from 16 Tecsult Dessau 14 and 10, living in poverty its participation in Énergie management.
All the contracts were negotiated.
They add up to 449,783,344 $, including contract with Énergie management of $ 295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard made it clear that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM) and Axor are "well with the Liberal Party of Quebec."
The Normandeau minister dropped that the PQ is also linked to these firms that "finance," before specifying that they were not his leadership.
Barometer of responsible consumption - "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Québécois consumer is very little confidence in the players of sustainable development, but also with the deal marks and certifications écologisantes to guide his choices.
Worse, even if she bathes in a media universe where messages in favour of a more responsible consumption pullulate, he laments a credible lack of information, it deprives even calls to drag his commitment, indicates the Barometer of the responsible consumption, whose first reading was issued yesterday.
Even if they increase socially responsible consumption of products said in 2010, the Inhabitants Of Quebec, however, seem to give little credit for those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them indeed, not believe the environmental commitment from companies like green advertizing companies, reveals a measuring instrument worked out by the Observatory consumption responsible for the Sherbrooke University.
Another report: half of consumers doubts the reliability of official certifications affixed on products known as fair, but also the credibility of the products and brands posting itself as écoresponsables, the Barometer indicates.
In the same vein, the rhetoric of politicians on this theme is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebec.
Information on responsible consumption is still crucial to stimulate this side of consumption is animated by nearly a third of the Québécois consumers.
Indeed, the gap and dubious character of information would calm the heats of 46% of consumers.
It is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after higher prices for these products.
In addition, a third of the Inhabitants Of Quebec is also said to be wary argued the performance of green products or services that it seeks to put them in the hands.
On another note, consumers were about half have 2010 changed their practices and changed by mark of one or more products to meet their conviction.
61%, They also supported with traders buying their district and privileged product purchase food grown in their region, the Barometer indicates.
Greening and responsible - the index responsible consumption reached 64 on a maximum of 100 this year, Gay, consumus the Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, which seeks to reduce its environmental footprint in frightening protection of animals.
But his social conscience and ecological appears however to stay outside his car, indicates the Barometer. in 2010, just 28% of Quebec said to have used public transport or recommended the car-pooling to defend their green interests.
Walk or bicycle were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this vast behavioral survey, which has just taken its first stereotype.
A loan of State for the purchase of eXcentris
The government of Quebec, which required to hire financially in the purchase of cinema complex eXcentris by Angus Society and the Parallel, agrees to work, but the amount of borrowing only.
The Company Angus development and Parallel, who hoped for a gift of seven million of the ministry of Culture to buy in Daniel Langlois the cinematographic complex eXcentris on St. Lawrence. boulevard by giving its full cinephilic vocation, do not get what they claimed.
The government agrees to be involved in the file, but in its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift, the government of Quebec has proposed a loan that amount would be below initial expectations in addition, which could be a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources of the dispensaries.
An action plan and a demand for 12.8 million already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but for summer have scaled down.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to the minister St-Pierre by the president of the society of cultural enterprises (SODEC), Francois Macerola, who runs the file eXcentris.
He forwarded her a final report ten days ago.
But the counter-proposal cabinet arrived at the SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have to answer until December 31st.
It seems that the assumption of the gift of the State must really be isolated.
Let us recall that the Combination of owners of cinemas and cinéparcs Quebec opposed a direct investment in the State to support the purchase of eXcentris, asserting that the ministry of Culture does not have to finance housing projects, which he did not do for other cinemas.
But several speakers of the medium - claimed on the contrary, a substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, master of the house, over the years won at arm's length films, author of the buildings in the complex having financed itself his construction, which could justify an exemption on the part of the Council of the treasure.
The lack of houses for independent films is shouting in Montreal, and eXcentris had known fidéliser its customers.
The Angus Society and the Parallel with their heads in Christian Yaccarini, control, on the other hand, a campaign financing to private, hoping to collect 700,000 $ to push the wheel of purchase.
Since spring 2009, one of three screens, the Parallel, continues to diffuse film with eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27th by showing a beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois men and the gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Duty and ignores what he and his group down thinks the proposals are made.
Lifted the veil on complexed Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables revealed by WikiLeaks lift the veil on what the United States regards as the inferiority complex of Canadians to Americans, but they betray both the sense of superiority of the latter to Canada.
So, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have the canado-American relations with the spirit while going to vote and believe that the visit of president Obama has helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009.
The four new communications between the us embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread over the public square yesterday, offer more crusty details that substantial content to put himself in the tooth.
A cable dated September 22nd, 2008, is federal campaign reports how the United States is not part of the challenges debated by politicians.
The great astonishingly of the us ambassador to post with Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations for this.
Perhaps an "almost inherent inferiority complex Canadian conditions the Canadian political leaders to speak about the challenges of everyday rather than to win this election on the us (as in the campaign to free trade 1988)," he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant in this election. ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about it."
The ambassador understands that as much less the "deafening silence" that the two countries have intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he estimates, the ability of a candidate, and more than one head of party to this crucial relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind, go to vote."
Other expression of this sense of importance is read in a cable sent on January 22nd, 2009 by Terry Breese, cio in Ottawa, preparing president Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government at the time of the vote of confidence at the beginning of February on the federal budget, in which Canada will post its first deficit in a decade because of a stimulus package of 30 to 40 billion dollars," writing m. Breese.
Nowhere is not mention that the government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to prevent being overthrown by coalition and opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the stimulus suggested.
Another communications, gone back to January 2008 and signed the ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington increasingly negative image that broadcast drama series with CBC return from the United States.
The ambassador is worried emissions Border, Little Mosque each Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which observes not very subtle references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or abduction for muscular interrogations by the CIA.
Another cable reports that, at the time of their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe were prepared to welcome some detainees at Guantánamo.
Mr Kouchner said yes, but on the basis of "individually."
At the end of the meeting, he has written, "he gave a paper to the Secretary of State over Omar Khadr, a 15 year old Muslim of Canadian."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Let us see, that the spirits warm up on the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser close to Stephen Harper, said the waves of CBC that the head of the mass escape "should be killed."
It was the echo of Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
The proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan for restoration of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries in order to get a greenhouse gas reduction (greenhouse gases) to one-third of the extra cuts that fits virtually should be done to stabilize global warming by 2020.
The ambitious plan is to tread of concrete major projects that the un hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding commitments to cut by industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs still monopolize from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by light fluocompactes or, better, by bulbs with light-emitting diodes (LED or "English LED"), the main part of the 1.8 billion tons (WP) greenhouse gases emitted on the planet to light humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from global car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, transmitting large countries like the us, China, Europe and others, including Canada, is engaged in a voluntary reduction plans should push the total emissions of greenhouse gases 53 WP 49 WP.
But it will be necessary to remove the balance still 5 WP to stabilize by 2020 the climate to 2 degrees centigrade in order to prevent it does not become out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of energy are dispelled in the form of heat and the rest, 5%, produced light.
In light fluocompactes, energy expense is reduced by 75% and the new bulbs and LED, it reduces the energy requirement twice.
The bulbs fluocompactes last on average from 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new bulbs and LED, like those that launched the manufacturer Philips this week, the company participated in addition under investigation - un, have a 25,000 hour life expectancy and consuming 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats, emitting little heat.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several scholars have displayed reserves to light fluocompactes because they contain mercury and that they should be eliminated as hazardous wastes, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers implement instructions.
But, the report indicates, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the bulb fluocompacte, but rather the thermo coal plants, which emit much mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these power stations emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the profits that each country through this global program would do.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion annually in purchases of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, is the equivalent of 3.5 thermo plants that construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast is expected in the nervousness the announcement of the election results
The un secretary - general, Ban Ki-moon, claimed the publication "without delay" the results of the presidential election in Ivory Coast, after the expiry of fixed periods.
"The secretary - general of the need for independent electoral commission for completing its work and for announcing the provisional results without more time, highlighted a spokesman for the head of the un."
"He asks all parts of the Ivory Coast and institutions to be evidence of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission to let the deadline of midnight Wednesday without publishing the results, three days after the election on Sunday.
About four minutes before the expiry of the period, president of the CIS had said on television that the commission "has continued to work" to announce the results.
The appeals multiplied Wednesday in the world for the CIS proclaims in the name of the winner of the second-round run-off between incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara opponent.
But the Gbagbo camp counts on forgiveness by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" vote in the north, held by ex-rebellion of the new Forces (FN) since the coup lacked September 2002.
Pascal Affi Guessan, campaign director of the president of the Ivory Coast, argued that the devices of voter intimidation practiced by the FN in the north of the country had dissuaded supporters of the incumbent to go to vote.
The election could be cancelled if the complaints lodged by Gbagbo are retained by the Constitutional Council.
But opponents of Gbagbo believe the high court in the country is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao DRE, a political ally close relationship with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, the man the North that belies any link with the ex-rebels, considered to be "unacceptable" the delay in the announcement of the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but it was not until asserting the victory.
His allies say that Gbagbo blocks the release of the results because he knows that he lost and to feel sorry for before the Constitutional Council, having avoided the electoral commission from distributing the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation in a country remained divided over two years.
The United Nations warned Wednesday the political class Ivory Coast that could be held accountable for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished atop the first round on October 31st, with 38% of the vote compared with 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who received the backing of former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).

Business Clotilde Reiss. the Elysée exaggerated the syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a French enquiring young decree in Iran for espionage," held opinion in life in France, put diplomacy in alarm, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All the attention look of diplomats from the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some lower parts of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy with the Americans, going until their giving advice for the treatment of their own crises "hostage" in Iran -a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of a young French had not had as a counterpart award in freedom of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian held in France and sought by us justice for material traffic for the benefit of iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they place under a raw light the way in which the French president sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, bashar, had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12th, 2009 in Paris is called "Iran. French comments about the way of dealing with cases of hostages."
The advisor to the Palace for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the head of the French Foreign Office for Middle East and North Africa, Patrice Paoli, discuss with us diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French approach.
They tell Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals selected force in Iran.
"Noise," they say, "constantly hammer" in the media the words "basic human rights," "innocence," "immediate liberation."
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more as Iranians ask you not to do it."
Because last attempts at talks by discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything," the Iranians are "Masters in delaying tacticses."
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest from abroad is a familiar tactic: Iranian the taking of hostages for political blackmail."
He says that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (who will come on August 16th, when she takes refuge in the embassy of France "will require payment for Iranians a large amount of money" (230 to 000 euros in guarantees).
And it states that the Elysée anticipates other crises of hostages, a phenomenon that will worsen."
The Iranians may "in the near future to stop another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
August 28th, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been coming out of prison for twelve days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is disseminated. iran's Majid Kakavand, whose us claims the extradition of an illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic materials to Iran, is determined in freedom to Paris on the decision of a judge.
The us embassy, as many observers, wonders about the troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks Iranian underground networks of purchases of equipment for its nuclear program, the enlargement of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France has a bargaining?
The Iranian against the French?
During a discussion with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4th, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he said, was "completely taken by surprise by the decision of the judge," but sought to oppose it.
"There were sharp exchanges between the French presidency and keeps it at the time seals," Michèle Alliot-Marie, but the French government can reconsider the legal decision," he observes.
Mr. Richier wants to also show as Majid Kakavand is placed under "narrow" monitoring of the French intelligence services.
The adviser to the Elysée composes a phone number, hangs up again, then informs us diplomat said iran's "is localized in buildings in Paris run by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare his efforts, through official statements and "leaks" in the media, believe that Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad has played important" and "influential" part "of "mediator."
Americans watching this activity not without irony, and note that manipulating a success for several news stories reflect the French official version.
A telegram dated August 25th, 2009 evokes "media blitz" of French official."
What both "expressed" gratitude to Mr Assad is based, ponders the embassy Paris.
"Despite their statements full of praises French official, admits privately that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians really done."
The document then leans on the reasons that pushed the Elysée to be paid in this fiction.
The intense effort of communication "aimed at validating the politics of Sarkozy opening in Syria," he analyzed.
A policy launched in 2008, which "had then been seen by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and unmerited."
"Exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris "seeks to show in Syria that praises it can attract himself by playing a constructive role in the region."
The goal is to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The American embassy is it good source.
On August 11th, Francois Richier entrusted to him. "of course, we do not know if the Syrians did nothing."
"But we thanked them nevertheless."
"It should at least sow confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss return to France on May 16th, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives in the Palace.
In an official statement, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria, for their "active role in the release of a compatriot."
Pas de online games for the young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law known as "Cinderella" who will banning teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, said government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask the companies online games to block access to these games after midnight, the young ages of less than 16 years, said representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
"Many children play these games all night and then difficult to study at the school and have a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is needed to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP in OJ, Rin ministerial head of the bill.
The online games will be available again at 6 o'clock in the morning.
Companies will be one year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government also plans to ask firms to limit the access to these games for young people whose parents make the request, added the head.
It also will make available to people who claim it freewares that make it possible to limit the amount of time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the "connected" and newspapers regularly bring news in brief to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world competitions of online games.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals in World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
The 2018-2022. the Fifa indicates the organizing countries
A storm because of suspicions of corruption, the executive committee of Fifa Thursday indicates the organizing of the World Cups of 2018 and 2022, an eminently political choice where power struggles and lobbying are likely to take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the competition queen of the Fifa will take place in Europe, a bastion of traditional discipline (4 candidates. England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Country-Low-Belgium).
2022 Will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territory (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of figures part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Jose Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, heads of government Belgian and Dutch, Zidane and Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of economic issues and policies.
The behind-the-scenes negotiations are likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, difficult to establish hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the assessment report of Fifa, the English records, hispano-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments that their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavy for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the revelations have led to the suspension of corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu, could have been so ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that hosted the World we only once, in 1966.
The BBC gave it a layer, Monday by broadcasting documentary that pins three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to dissatisfy the Fifa and the embarrassment british officials, who embarked on an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the first line.
The head of the government hopes to republish the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who won in 2005 for London organization of JO-2012.
Will this intense activity to burnish the blazon of England at the EC?
Nothing is less safe because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack assets with its already prepared stages, his expertise (World-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 Portugal) and its culture football.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects for the two countries could shower their ambitions.
Possible retaliation against English and doubts about the creditworthiness of Spain and Portugal merely increase the dimension of Russia, become an outsider weight despite the shortcomings of his file (stadiums, hotels, transportation).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the run-up to the vote," a veiled allusion to the accusations of the British press against the EC.
"They are covered by mud, trying to compromise," Mr Putin launched.
For 2022, the United States, strong the experience of 1994 seems a logical favourites.
First global economic power, seat of the main sponsors of Fifa, the country seems to have a long in advance on Japan and South Korea, which has built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new applications seem premature in 2002 for two countries Co-having organized the test.
Another threat. the granting of World-2026 in China, ardently wanted by Fifa, which would make it null and void asia's prospects for 2022.
In Qatar, which left the big game by offering futuristic stages, Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion into new areas, but both countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of the laid-off TV rights (because of jet lag) by European countries, Money for Fifa.
Second term. obvious
Charles de Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand had believe that he hesitated.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaings and Jacques Chirac did not have the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
A mandate in the Elysée calls another.
So the current Head of State will be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious does not make good household with the share of mystery attached to the presidential office.
Then it should be made as if doubts still existed.
In a sense, as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing in it, friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15th, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011."
It evokes ahead of the UMP members of Parliament, Tuesday evening at the Elysée, the prospect of "two terms" sowed some febrility.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
It was far.
The president did nothing but recall that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited to two the number of five-year periods.
He made a report, an announcement.
It is not the first time that it evokes the presidential election, on the tone of humor, at the time of such meetings.
"In the worst case, or at best, you still have some for seven and a half years with me," he had started to them in July 2009.
In May 2010: rebelote "Do not believe I just do not think the point, according to."
His remarks day before yesterday do not make it better candidate than the day before. they do not make it less.
If they cause comments, it is for a reason.
The acceleration of the race to the candidacy for the PS, on the one hand.
But that is not the entry on lists of Royal who pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to be revealed.
It is on the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is clear that much of the PS claims a battle command commander earlier than expected.
Bad polls, besides.
For the first time the right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon, Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L' Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion UMP on top," immediately and carefully the entourage Prime Minister responded.
"If he believes the defeat, he will not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin entrusts.
"He will always seem to win," Alain Juppé corrects resigned, of course.
Euro. the ECB to keep its purchases of securities of State
The last meeting of the governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was the opportunity to clarify methods way out of crisis or, at least, to announce the arrest of a number of unconventional operations of monetary policy should be completed by the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt obliges, issuing house Frankfurt will not likely be able to afford to be as peremptory under penalty of aggravating the tense situation more on European bond markets.
The political cost would be all the more high.
Yesterday, at a press conference, the Finance Minister, french, Christine Lagarde, hailed the active role played by the ECB in favour of the resolution of debt in Europe.
She did not want to say whether she thought the central bank to do more, by increasing for its program of buying sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my reflection in my European partners (...)."
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the commission for Economic and monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet has not been more eloquent about his intentions, content to indicate that the program of buying bonds of State on the resale market "continued," and that "we will see what we will decide" during the meeting this Thursday.
Only certainty. the ECB will keep it intact key interest rate to 1%, its lowest historic level since May 2009.
In effect, the purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled last week, with nearly 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of operators market, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds, yesterday.
On the whole, the central banks of the eurosystème bought for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among the operators of market expectations of a continuation of the purchases are no doubt (see page 29).
Economists either do not expect notable change of course.
If the lending operations of more than three months already disappeared from the arsenal from the ECB, they still leads unlimited allowances of liquidity by generous conditions and durations being staggered a week in three months.
Economists expect that this device is prolonged for a few months.
"I can not believe that modifies in a big way its agenda."
"Otherwise it would be to risk provoking new short-term tension," Michael Schubert, Commerzbank economist estimates.
"A gradual exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 is more likely," anticipates on its side Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
As for his interventions on the national debt, "the ECB should maintain a volume purchases of these bonds to animate a dull market," Norbert Bräms adds.
Given the importance of exposures of European banks to the sovereign debt in the eurozone, issuing house does not have other options to maintain its presence in the market.
"It is necessary for him at all costs to replace the lack of investors on the market and to act this way to prevent runaway the returns paid by the most fragile States," an important bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates fly away, States will be all the more forced to reduce their debt, if not to stabilize it.
Safeguarding the euro at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government makes the ban back
After an alarming start of the week for Italy, relaxed a bit, then, to flow backward bond rates in 10 years.
A return to a state of calm uneasy.
For leaving a meeting with the Minister of Economy, presidents region said to have targeted Giulio Tremonti to call the "indecipherable" and to expect a "wild" weekend that the interested party then contradicted.
Tuesday in any case, the gap with German long rates had reached a record of 210 basis points and the price of the contracts to hedge against the risk of default (CDS) had stolen away at 263 points, leading to some panic in Rome.
As a Council Of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with German rates were above 400 basis points.
But the right man, Gianni Letta, said "highly concerned" by turbulence in the markets" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy third euro-zone economy is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In light of its problem is the lack of growth and lifelessness of tax revenues that goes with, to run the risk to be able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels was a cold shower for the government.
The Italian growth is now expected 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under review in the Senate on counts 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the budget deficit will account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% predicted by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor mill new supplementary estimates that could be implemented after the festivals, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures beings will be taken," the commissioner believes in economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy, receives support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of the economy are in order and his books are good, we repeat this for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the international Monetary fund in charge of Italy in the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate future, on the court and in the long - run, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, note), the efforts of stabilization asked Italy are less than those asked other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
But the question of political instability.
On December 14th, Silvio Berlusconi will face a vote of no confidence in the Chamber Of Deputies, following what early elections would be held at the end of March.
A period not conducive to decision-making in the event of serious crisis would open.
Europeans think the anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde still hammered it yesterday in a press conference in Paris. "The Europeans I think we still have shown Sunday in the course of the day and night, obviously related, are determined, pledged to defend their currencies and monetary zone."
Although much relative, easing recorded yesterday on the rates of European government bonds provided water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But you can not speak yet a beginning of normalization.
The Standard credit rating agency & Poor' s.a announced that it would degrade the grade debt of Portugal, the most targeted by the speculation.
"In May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs in on the banking systems," economists at Exane BNP Paribas estimate.
More importantly, as "political time is slower than the markets."
This hiatus and the dangers it conceals European countries intensify talks to strengthen the existing anti-crisis devices.
The informal consultations between Finance Ministers most directly involved and, more broadly, with their peers of the g-20 are good progress.
And this altough for meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin of the early next week.
The ECB meets today.
The menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support the eurozone countries in the firing line of the market (see above).
As for the European financial stability (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday in Singapore a round of Asia to inform investors natives of the Far East developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of these visits are not rising of funds, it is surely it.
The first emissions of securities of the EFSF is expected next month.
Yesterday, an American official representative given to the agency Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in the funds mobilized by an additional direct involvement of the IMF.
Countries that are in the first line, Portugal and Spain, and for them, preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly as regards market organization of work.
Reforms that are added to the austerity measures to achieve closer.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different from those of Greece and Ireland.
And the other a point at all costs avoid demanding an international aid before litmus up their own budget corrective measures and deciding key structural reforms to revive confidence durably.
The money-lenders, finally, discuss the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of sovereign bond markets.
Crossing to Paris on November 24th, Axel Weber had the first argued that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the international Monetary fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to give a hand to the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, an actor of the first plan of the European sovereign debt, judge that an extension of approximately 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle is. it is equipped For European financial stabilization, to date, 60 billion euros.
A council which is likely to be examined closely in European capitals.

Snows and glaze. 24 departments on orange alert
The snow-covered episodes still generate traffic jams, particularly on the district distributors in Brittany, and are likely to disturb some economic activity.
Twenty-four services are now in orange alert because of the risk of snow and glaze.
The Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Two-Sevres and Vienna, was added to the 20 departments already in orange alert, 18 since Wednesday afternoon, and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Weather France, constant snow showers affecting northern the Gironde and Charentes and it snows slightly on the Ile-de-France.
Fields of snow ranging from 2 to 5 cm, punctually from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the services, and from 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments affected are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes of Armor, Finistere, the Gironde, the Dordogne, Poitou and those regions Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snow-covered episodes are notable enough to generate traffic jams and disturb some economic activity, warns Météo France.
In the Coasts of Armor, many minor roads were forbidden to the heavyweights of more than 7.5 tons, axes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Traffic on the district distributors in Brittany is very difficult to the gendarmes who recommend to travel by his vehicle in the event of need and the flow of unquestionable bus FOR THE THIRD TIME was suspended for the day.
School transports were banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measure was planning to restrict the flow of heavyweights Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "invites all motorists with the greatest caution on the roads and adapt their control as a result."
The headquarters of civil aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel their 25% Thursday flights at paris airport in Roissy and 10% in Orly because their snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends the air passengers to contact their society.
In Britain, the Gatwick airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris. first financial drafts
Since time that the debate about the modernization of transport Ile-de-France beats full swing, billions of rain.
In the discussion at least.
One recalls including 23 billion for the subway Grand Paris that the Company of Paris must build.
To start the SGP, the State an equipment capital of 4 billion euros reported.
In the theoretical pattern, it is this sum will then enable the SGP to borrow on markets a share of the funding its double loop.
Now, finally arrives at the first additions.
The corrected finance law 2010, examined in supply committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the devices designed to find the beginning of this money.
They are two. the creation of a special tax of equipment and increased tax on desks in Ile-de-France.
The first, one reads the text of the bill, article 15, "with the benefit of Société public corporation of Paris."
It is quantified. "The product of this tax is 117 million euros a year."
The second is refitting of a tax on desks that already exists "in order to modernize it, to increase product and affect the increase in to the Company of Paris."
That would pay how much?
Mystery.
It is not quantified in the text.
It is far from the 4 billion.
"It is specified that the fiscal resources are added to the 4 billion euros of capital equipment will be mobilized by the State and will be provided to the Company of Paris as project," you can read in the explanatory memorandum.
The SGP do not find this shocking system.
"From the moment when we created recipes (two taxes, note), you can cover the studies over three years and then type in the 4 billion later, explains it."
"It will be enshrined in the budget and will progressively be learned."
The SGP estimates that 4 billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for fiscal 2014.
The device, which promised 4 billion is still the absent subscribers, is likely to cause a somewhat troubled parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on December 7th.
Hackers avengers and spies in diligence
The WikiLeaks affair has a value.
On one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal that is as scandal in front of the hypocrisy that governs the relationship between the States, citizens and the press.
Others, he says profound changes at the international level, and precedes a future dominated by the regression.
But let us proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, it is confirmation that every file was a secret service (a nation that is) is composed exclusively of newspaper cuttings.
"Extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual practices of Berlusconi merely paying for months what could be read in every newspaper (except those whose Berlusconi is owner), and the profile sinisterly caricatural of Khadafi was long for the artists of cabaret matter to sketch.
The rule that the secret files should be composed only already well-known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go into a bookshop on esoteric publications, you will see that work repeats (on holy grail, the mystery of Rennes-the-Castle, the Templars or the Rosicrucian Brotherhood) exactly what was written in the works.
And not just because the perpetrator hide texts does not like to do new research (or does not know where to look for news on the nonexistent one), but because those who are doomed to occultism believe only so that they know already, and reconfirms what they had already learned.
It is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
Idem for the secret files.
The adviser is lazy, lazy (or limited mind) the head of the secret services (otherwise it may be, I know, the editor of Libération), which regards as true only what he admits.
Information secret signal on Berlusconi, whom the us embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as those Newsweek published the week before.
So why the revelations about these cases did do so much noise?
On one hand, they say that any literate person already knows that embassies, at least since the end of World War ii, and the Heads of States can phone or take a plane to meet with dining, lost their diplomatic work and, except some small exercises representation, transformed themselves into centers of espionage.
Any spectator of movies investigation knows that very well, and it is only through hypocrisy that is a semblance ignore it.
However, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and is used to place in a bad light American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that one to hack indefinite can collect the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world carries considerable blow to the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal is not as well in the crisis as the "torturers."
But let us come to major nature of what happened.
Once, when Orwell, one might imagine to be a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Prophecy orwellienne had fully proven since being able to control every movement through the phone, each transaction made, visited the hotel, the motorway borrowed and so on, citizen became the victim of the eye of power.
But when one shows, as happens now, even the crypts of the secrets of power can not escape control one to hack the report of control stops are one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least to hack it - elected as avenger of the citizen - can all know the secrets of power.
How can a power that is no longer the possibility of preserving its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel said already that a real secret is an empty secret (and empty secrecy could never be revealed.) it is true that, as any knowledge on the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret of secrecy, because the public domain. but to reveal, as did WikiLeaks, the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets way to remove any power to him.
WikiLeaks did not do any wrong to Sarkozy and Merkel, but was too big for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted with a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, governments will not be able to online information reserved any longer - that would come down publishing it on a poster mired in the corner.
But it is equally obvious that with current technology, it is vain hope to be able to keep confidential relations by telephone.
Nothing easier than to discover if and when a Head of State moved in the plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could the private and reserved reports continue in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my forecast concerns science fiction and is so romantic, but I am compelled to imagine government officials who moves in a low-key way diligences with the uncontrollable routes, while carrying only by heart learned messages or, at most, by hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be stored in single copy in drawers closed at key. basically, the attempt at espionage of Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technological advances now out of crab, i.e, to balk.
A century after the telegraph wire without revolutionized communications, Internet restored a telegraph on son (phone).
The video-cassettes (analogical) had helped researchers in movies to explore a film step for step, while going forward and behind and discovering some of the secrets of the assembly, while maintaining CD (digital) only allow jump in chapter in chapter, i.e by macroportions.
With trains at high speed, goes from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane travel, and that includes, it takes three and a half hours.
So it is not that extraordinary policy and communications technology to the horse-drawn carriages.
A last observation.
Previously, the press tried to understand what was woven into the secret of embassies.
Now, the embassies require confidential information to the press.
Climate. how France fiddles with his promises of funding
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine respect promises of funding quickly resolved (known as financing quick start and early) led by developed countries.
And the great French messing around is revealed.
The Copenhagen agreement, the developed countries committed to providing 30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (420 million) a year.
At the opening of the COP16, left the game to persuade its partners reality of his commitment regarding the financing fast start. report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, great side vent, distributing booklets...
The disclosure is welcome and appreciated with its fair value. developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU says to be released in 2010 of 2.2 billion euros, which puts him on the right path for respect of its commitment from 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money should be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional" in order to ensure that an extra effort is carried out without the expense of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what means "new and additional."
While the European Commission proposed harmonization, some Member States including France blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
The European Commission for example, considered a benchmark year 2009. the international financing are maintained, and it adds 150 million it over three years under the financing fast start.
Other countries chose similar references in terms of year or terms of level of government aid to development.
On the other hand, France estimates that the financing of "all new projects" 2010 "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to the spending of the previous decade or the total level of government Aid to development.
Concretely, the total amount of support in France for developing countries can remain stable (or decrease), it claims to respect its commitments on "new and additional" funding...
Another crucial factor, distribution between grants and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everybody chooses his way of calculating.
Some, like France, see 1€ lent is equivalent to 1€ determined.
Obviously, that is not easily justifiable. the effort is not comparable.
If use of loans can be justified for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to mitigation of the emissions that relies on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to one euro will recover as equivalent to one euro that gives... At most, should be included in its commitments only the cost of borrowing for the country lender (either the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has only to make such thinking. he "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) to document the EU to check by yourself.
It is the only country to use borrowing so heavily.
Germany needs to 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (other) honor their commitments to 100% of donations.
In other words, when the majority of the eu puts 1€ to meet its commitment, France put only 10 cents and considers the effort is similar.
Pretty conjuring trick!
In short, its financing fast start, France operates a swindle. on the one hand on the evolution of the action in time and on the other hand the reality of the effort.
By spending just 36.1 million euros, it manages to believe that he spends about it 420 "new and additional" millions in coherence to its promises.
The manipulation of the treasury (because it seems that it is Bercy who led the arbitration) could have a negative impact, both within the EU (why other Member States would continue to give whether it is enough to lend?) and negotiations since developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter of the early financing is only one small, relative term, compared to the discussions about climate.
But it may be a grain of sand in addition to the vast machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that will not be the case.
Nevertheless, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
First, France could signal a change in regime of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect its commitments and fairness to the other countries of the European Union.
But more importantly, France could advance discussions about the challenges of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently being debated). one can not escape the question of "additionality" or the regime from accounting from the loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these challenges as it is on a different one.
So hope rests on the new Minister of Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
An announcement surprised by the rapid start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would be natural to increase the level of international confidence needed to advance in the talks.
Alarm with pesticides, introduced by kids
A 10 year old child introduces overnight 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published Wednesday that association Future Generations (ex- Mouvement for human rights and respect for future generations).
Association, which prevents that its results "do not have significant statistic given the low number of analyzed samples, but are illustrative treated problems," bought between July and September food is consumed in four meals and a encas in one day by a child of ten years, supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
The standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh result and vegetables, dairy products and 1.5 liter of water per day - as well as delicacies were examined by companies in search of chemical substances, pesticides and heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the golan is overwhelming. 81 chemical substances of which 42 are rated cancer-causing possible and probable and five cancer-causing substances classified as some 37 products to act as endocrinal disturbers (EP), according to studies of several institutions such as the international research Center on cancer.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for every chemical substance taken individually are not exceeded, one sees in our survey that the reality of the exposure of consumers to potentially cancer-causing contaminants and/or EP is scary," association notes.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk alone contain more than ten potential cancer-causing residues and three proven as unquestionable carcinogens such as almost a score of residues might disturb the hormonal system.
The apple, imported Brazil, planned as encas by the study, presented the footsteps of six chemical substances including a fungicide but banned in France.
Even for French beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
Moreover, ground beef, tuna out of the box, and even bread rod and chewing gum were truffles of pesticides and other chemical substances.
In tap water analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and administers chloroform to.
For dinner, salmon steak was more "rich" with 34 detected chemical residues and even the review board to figure used to heat the meal with the microwave it was not free.
The risk for consumers "cocktail parties of contaminants" is probably underestimated," according to the study.
Green Alliance Europe Ecology (EE-LV) on its side, offered "to the urgency of the situation" founding a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilization."
In July, a study of the European agency for food security (EFSA) gave a report on the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in grain.
