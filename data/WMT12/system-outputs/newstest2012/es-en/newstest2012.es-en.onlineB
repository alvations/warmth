The parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
Ukraine&#39;s parliament today rejected a proposal to repeal the amendment to the Penal Code section condemning the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the former prime minister released from prison, but the parliament rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly signing a disadvantageous agreement with Russia to Ukraine on natural gas purchases.
The sentence is not yet final, the appellate court is required to review in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West have been doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Penal Code which ordered the former prime minister was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
For approval were required 226 votes.
The victory of Libya
The history of the liberation of Libya, or Libyan rebellion, and has its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi was buried in a secret location in the desert and without it there is no war.
It remains to define who is the winner
As has become customary in the region, Islamists won elections, but now it is necessary to ascertain whether it is moderate or radical
The National Transitional Council has made entry into force of customary law, sharia, already somewhat familiar.
Libya will become a country without crime because the robbers were cut by hand.
Women can go and forget about emancipation and the rebels awaiting execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator by the person, society, composed of warring tribes, will join in the Qur&#39;an.
In Libya, establish an order that we can not even imagine and certainly can not.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably did not suit them, however, the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that not surprising that Islamic fighters gratefully accept help from infidel dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, NATO airstrikes directed not an American general, larger but Allah, whose greatness held after each successful interventions.
When searching for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a shootout served the Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally with no guarantees of profit.
After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the premises do not pose a problem to drive the &quot;crusaders&quot;
But, without occupation, how the oil will get done with the black gold Libyan only with good words?
Quite possibly not, but it might finally West can boast of protecting human rights.
Provided that the followers of the sharia not cross us.

The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local computer to the end and also to the excellent game and the heroic Jiráček Čech, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated his move to the Championship of Europe.

Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages
More than a third of children aged between 9 and 13 are overweight, where overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity to 5%.
Obese children mostly come from families with a lifestyle that is unhealthy, as is clear from current research.
It again shows how important is the environment where it is grown for healthy development of the individual as well as serve as reference models.
In the table, obese children are fed, for example, sausages at least twice as likely than children from families with normal weight.
For dinner, over 19% of the obese had dined on chips before analysis, which is linked to the prevention program &quot;Obesity is not a chance.&quot;
In families of overweight children no custom of sports, which applies to most families today, where only 15% of children said their parents, at least once a week, find time for exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted late last school year and participated in it nearly 900 children of basic education throughout the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of the program &quot;Obesity is not a coincidence&quot;, which supports the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, participated in the project over 12 thousand children from the 4 th to 8 th grade.
Proper diet and plenty of exercise as a family are determinants, which decrease significantly the number of overweight and even obesity.
&quot;Only half the children surveyed responded that they have five meals a day according to the scheme: breakfast, lunch, dinner, lunch and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet,&quot; reflects one of the survey results .
No breakfast but for dinner sausage
Experts warn that, in healthy development, are important as well, the details, they also have, such as having a set time for breakfast with the family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of families had breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each breakfast alone.
But worse was to discover that 10% of households do not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is, however, the base of a proper diet.
The study shows that in families of obese children consume much more often unhealthy chips.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drink sweet drinks daily (70%).
Generally make sport more than 40% of the children surveyed, however, between their parents this result reduces to less than half, only 15%.
Fabricate your diet
The next phase of the study allowed the kids elect (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) will create their own diets from all possible deals according to your tastes and opinions.
&quot;Food preferences of Czech children aged between 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far from ideal.&quot;
Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
&quot;It is especially alarming popularity of sweet drinks,&quot; he warns in the final study report.
As a main meal takes the biscuit dough and follows closely the poultry.
Practically, children always reject the legume and a taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Healthy habits change
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
&quot;In the control group of study participants who completed the questionnaire after completing the prevention program&quot; Obesity is not a chance, &quot;was in many cases a major change in favor of the principles of healthy eating &quot;noted in the results of the study.
It is striking, for example, on sweet soft drinks, where many children begin to prefer the ordinary water.
Children also choose more often in the questionnaire poultry and fish for the main meal and restrict the consumption of sweet foods and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In the introductory article, How to learn the stylists, I complained that some initial lessons were already highly charged.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences of three professionals in the industry, how to dress problematic characters and also a seminar on how it works in show business.
And it will be worse.
The closer the final exams, more information and practical tasks lie ahead
And although the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, and not be a pin.
Once we have studied with the principal, Alena, (in the course no man) on how to dress women who do not have perfect symmetry.
And that&#39;s the majority.
Someone is cuellicorto, someone has a stylized figure without appropriate curves and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know optically smooth broad shoulders, neck lengthening or recreate the charts needed
We have given some tips on how to highlight women&#39;s body type of Jennifer Lopez, huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and yet dress in a manner not too challenging
If, for example, the difference between waist and hips is such that the skirt or pants do not fit, sewing is worth doing at least one piece of extra fabric to size.
Surely you will not regret, because the clothes feel well is priceless.
With a skirt as you will feel much better than one that does not stop moving, get up, dance around the waist, etc..
The slim body be allowed to wear clothing with folds, ornaments, embroidered or drapes.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I&#39;m glad that I have all week to put order in my head all this information.
And even so, I fear that with the assignment, I have more than enough.
Each course participant has been assigned two famous, who should design two costumes: one for daytime and one for the night.
Keep in mind the current look, the fashion style that suits the person.
I have had to &quot;dress&quot; Miranda Kerr, perhaps the campaign may know Victoria&#39;s Secret.
Cry on the inside, for me is much better than, say, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who recently put on a few hundred kilos will (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
The dresses have to cut them from magazines or search online and print, and then develop them graphically.
The mood board, which is the name of the complete result is further our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is important to also consider the graphical styling.
The stylist, therefore, did not see only physically but also addresses, for example, the product pages in magazines (of specific topics such as trends, handbags, coats, etc..).
From all this we talked the stylist and designer Mario Kamenik.
But this is already for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three invited speakers encouraged the conference on Saturday with information on all body types.
Honza Pokorný stylist, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renc.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should take advantage of this saberle.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
The variability is, in this case essential.
Thus, this raincoat (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can dress up the classic jeans and shirt, but also serves to clothe the naked body with high heels and photograph as if it were actually a dress.
Or just arremangarla and up the neck to get a totally different picture.
&quot;Play with it,&quot; he said.
What I value most is the following advice: &quot;To start working, you first need may know all the rules.&quot;
&quot;Then now you can break them,&quot; said Jakub.
I finally clear why memorize all these formulas, what goes with what, why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothing in the reservation of the intended photograph.
Thus, for a fashion story with ten pages (so, ten outfits), it must be prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And the photos clothing works in combination with other pieces, all different from those used in reality.
This must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the look and feel represent themselves, in many cases, half of success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and márquetin have made her a worldwide star.
In the Czech Republic, for the moment, there is still a clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even celebrities are also useless (my skills are enough for me, my physical appearance is not as important).
And when someone asks us our services, we must bear in mind that we are likely to indicate a size very different from their own real (lower).
Then only is GOOGLE and find out if the gossip magazines have written about it, if a certain celebrity has gained / lost weight, etc..
On Sunday, Mario Honza and we insisted that the stylist is not enough fashion oriented, but must understand outfit.
During his work, especially must communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
Value people know, is not less, defend their opinions.
&quot;When you hire a director for her clothing and clasifiquéis completéis it with pretty clothes, you can not catch and throw everything he had and say,&quot; Wow what a horror. &#39;&quot;
&quot;Find at least a couple of things that you can ponder and recommend to someone can put them,&quot; says Mario.
He also showed us that everything must fit into the &quot;placovka&quot;, ie the labor exchange.
This is set around the waist and have all the tools there.
Are objects such as scissors, scissors, quitapelusas or miss. There are also nylon thread (which serves as the stylist for the photo shoot of such products as handbags and hats), special clips ahead clothes hook, whichever is greater (the pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, they may damage the fabric), or a sewing kit.
To not stay in the passive listening and putting something into practice, we have learned to take the soles of shoes.
Even during the photo shoots in the studio, on a flat surface, could damage the soles and even more abroad.
And we did more than take and take.
We could not touch the shoes with scissors to avoid damaging them by accident.
So I had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy to praise my work without reservation.
The truth is that not very well give me those skills.
This is only a small part of everything we&#39;ve heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
Now I realize that devote to professional level styling is not a path of roses, but I&#39;m just like what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run is racing across America.
Review
A journey, in principle carefree, is complicated by a series of improper neglect a routine trip for the morning shift.
To some extent succeeded in meeting the expectations, but this is useless, if not actually intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new release, the title to which is added The Run, and raised high expectations before its release.
He promised to give new life to old racing franchise Need for Speed ​​and, following what is shown, appears as a game that should not end up being again a no further action genre.
We are also curious about how the scenes would be inserted, where the main character gets out the car and walks on his own feet.
As often happens in the NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are careers that can be given for acceptable, but in calculating total points are lost because of absurd faults, which are already appearing on the show for years.
In fact can neither be called errors, but is rather incomprehensible reluctance of programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
It introduces you into a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has some personal problems to solve, is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You sit at the wheel on the West Coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to arrive early to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten steps and then over fifty races.
It follows that each race is a different route and stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, one does not have anywhere near the feeling that the game offers the same thing.
Some environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to the previous installments of the series.
Therefore, there is no big deal.
But the walk through the desert, autumn landscape or high snow capped mountains produce a very nice visual effect.
In addition, the races are diversified occasionally by an atypical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you encounter a sandstorm visibility decreases.
In contrast, in the mountains must be careful lest you bury an avalanche.
According to this, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a few models, but that&#39;s enough.
For a moment you try to overtake a number of competitors required (normal in a classic race), then you try to buy time (timed classic duel) and then awaits a match against a single opponent.
Amid all this appears sometimes the police, which only further complicate things.
The novelty is the landscape outside the car.
We present interactive animations when Jack, in most cases, someone has to escape and you have to help, always pressing the button just at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
Surprisingly, however, there is far less scenery in the game than expected (in particular there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the circumstances already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.
That means today is no longer a big deal, but you can not say that bad.
If you seek a realistic simulation, and can look elsewhere.
But a race conceived quite enough action suits this style of driving, but we can find something better between games of competition.
So far, so good.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the right of driving models, no longer the case with collisions.
In games of this type is not expected to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a strike against any object, you can not predict how your car will react, so that not everything is in order.
Typically, when making a tight overtaking or move the car with normal traffic, only has slight rubbing, but almost identical in other situations, your car just pirouetting out of control.
Or even just totally destroyed.
Thanks to reset, no major problems arise, but can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are scheduled so that, when you suffer an accident or you go off the track, the game restores to last savepoint on the track.
However, in each race only has five resets available.
If you consume all, you must restart the race from the beginning.
So is only an aid in case something does not go well, but not very reliable.
Sometimes they do not reset help, just helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A major drawback of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some corners, for example, must be entered in a specific way, otherwise, are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself somewhere vehicle &quot;civilian&quot; always with the same configuration, even if you&#39;re the first, fifth or arrive five minutes earlier or later.
This makes raging especially in situations when you see two cars going in opposite directions to the meeting, your opponent forward smoothly, but when you arrive, you must turn or stop.
It&#39;s the same when arrive, because it is programmed by the &quot;surprise&quot; always happen in front of your nose.
Opponents also have an advantage.
Throughout the game you will come to places where, regardless of the time, I always advance the same opponent in the same place.
Also this happens at the end of the game in a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must come before you, at any cost.
When he goes before you, I obscures the view of oncoming cars, so at first you can crush the car.
One can understand the idea of ​​creating a game with high doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that surely disappoint you right away.
It is a shame, because although the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and action, so that often can not follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really does not matter if the idea has merit fifty or classification exclusive tracks in the race for the avoidance of boredom, or anything else.
Unusual idea is to change cars during races.
You must be aware of the petrol pumps beside the road, because there just have to change cars, but in most cases what you have will suffice.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars to the highways straight and exotic supercars to drive technique, for example, curvy mountain roads.
Besides the main narrative thread also appears a parallel challenges, ie, there are careers in specific places that know the stories.
Here gettin not only medals, but experience points to your profile, which serves both the challenges and stories.
Upon reaching the top level, the driver will open several possibilities, starting with the car and ending funding for the profile.
At the same time, there are connected online Autolog function that compares your results with other players and make available other community functions.
One of the most difficult to understand is how is made the final race in history.
With the car you come to the Tube (go), where you set about running in the dark by the way (pass).
The speedometer will make between 150 and 200 km / h (pass) and suddenly, behind you the convoy reaches the subway and takes you no further ahead.
In writing we will certainly have a discussion about this for several days, whether during programming of the game no one thought even a little or if the authors really take us for a bunch of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual effects are in most cases enjoyable, sometimes even arrogant.
Well, what a pity that in the tensest moments reduces the image quality and, sometimes, in a grave.
This applies especially where there are accidents involving many participants, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is good and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to be pleasing to most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category &quot;each of his father and mother,&quot; but one can assume that nobody would buy the game only for his music.
The final sense of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
Avoided if the game absolutely dumb mistakes, we would have problems in saying that The Run is the best game of NFS in recent years.
It seems that the game is not over.
Fun is guaranteed, but be prepared because you hit the errors in eyes with the force of some reflectors airport.

Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation of naysayers and Eurosceptic.
&quot;The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions&#39;
&quot;I did not expect reassembly-out war.&quot;
&quot;It will last five, six years before the situation stabilizes a bit, calm down and new players get used to their new roles,&quot; with conviction and began his lecture at the Law Faculty of the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová.
How not to take seriously the motto &quot;Europe clearly and openly,&quot; he said as early as the first part of his lecture, when he managed to describe every organ of the EU and its relations with such precision and clarity, it would be the envy of many speakers Faculty of Law, U. Carolina.
Vicenová also praised the work of the new permanent European Council president, Herman van Rompuy:
&quot;First come the criticism, if it is bland, a gray, capable of assuming any role, but I must say that left everyone confused, because it assumes their roles to perfection.&quot;
&quot;He is a man who listens to members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and has a very clear vision of where the EU should go.&quot;
The new post of representative of the foreign and security policy is explained from the question &quot;Who is this EU? What number I can call?&quot;. It is therefore an important step towards unification and clarification of union policy towards states like China or India.
Nobody wants to forbid the cheese from Olomouc
Vicenová has also worked on the agenda was, is and will continue the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs took care of the emerging economic crisis, solved the gas crisis and organized a summit for Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador: &quot;a good riot&quot; not only the presidency but also the financial crisis being treated now.
On the other hand, we must adopt the budget for seven years in the EU, caused by the current economic situation more complicated.
If the budget is more simple and effective, which sectors have priority, which countries will receive more support and the least? That is something that will be on the agenda for the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled their main slogans with which came to Europe: &quot;Europe About clearly.&quot;
&quot;The truth is that I do not like ugly abbreviations, foreign words or jargon that people do not understand.&quot;
&quot;How can a citizen realize that Brussels is not really invent the curvy cucumber cucumbers or round, bananas of different sizes or that no one is going to ban cheese from Olomouc?&quot;.
It also aims to get more out of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens to the European institutions.
Europe awaits speeds
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people see the negative rather than positive.
He regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
Blame it on many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write messages of motivation, but also little support for the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, emphasized the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
&quot;Believe me when I go to a Pole and a Hungarian and a Slovak me about a Frenchman next to me says:&quot; What ye been, the Visegrad Group? &quot;And you see that does not make no grace. &quot;
In the future, the EU, according Vicenová, await new regulations harsh budgetary policy for the Member States.
It is perceived as very real concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, rather than the new &quot;European Federation&quot;.
&quot;We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the eurozone.&quot;
&quot;We have the Schengen area and also the enhanced cooperation procedure.&quot;
&quot;They first said that only countries that want to cooperate and not to be left out.&quot;
&quot;These procedures will become more and strengthen the two-speed Europe&quot; is expected Vicenová.
In this sense, also highlighted the role of Czech and Herman van Rompuy on the principle according to which all matters affecting the whole EU should be discussed between member states, not only among members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century
If someone searched for a term that would define very precisely the strategy of IBM, the closest would be &quot;long term&quot;.
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived to be present and yet one hundred years have passed since its foundation.
The basis of this character largoplacista put the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Mr. Watson
And he coined the slogan that many world problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
Their motto &quot;Think!&quot; became his trademark, round which will be built the future life of the giant (he was also the title of an internal IBM magazine began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a corporate culture carefully lifted.
&quot;For us, IBM implies a long-term thinking, a continuous movement toward the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years for that reason, because he remained true to his principles, but fear the changes around them.
This has allowed us, during our first century, transforming technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper further in our second century, &quot;for their anniversary, the current company director Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, now in the 30&#39;s, worried about the care of its employees as the employer of Bata in the Czech Republic (the employees of IBM were among the first U.S. workers enjoyed paid vacations, insurance, uniforms, elegant and sophisticated payment system rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication IBM maintains the customer relationship.
From the beginning the company was able to discover talent (being one of the world leaders in ending all forms of discrimination, could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM&#39;s current plan, which will replace Palmisano to next year a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She already has worked thirty years at IBM, where he was head of sales, márquetin and strategies.
In recent years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, brainstorming online, from which arise numerous future strategies and innovations.
Not surprisingly, leftover ideas, because the signature work almost half a million people.
A reputable institution
The fixed position in the business gives the company a strong internal and external image.
&quot;From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than a technology company,&quot; says economist professor at the Harvard Business School and author of book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
&quot;IBM is a technology company but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users,&quot; notes George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company says there is a difference between going into business and create a business directly.
IBM - or the &quot;Big Green&quot; - as it is known in the U.S. familiar because of its logo, has become the last hundred years in one of the largest companies in the world.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (both equipment and develops programs, infrastructure and hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
Has the highest number of patents of all U.S. technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among his inventions are the ATM, payment cards, swaps, bar codes and floppy disks.
IBM will charge this year of $ 220 billion. This year has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first being Apple), when first passed in 1996 to Microsoft.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations just cater to the tastes of customers and the time (IBM opted for its own operating system, OS / 2, Prodigy online services or computers IBM PCjr).
&quot;If your business is based on progress, not emotionally be anchored in the past,&quot; admitted Samuel J. Palmisano.
So IBM has no trouble building its bases in other platforms (and equally, if not work, the leaves).
And that&#39;s apart from the competition, Microsoft, which basically is maintained and always falls exclusively on Windows.
Future technology
Within sales, IBM is dedicated primarily to services, with approximately one fifth are one-fifth of programs and equipment.
Yet even in 1990 the teams representing more than half the share of suppliers.
Since 2000, IBM has sold underperforming assets totaling 15 billion dollars. During the same period, has invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when he first manifested the modern global financial crisis.
IBM acts on the premises of his first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great depression increased from 29 investments.
It seems that so far the company has managed IBM weather the crisis.
The value of the shares of IBM from the beginning of 2008 has risen stratospherically up to 120%, net profit of the company has continued to increase.
IBM&#39;s motto is to change everything except their value.
You can therefore expect that when the next crisis comes, this giant flexible endure.
History of IBM: from cheese slicer to spaceflight
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, and its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The IBM is a long established name in 1924 - originally it was a brand used in branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation that gave birth to IBM is a merger of four companies dating back to 1880.
Owned inventions such as the famous &quot;time clock&quot;, which controls the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Flint Ranlett, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.
Flint joined the head of a competitor, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with managing the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson&#39;s ideas remain the firm base on which to support the corporate culture and identity).
Watson ran the business until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started producing and selling all kinds of equipment for businesses, from cheese and meat cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson ran the company, sales doubled in $ 9 million and began the great expansion of the company by the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company, almost forty years after occupying the chair of the chief, was succeeded by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 60 staff and IBM computers helped guide NASA space flights (Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic &quot;fish&quot;, which implemented the standard computers of that time, came to market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to China&#39;s Lenovo, which, in turn, acquired the consulting business of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began offering comprehensive advice and services of high added value.
The strategy has paid the last three years IBM&#39;s Smarter Planet concept, ie a &quot;smarter planet&quot;.
Its aim is to make more rational use of technology, but not yet planned areas or circumstances have improved, for example, with regard to transport and city administration.
For commerce, IBM introduced the platform not long ago &quot;Smart Commerce&quot; that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
And in 1932 opened a branch in the then Czechoslovakia, the first country that had in the Central and Eastern Europe.
Here today, IBM ČR also operates strategic outsourcing center in Brno
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe has is in Prague. Also here is a team of world-renowned research working with speech recognition.
Rychtářová about her cheating husband:
Iveta, stay to the donkey, who no longer want it!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it&#39;s over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also his lover, Darina was still hoping that Joseph awoke from his dream and return home rose.
But will wait no longer and has established clear rules for life in the future.
&quot;Pepe can go home, but not as my partner,&quot; said Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová hosted Bartošové during the summer at home, I could not imagine how it would end their marriage.
Despite the petition, had not moved Iveta thirty days after Říčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
Even said publicly that he loved her.
Over time, Darina was resigned, apparently accepted her husband&#39;s relationship and even said goodbye to him forever.
A Rychytář not care who sleeps with his wife.
If one day break with Bartošová Rychtář, his wife would not expect it at home with open arms.
Is the biological father of my children and, if you want to live out their lives in our house, nobody will miss him. &quot;
&quot;But here I would live no longer as my dear old donkey that was wrong, but as a man certain bonds that bind me,&quot; he said adding that Rychtářová had already disengaged from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
A hitherto Josef does not care that woman has closed the back door.
&quot;I accept the decision of my wife.&quot;
&quot;I am with Iveta and no change possible.&quot;
&quot;My wife set this as a marriage on paper and I respect that.&quot;
&quot;The company remains in force, I arrange for home care for the garden, home, do the shopping.&quot;
&quot;Darina and I speak normally, only they do not share bed Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he would not object.
&quot;We did not sleep together and she does not interest me, or where it goes or if you have a boyfriend.
I know it&#39;s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility, &quot;concludes Joseph.
The worst vices of women: Do you also refer to you?
If you ask men who are able to cite some typical vices of women, in general each appoint them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize in the following lines, citing certain vices female getting blood boil to men?
Shopping
Does your significant other complains that you have reliance on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Would you like to shop often in the sales?
So if you can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women find that they should appease your passion for shopping, at least a little.
But see, what woman could resist the temptation to walk without more clothing stores, clothes look tight and then try them all in the fitting room (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a pastime for men can turn into a virtual hell.
Just remember how many times has already told your partner better wait outside the door.
The constant dissatisfaction
&quot;I&#39;m too fat?&quot;
&quot;I need lose weight at least five kilos - should start exercising?&quot;
&quot;You really like me?&quot;
Does not it sound like these words?
How so?
So it&#39;s one of those women obsessed with their appearance.
Not that you need to stop caring, but many people are allergic to listen to your partner complain all the time of its appearance.
Sex is also strongly agree that the more increases the frequency of complaints, most women become annoying.
The housekeeping first
It&#39;s like a carousel infinity.
Cleaning windows, vacuuming, mopping, dusting, scrubbing the tub and everything at least twice a week.
Does your partner complains that he has walked the floor clean with dirty feet, their children who have just cleaned dirty sink and a shelf with glass doors that you worked so hard to clean?
If you suffer this &quot;deviation&quot;, try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that the housekeeping probably should not take be paramount in the family.
This desire harmless cleaning could threaten their relationships and family welfare.
Make nasty comments
&quot;The shorts worn are left with the laundry.&quot;
&quot;Want to wear those socks tomorrow also used&quot;
&quot;The wet cloth is not left in the ground!&quot;
If these cometary makes your partner more times a day, know that this will give out of their boxes.
Naturally. You do not mean anything bad, just want to make sure everything is in order.
Maybe if men knew this, women, meanwhile, would not make so many comments.
Slander and gossip
Some women are also libel, slander, but also the offenses and the conspiracy against anyone.
Women are concentrated in relationships, why they like to talk together about things such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each one of us sometimes lets out a small, harmless gossip.
Hand on heart, this is typical of most women.
On the other hand, women gossiping of these are not controlled, they love to gossip and often do, look down on everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially on a female labor.
Voráček Jágr and helped with his assists to beat Philadelphia
The hockey forward Jaromír Jágr participated in the meeting on Monday with two assists NHL brought the 5:3 victory over Philadelphia in the field of Carolina and relocated to the Czech players at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took the play of the star 39, and went a step further and was declared man of the match.
Won two assists in the match and also the co-Jágr, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, he told reporters Jágr overseas Giroux had predicted a great night.
&quot;Even before the party had said it would triple.&quot;
&quot;I sensed.&quot;
&quot;Sometimes they seem ambushes,&quot; said Jágr, after his performance to give him a goal Giroux, following the first lash of the Flyers.
A while after the second intervention also had a track team Czech.
Voráček took the disc behind the goal for the Hurricanes and moved between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored a goal.
A second pause before the first local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second half and dominated the Flyers.
Specifically by Giroux.
After working with Jágr got the third goal after his shot to sneak through the room of the goal by Wayne Simmonds.
&quot;I love playing with him.&quot;
&quot;I do not mean to be the best player on the court, but it certainly is among the top three,&quot; praised his central Jágr.
&quot;I never would have happened at the end of my career was going to play with an athlete like him.&quot;
&quot;I am very pleased with it.&quot;
&quot;I want to play for him.&quot;
All these years in the NHL, my classmates were playing for me, and it now produces results, &quot;adds Jágr.
Carolina turned the game even in a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then back to Dwyer, a penalty, to put a goal away.
Read Matt did not allow more complications, but eventually outnumbered two to one.
&quot;Pronger had a good performance in our field.&quot;
&quot;Cleared the record, I took speed and Read went to the far side.&quot;
&quot;I tried to hit it hard and I&#39;m happy because I got it&quot;, described Voráček the last goal of the match as he lived.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Spacek, did not play until late in the game against Buffalo in the second third was removed by a lesion in the upper body.
The Canadiens not only lost a very experienced player on defense, but also by a margin of two goals, 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec failed to capitalize one of the shots.
More than the points lost local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and play the game with only five defenders.
&quot;That is bad.&quot;
&quot;We played the game only with a veteran player, the rest were newcomers.&quot;
&quot;Well, but against it is that you can not do anything, we have to deal with it,&quot; said Jacques Martin.
&quot;Both players rotate turned against us, we could not resist.&quot;
&quot;We had to further simplify the game, remove the disc from our field.&quot;
&quot;And so we leave gaps,&quot; said one of the defenses, P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec goalkeeper contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over the Tampa Bay.
The Jets goals were scored by five players who put an end to a series of defeats and lasted five games.
How prices have changed since 1989 trips
Until 1989 there was in the then Czechoslovakia only five state authorized travel agencies: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, and Autoturist Rekrea.
Travel agencies of that time sold in most cases only the socialist travel, for travel to the West were very limited.
Czech tourists were, therefore, on vacation to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in the Crimea on the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary ( Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when one could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime bowed to the west and travel for Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist bloc (ie, also the Czechs) are not allowed to travel freely and individually even by socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, Poland or the Soviet Union needed a letter of invitation, if not, the individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered at that time travel to the West, but you must queue up with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night, or have &quot;known good&quot; in the agency.
Yet all was not won.
The &quot;promise of change&quot; that was the condition for trips to the West, not attached to the &quot;politically unreliable people,&quot; so could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible currency without warranty of change was not possible to obtain the resources (money west) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so that a large number of cottages and summer homes, the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The mode of travel for the Czechs since 1989 has undergone a revolution.
While until 1989 for us was the ultimate holiday in the GDR and Bulgaria, the Czech last year made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.
It nna great paradox, which today we are not aware that the current favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989 no one could travel freely, because it was part of Yugoslavia then.
In the early 90&#39;s was imposed visa free travel to the neighboring states of Western Europe, causing a huge surge of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechs, for a long time, were not tired of the trips to the West, everyone wanted to see him at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris slept Czech groups in parks in tents, as our income then we were not allowed to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs at the time was the take with the food (canned food, sausages, etc.). To save.
Another highlight was the introduction of the convertibility of the koruna, so our visitors could finally, after decades, western currency bought freely.
Our standard of living and with it increased average wages, which around 1997 caused an increase in travel demand.
With increasing demand for travel agencies began, from 1997 regularly, prepare trips using charter flight connections, making it incredibly lower prices on travel compared to the past, thanks to the possibility to obtain volume discounts for passengers.
In the late 90s of last century, and the Czechs traveling without visas to almost all developed countries except the U.S., which further simplified our trips.
Another interesting moment in the history of tourism and post-revolutionary happened in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, every year start direct charter flights with Czech tourists was hot and distant countries. This winter already fly direct from Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
The visit exotic countries currently about 100 000 Czechs year.
Another interesting moment of this time, symbolizing our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, USA abolished visas for Czech tourists, so that our country came to be among the world&#39;s most developed countries.
In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time ever, have spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in its history, has been spent on foreign travel more than 15 000 SEK Czechs head, including spending on the ranch site.
Ordinary General Meeting convened to elect the president, who could end up back in neutral.
For nearly five months the Czech football is without a president and likely successor to Ivan Hasek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FACR), will not be known or after the notice of Extraordinary General Meeting next to be held on Thursday Nymburk.
In fact, not yet reached agreement on the voting rules to follow.
Without them, you can not even vote to choose between three candidates.
Those interested in chairing the Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned in June but not before his colleagues call for the purpose of finding a strong person who knew how to deal with the football in the future.
However, after concluding Hasek era, there arose a dispute between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement on a common candidate.
This became evident on September 16 when he had to be elected the new president.
Delegates to the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (Národní dům), located in the Prague district of Smichov, because the talks were blocked and not only in the method of choice.
There is no consensus as to who or the General Assembly had the right to vote - but also the legal representatives or delegates with full powers.
From that time and because of this one point, there was a partial agreement, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law under which the representation is not possible to full power.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation and could not drive or the Executive Committee at its meetings, regular or special, basically solved nothing.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the key point remains the same.
The question is: how will proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
&quot;The dispute revolves around whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model,&quot; says Dusan Svoboda, one of three vice presidents of the FACR, who, from the direction of the association represents the professional soccer.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round win one candidate with the highest percentage of support in the federation to which a candidate.
The Moravian is willing to compromise so you can win one candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The bohemian part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have the majority of at least two-thirds.
&quot;This would take, however, the sense of the previous two rounds and negate the whole concept of bicameral system,&quot; is as Svoboda understand the objections of the Moravian, whereby it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to applicable statutes.
With that said, surprisingly, agrees Thomas also Paclík, although it is assumed that the electoral rules established by the statutes of all candidates is best for Pelta.
&quot;I would like a vote as possible in accordance with the statutes.&quot;
&quot;To not make up any nonsense about the representatives as in the last General Assembly,&quot; says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and directing his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk be decided on the new president and he believes that candidates in the future cooperate constructively.
&quot;All passions appease today&#39;s match with our national team at the European Championships.
&quot;Football will be the protagonist, and thus cooperate more comfortable,&quot; said the representative of Jablonice, which of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
&quot;I hope they reach an agreement, but unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated.&quot;
&quot;This is not the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience.&quot;
&quot;This can result in a new blockade of the General Assembly.&quot;
&quot;Anyway, I hope common sense will prevail,&quot; said Rajchl.
There is not much time for all the parties reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until you start the game if the soccer team will be complete?
The special plane, which had to travel to Podgorica, including vice president Dalibor Rajchl Kucera and has not left this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to carry on the executive committee to take place where the qualifier.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, at last, could be taking place at ministerial level, which, they say, will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobes A Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, I would love to incorporate the divided parts of the organization&#39;s most powerful sports country to reach an agreement.
The stakes are high: state subsidies, the credibility of football and the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak federation of sport (CSTV) will try to give a new direction to the sport Czech financial problems after the house lottery Sazka.
Paclík fight for the presidency, because they can not find a suitable candidate.
If the head of the players of Pilsen, Tomas Paclik before the Extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all their ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FACR), or be a candidate to so important a position.
&quot;If there was a suitable person would be fighting for it and I stand as candidate in the elections.&quot;
&quot;But until today not been able to find a person,&quot; said Paclík to the Czech News Agency (CTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the ability to block Pelta, the presumed winner of the elections, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FACR).
Paclík also points out that, if overcome, would remain in office as president only until 2013, when it would turn to the ordinary general assembly.
In this role you would like to see an expert and good manager is not too related to football events.
&quot;I&#39;ve talked to some people they might consider.&quot;
&quot;For me it was crazy to hear some say that at this time not even want to identify with the Czech football.&quot;
&quot;I would like to change that view,&quot; he adds.
What bothers Paclík supposedly now is Pelta relationship with the President of the Regional Football Association Berbr Roman Pilsen, a man with a controversial past, known outside the scene as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence voting delegates at the general assembly.
Paclík is as unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
&quot;If you win, would remain in force status in football and nothing will change.&quot;
&quot;With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, soccer will draw even less profit,&quot; said Paclík.
He also mentioned that a few years ago called Pelta was associated with a wiretap during the investigation of a corruption case, which went unpunished Pelta.
&quot;I do not know what could bring prestige football Pelta&#39;s victory.&quot;
&quot;And with what eyes we look at the UEFA and FIFA,&quot; said Paclík, also taken with some caution his earlier statement that &quot;if you sell the Club Pilsen Pelta become president.&quot;
In the case of winning the election on Thursday, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
In same view is the other candidate, Rajchl, which has been supported by Paclík before the General Assembly in September that ended in a fiasco.
&quot;He (Pelta) would be the first to be followed.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s very capable.&quot;
&quot;I could imagine it, for example, as chief representative.&quot;
&quot;But not as an association manager.&quot;
&quot;I do not put my nose where I am able,&quot; he added Paclík, which in September raised a lot of attention for supporting the suspension of the Referees Committee chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that one would manage the partnership.
Uses its management capabilities of private companies, for since last summer is also the Director of Pilsen, whose support held in May in the first division victory.
&quot;I have power to change some things on the football field and contribute to safe practice.&quot;
&quot;To reduce the influence of pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary committee and appeal, resulting in unpleasant situations, said Paclík without hiding their dislike of the president Daniel Křetínský Sparta.
A priority would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FACR and Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which put pressure on political leaders to commit more money to sport lottery taxes.
&quot;One of the key issues that should be devoted to the new president.&quot;
&quot;If you increase taxes on gambling, as advertised political parties support their arguments, but, frankly, have to say where it will stop all this money,&quot; he says.
Also, now Paclík disregards even its association with the Club Pilsner, though he himself claims that the President of the FACR should be &quot;nonpartisan.&quot;
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla Prague.
&quot;It&#39;s not ideal.&quot;
&quot;But I see no meaning to the fact hypocritically give my actions Pilsen Club to another person and then go back there after a year and half,&quot; said Paclík.
Pelta FACR promised the new statutes that would end the stalemate in the election.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association a candidate for president, Miroslav Pelt, promised that if elected, would ensure that the new statutes FACR would definitely serve to solve in the future, disputes as to the electoral regulations.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about the meeting this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could progress towards a settlement today with the possible victory of the football team.
Even before the elections held in September, focusing Pelta promised, if elected, precisely in the representation and fundraising.
Decided to participate in the last minute in the last general meeting, so this delay of two months he could do well to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on the management of football.
&quot;People at all levels of football takes a long time ago and is looking forward to this Thursday the new President.&quot;
&quot;They feel it is time for someone to manage the association,&quot; the man who thinks primarily associated with Jablonice Club, but who worked in Sparta and the executive committee of the Association.
For this reason, thinks he has enough experience to manage the Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hasek.
&quot;Unfortunately, in June the General Assembly approved the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought.&quot;
&quot;If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September,&quot; Pelta said.
Exactly the rehabilitation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as bait to win over delegates.
&quot;If I am elected president, I&#39;ll take that as a personal challenge and am prepared to respond if this fails.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a matter of principle, without which we can not exist,&quot; Pelta said.
Moreover, in theory, try not to mess with his opponents.
Already in the past had warned that looked Rajchl working with Henry, whom he respects for his training in law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It had long without attacking Paclík Thomas who, unlike Pelta, left no stone cold.
&quot;It takes more than a year in the football world and has achieved some success.&quot;
&quot;Their attacks but were embarrassing and many people were surprised by the election campaign.&quot;
&quot;So many doubts about his true character,&quot; said his opponent Pelta, which remains faithful to the statements already announced in September.
Your most powerful weapon, according to him, his knowledge of football competitions from low to higher.
The latter should be a showcase for promotion of football.
&quot;Also, try to solve all the scandals that arose from the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal last year.&quot;
&quot;Immediately after I get involved in negotiations with public and private, to ensure there is enough money for all the football,&quot; said two months ago to the candidate ČTK 46.
Then also promised that his appointment as president of football does not entail any change of staff personnel.
&quot;I should first know the tasks of each employee,&quot; he said of Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy prevails understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios predict that before the next general assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain Thursday to Nymburk.
&quot;If the only sticking point is how to vote in the third round, I would definitely be able to overcome.
&quot;Football needs credibility, which will recover only if it finally has a leader,&quot; still two days before the most crucial time in his career as a representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, FACR begin to work with enthusiasm.
If the fourth General Assembly is elected Jindrich Rajchl the current vice president as president of the Czech Football Association, many people would show probably resentful.
Rajchl promises that if elected, would work hard.
Want to implement systemic change and make the executive committee members are responsible for each area individually football.
You also agree to settle the case of the Bohemians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, get more money for football and continue the work begun by former President Ivan Hasek.
&quot;As president, I would devote myself entirely to football.&quot;
&quot;Since international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the selection, to professional football or coaching youth soccer performance.&quot;
&quot;This is not to say I would do everything alone,&quot; he said in an interview Rajchl for ČTK.
&quot;I am a team player and want to divide the powers of the executive committee so that each member can engage in a specific area.&quot;
&quot;And will assign difficult tasks for football can, in each of these segments, go ahead with great momentum.&quot;
&quot;A lot of people this probably will not like it because it will mean starting work very hard and not just criticize the work of others,&quot; he added.
Because the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, is said to have considered the possibility of missing a candidate again.
&quot;Everyone knows that working 20 hours a day.&quot;
&quot;But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be people behind me to prevent and hinder me at every turn&quot;, explained the reasons for their indecision.
&quot;Many people have told me I should not give up, because then would also overcome the other.&quot;
&quot;This is not to abandon faith just like that,&quot; he said.
As they say, also motivates you to continue the work already started with Hasek.
&quot;During those two years, was completed much of the work that I do not want to lose now.&quot;
&quot;There are processes that had been started and will have an effect within a couple of years and I would not want someone to stop,&quot; said concerned by the fact that, if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could again be as it was before the time of Hasek.
&quot;I believe in order, and something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is unable to maintain.
&quot;Behind him is mostly all those people who would take care of football that was just a privilege for a select few.&quot;
&quot;I can blame a lot of things, but not the fact that I am for someone.&quot;
&quot;I try to be objective.&quot;
&quot;I want to make a football for all, because only then will feel good everyone, not just the elect,&quot; said Rajchl.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
&quot;Although some people try to claim otherwise, I have in mind to make the most of Moravia.&quot;
&quot;For example, it is time to think about the fact of dividing the second division in a Czech side and another Moravian, whose winners go to the first division.&quot;
&quot;Do not give the current situation where we have only three teams of Moravia, which is a problem for young Moravian players,&quot; said Rajchl.
Although the struggle of the presidential election Paclík joined Tomas, president of Club Pilsner, Rajchl not stop believing in their chances of being elected.
&quot;I still have strong support from the Czech federation, which I chose as his vice president and knows that behind me are clear successes,&quot; said Rajchl, whose hits include saving tens of millions of crowns disadvantageous contracts, television contract negotiations and the negotiations on the law of the lottery.
On the other hand, recognizes its share of blame for the federation is not connected.
And while claiming that Pelta is &quot;disqualified to restore confidence in the Czech football,&quot; considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.
&quot;No one can deny he did a great job for that year Pilsen.&quot;
&quot;In the event that is chosen is likely to continue what we started Ivan Hasek and would not change significantly the number of staff on committees.&quot;
&quot;I do not use that to my advantage,&quot; thus evaluated Rajchl rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump to the blue
by Julia Stanek
Pools from outstanding optics, sumptuous baths in Budapest: When visiting Europe can live their wonderful blue, and after a city tour or a walk, rest your tired legs in whirlpool baths.
One book shows where the best being in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip during the past year and a half, there was something he could not miss in your luggage, a swimwear.
Lying back on the water, looking at the art dome on top, swimming toward the marble angels, who were waiting on the edge of the pool and was astonished at the indoor pool meticulously restored Art Nouveau.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook when all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
The architectural historian Meder explored over 200 swimming pools in this way and presented in his recent book &quot;Badefreuden&quot;: indoor swimming pools in Munich, the historic palaces of the bathroom in the Black Forest, the &quot;concrete structures&quot; in Taunus.
He made his &quot;journey through the most extraordinary bathrooms Central&quot; by 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and city respectively Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46 year-old German is a real fan of bathroom culture.
Wants nothing to do with the sport, says Meder, only water is different.
Just upset that fans have to settle for the bathroom with blue tiles and smell of chlorine, while fans can breathe a fascinating run smell of pine forests or hear the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
&quot;One day I wondered why the pools have to be ever so ugly,&quot; says this resident of Vienna.
&quot;I started collecting beautiful pools.&quot;
Doubling the water surface architecture.
The splash in the pool and sauna ethereal oils. The feel good factor in the pools is so great because they serve all the senses, as Meder.
And if the constructor endeavors, indoor pools can be a real feast for the eyes: &quot;Instead of soil, in the bathrooms has a water surface.&quot;
&quot;For one thing is clear, moreover reflects the beauty of the whole building.&quot;
All bends optically: the high vaults, colored tiles, trampolines.
The picture book in small format &quot;Badefreuden&quot; in 190 pages provides very interesting data on the architecture and art history at the historic oasis of wellbeing, but mainly makes me want to jump into the blue.
Meder, the collector of the specimens featured pools discovered in his research in Hungary.
Besides the magnificent medicinal baths like Széchenyi Bath Budapest 100 years, are nitrates in waters with a unique karst cavity (cavity baths in Miskolc-Tapolca) and baths, which are pools of alkaline water and are in a building shaped bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the city lays eyes on the indoor pool of Zurich, you can look Arlberb, snow cover from the outdoor pool for a swim in St. Anton, and: In Turkish bath is a window from which you can see the practice of the ski slopes.
The design, perhaps more extraordinary awaits guests in Längenfeld: The Ötztal water cathedral looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
Three open source vapor rises in winter, while background Ötztal mountains rising on the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
A Meder, the collector of pools, not invading the smell of chlorine in all pools.
Many hot springs sulfur smell in the bathrooms of Árpád Bekescsaba, Hungary, the smell of diesel is so strong that people think they have reached a sanitary bathroom.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and silt which sticks to the skin to enter the pool, enjoy being in a special way.
Iris Meder also disappointed in a place in their search for nice places for swimming, when he wanted to visit outdoor pools and sunbathing in the Czech Luhatschowitz bathroom, he found a land locked.
The bathroom in 1902 by architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the windows of the building crumbling modernist red, white and yellow weed was growing between the tiles.
The decline countered in a lovely pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbald.
These baths have three phases of construction behind him, not only can discover elements neorománicos of it was built in 1844, but also a style Arabic Alhambra hall, added in 1900.
From their careful modernization in 1995, the Palace is the bathroom Thermal favorite collector pools, Iris Meder, and not just because it is natural in the Black Forest.
&quot;It has much merit different architectural styles merge into one unit so fantastic,&quot; said Meder.
In a palace and immersion in the thermal pool apparently not very important.
Land speculation
Deutsche Bank discusses the business of raw materials
By Christian Teevs
You give up the Deutsche Bank to its agricultural commodities business?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a task force to check the consequences of speculation to the world&#39;s poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the issue is clear, according to one study, 84 percent of Germans do not seem acceptable that banks speculate in agricultural commodities like wheat or corn.
Two thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other lending institutions to withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges drive up prices, and banks bear the responsibility of the global problem of hunger.
The consumer advocate&#39;s campaign is directed specifically to Josef Ackermann, head of Deutsche Bank, although large banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting like.
Originally, bets on commodities were intended to protect traders from price movements.
Leading experts agree that players have been decoupled from the supply and demand, and take profit of the costs of the poor.
Ackermann responded to criticism differently than U.S. competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business &quot;worth compromising the good name of Deutsche Bank.&quot;
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the report claims Foodwatch.
The analysis should be completed later this year, then the results presented to the board of Deutsche Bank, together with a recommendation of how to handle it.
In late January, the bank&#39;s management informed of the consequences.
At the end there could be a reduction in income from raw materials, or even total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to repair his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: &quot;The stakes rising food prices show a particularly drastic how ruthless banks currently harm the public welfare.&quot;
Ackermann is found as the largest banking lobbyist, especially in the obligations.
&quot;Deutsche Bank should withdraw all investments in your portfolio to put in play money to bet food prices,&quot; said Bode.
&quot;No matter whether Ackermann addresses the issue of people going hungry or fame of the Deutsche Bank.&quot;
Inspection of Ackermann surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank reported that the chairman of the board will change something different from the unplanned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of the controversial land speculation can improve its image.
And you need that cares little loss, that will deal with his successor.
Two thirds nullify the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep up the pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users participated in the campaign organization.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 percent considered legitimate for the Deutsche Bank offered investments in which to bet the price of food.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences to discover that his bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two thirds would cancel all investments of the money comes out of land speculation.
43 percent would advise against a bank and their acquaintances, 49 percent would request, upon reflection, cancel your account and change to another school.
The house 21 in Vienna
The flag moved
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A checkered history of architecture and a happy ending, the flag of the Austrian World&#39;s Fair in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, it was empty and collapsed.
Now reopened as a house of exhibitions.
The architecture of modern postgerra passionate, clear shapes, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials typical of the thinking on technical progress, for which the flag Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the Universal Exhibition 1958 Brussels is a good example and known.
Schwanzer Pavilion was then the Grand Prix for Architecture for its light and floating steel and glass construction.
The building is considered to present a landmark of contemporary architecture.
He did so well known architect who also built the flag of Austria in the next world exposition.
With its legendary tower of four cylinders to MBW more flattened an adjacent building in Munich, became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction exhibition arose after the Universal Exhibition in the Schweizer Garten near South Station in Vienna, was reformed in 1962 and opened a museum in the 20th century, was called the &quot;house 20 &quot;.
The building was adequate but lacked the space and technology suitable for a museum, with no wall to hang art, not a good atmosphere.
Although it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building is empty since 2001 and fell more and more.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz renovated hall, now called &quot;house 21&quot; and used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the museum was inaugurated belvedere, which owns the house, with the first exposure, a windfall in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere since 2007, achieved a new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, Ph.D. in art history with a substantial career, among other things, ice skater in her youth, later at Sotheby&#39;s, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, the reforms made to the insistence of politicians and protecting monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established use.
With the exception of contemporary art, will exhibit work by sculptor Fritz Wotruba eponymous foundation, there should be a cafe and a bookstore and also built an office building.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because sensitively renovated secession Olbrichs Joseph in Vienna, expanded and was awarded the contest, but because Schwanzwer studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the flag was for him a &quot;huge and important place,&quot; which looked &quot;almost every weekend&quot; exposures.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his move to Vienna in his generous use change and ease.
In current reforms there are major problems, the building was &quot;a devourer of energy,&quot; said Krischanitz.
Changed the profile of the front windows of glass, insulating glass was installed glass fiber reinforced and replaced the glass ceiling by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements are used for the new use, a panel of light descended from the house and street lighting provides a bridge to enter the building serves almost new, but still the flag of Schwanzer.
Original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in shades of antique mahogany and protected against oxidation.
And the theater is exactly as before.
And all this with a strict control by the office of monuments and a low budget.
&quot;I often had to find material that is good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office,&quot; says Krischanitz and warns of rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
The flag &quot;that came from Brussels&quot; has been difficult, said recently Krischanitz, a typical &quot;casual appearance in the history of the city.&quot;
An architecture and is &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and therefore wanted to &quot;raise adequate awareness.&quot;
In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, it has happened a lucky town. The all new and planned &quot;neighborhood station&quot;, with homes and offices, is situated by the Schweizer Garten.
And maybe another stroke of luck happens: The house 21 could receive a booster Krischanitz another building, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg has purchased the Berlin art gallery and temporary, as it sounds, is negotiating with the city on a neighboring in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a winter crisis package amounting to millions
The company has developed a crisis plan, which would prevent breakdowns of trains in winter.
Should be doubled the number of staff.
What costs millions.
In the fight against failures and delays of trains caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has been spent on this year more than 70 million euros, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper &quot;Bild&quot; reported, citing an internal crisis plan group, planned investments until 2005 a total of around 300 million euros.
For what to get a better availability of vehicles and rail network even with extreme weather.
Among other things, plans to double the internal and external employees to 16,000 jobs to remove snow from roads and sidewalks.
The goal is to clear the sidewalks of snow and ice for the operation and 90 percent of the needles necessary for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of breakdowns and delays on the trains also during this winter after a summit with government and industry.
Deutsche Bahn last winter suffered considerable problems in transporting passengers, since, among other things, lacked reserves to weather conditions.
Many regional trains wait years new authorization from the federal railway office.
In addition there is a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to prove the axes of the high-speed trains often in the workshop, after a high speed train suffered a broken shaft in the central station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank paid millions in fines in the U.S.
After the uproar over President Josef Ackerman, a new problem in the U.S., Deutsche Bank must pay a huge fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for Deutsche Bank, his last in the U.S. acquired by industry giant, the Frankfurt Institute paid $ 145 million (106 million) in an agreement to end the strife caused by the failure of five large credit unions during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial markets regulator criticizes NCUA induce many large banks credit unions with promises to buy financial products have minimized the risks.
These securities lost their value during the financial crisis and banks dragged to the depths.
&quot;We are pleased to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court,&quot; said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank did not admit any fault with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a payment of $ 20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, chairman of the NCUA, held the courtesy to both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for credit unions in the U.S. and supports in bankruptcy to protect customer investments.
The NCUA attempts to reintegrate losses arising million.
The agreements are currently closed his first type.
The regulator had also asked other big banks accountable and summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of the dubious mortgage securities, these are called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the U.S. housing bubble erupted in 2007, led to the downfall of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results followed a few years ago, now wind blows hard for U.S. banks.
Investors and inspection processes have started to receive countless awards and punish offenses.
The Federal Housing Finance (FHFA its acronym in English) has produced the greatest number of demands.
It criticizes the 18 major international banks that the two mortgage agencies Fannie Mae U.S. state and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of about 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank also has a demand of the FHFA, business is valued at 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute responds to &quot;substantial losses&quot;, without naming an exact figure.
The Deutsche Bank rejected as baseless and said debts you want to defend.
Warren Buffett with 10 billion contributing to IBM
The financial guru, Buffett invests heavily in the company of IBM Information Technology.
Since March has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always said not to invest in companies of computers or information technology as it forecasts long-term development of enterprises are negative.
But read the business report from IBM and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
He must understand long before IBM offers services and seeks above all computer systems for the departments of Information Technology of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett investing is considered an honor.
Therefore, the original of Information Technology should be called &quot;Sir IBM.&quot;
Buffett unveiled today at the station CNBC economy that IBM has acquired shares worth 10.7 billion dollars since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investment has risen with it one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that IBM did not know until now none of the commitment.
He praised the address dealt with the ordinary profits in the economic crisis.
&quot;They did a great job,&quot; said Buffett on the strategy.
IBM established for some time the services of Information Technology lucrative operation of computer centers.
The old computer pioneer of over 100 years also provides software and consulting as well as power application equipment for businesses.
Buffett avoided technology companies to date.
He said that only invested in companies whose businesses understand.
Instead, Buffett took the opportunity on a freight train, a manufacturer of lubricants or mechanical engineer.
His Berkshire Hathaway owns about about 80 subsidiaries own and as part of a series of large corporations such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, Munich Re previously.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway in the 60 and, with wise investment, expanded to make it one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, their lifestyle is humble.
That is an idol for many investors around the world.
Its fast and foolproof way to make money has given the nickname &quot;Oracle of Omaha&quot;.
After discovering the Buffett investment, shares of IBM stock rose one percent.
&quot;Big Blue&quot;, as known to IBM, has a market capitalization of more than 220 billion dollars and figure, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, said Buffett, does not work.
Bill Gates, the founder, is a close friend.
The specific threat
Following the discovery of &quot;the cell of Zwickau,&quot; the Turkish media doubt the state of German law.
A newspaper speaks of a &quot;bloody ideology&quot; which again revived.
The murders of eight small business tips and Greeks between 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin have reacted with fear and concern at this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin returns a ghost believed long dead, since the attacks shaped Mölln fire in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there had been more episodes of violence against extreme right background Turks.
However, never has been questioned in Germany there is xenophobia.
The right-wing network discovery reveals a magnitude was not larger, much less predictable.
&quot;Returns to revive the bloody ideology?&quot; He named the online edition of Turkish newspaper &quot;Haberturk&quot;.
The newspaper &quot;Sabah&quot; highlights on the contrary that one of the perpetrators was an informant for the Federal Office of Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-right swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend remembered the victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin with German and Turkish politicians reflected in a solemn ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged in bright colors, like a success story.
The information came to some Turkish media as a slap: &quot;The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary,&quot; says the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform &quot;Having X&quot;, referring to the background of the string of murders.
The German issue &quot;Hürriyet&quot; insists not draw this mental connection.
&quot;It starts to stink,&quot; the title of the column Külahci Ahmet.
Emphasizes that those killed were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution to their work for the reconstruction of Germany.
In Internet forums Turkish German origin, the behavior of the police and their subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors were surprised that the German authorities have not searched long before the circle of suspects in the far right.
Some say the least rhetorical displays about the dramatic media: &quot;From now here is lost, immigrants have no more than self-defense and armaments.&quot;
&quot;This is the best self&quot;.
&quot;The internal peace of Germany depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and appropriateness of the sanction to the entire network.&quot; Type &quot;Selen&quot;.
This means that if the internal peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks in Solingen Mölln and will be clarified in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the fire in Solingen was recorded in German and Turkish memories.
No other event was more clear to the Turks living here that there is a specific threat, and the Germans, that distrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks heightened the feeling of the Turkish group.
Do not repeat past mistakes
The Turkish press was criticized then mainly deficiency of German policy after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refused to visit survivors of Mölln.
After the attack with a fire in Solingen sent a telegram of condolences to Turkish President Klaus Kinkel and his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral of Cologne. Kinkel explained in his speech that contribute taxes Turks in Germany.
It is clear how to calculate the value of a person by the amount of your taxes.
Current information from the Turkish media again shows how deep it is, then, distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the law of this country.
Besides the effort of a full explanation and a revaluation of right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time frank words are needed.
The bank of Lake Zurich scandal
The riskier bank of Europe is in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now led by a German.
Axel Weber certainly had not thought of.
After his dramatic departure from the federal bank summit in July it was reported that in 2013 would begin on a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the board of directors of the major Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber is glad publicly praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for their newfound strength and drop kind comments about their future colleagues.
&quot;The USB has been a revival.&quot;
&quot;I am happy to work with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.&quot;
In September it became clear that everything would be totally different.
A financial trader in London prevented all USB security systems and defrauded the bank 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, CEO of USB, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to go.
The chairman of the board of the USB since it was considered equally touched, and all asked: When does Axel Weber?
It was learned that Weber must advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the presidency of the board of directors in May, not early 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
There is a banker, rather, a professor of economics and advisor and has been an adjustment period probably necessary.
Suddenly responsible for the strategy of a bank, you just try again deserves the title &quot;the biggest bank scandal of Europe&quot; in a while.
First, the USB is huge, until recently was the largest global asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, glides to the next scandal.
Nothing, so it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
Financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of discreet Swiss asset manager and solid, but also cunning, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number of investment banks.
First, with 1.6 billion dollars, the USB manages more money wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, advanced as an investment bank in the league of the big banks in the world.
This impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later a professor of banking at Zurich for many years, explains: &quot;With my students, I have always qualified to the USB as a model of a good bank.&quot;
&quot;From the point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?&quot;
It was a big mistake.
In 2007 came to light that something went very wrong with the USB.
This summer, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a great and very smart banker, surprisingly resigned.
Some months later, the suspected reason.
The bank&#39;s investment fund losses embarked on subprime securities and had to repay billions.
To carry this, USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this, investors found naturally looked with some contempt until shortly before: Asian background and opaque state of Singapore and a state fund Arabic, so discreet, that he had never heard his name.
This was only the first blow.
In April 2008, worsened.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board, in 2006 the second highest paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, continued the disaster, given the wrong investment, UBS was found in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank purchased troubled assets to UBS for many thousands of millions, the Helvetic Confederation given six thousand francs a mandatorily convertible bond, by becoming part owner of the bank.
All Switzerland was affected, said the drama that this was for a small country, if you are hosting such large banks.
Finally, total assets of UBS in 2007 was more than five times higher than Switzerland&#39;s economic performance (see graph).
&quot;We can not go to rescue UBS,&quot; said Geiger, banking expert.
The first catastrophe joined the latter.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and was willing to deliver rich customer data, possibly using tax had defrauded the bank.
In addition, approve a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unjustified benefits of these businesses with a severance payment.
This, UBS admitted helping more or less in tax fraud.
Simultaneously lost something that had always been their capital in the competition for wealthy clients: the aura of discretion.
After the scandal, Swiss bank secrecy is no longer the same.
This followed the resignation of the president of the board and the chairman of the board.
And the exodus of client funds.
Thus, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two core sectors: in investment banking with erroneous speculation and asset management with the help of tax fraud.
And just when it was again something quieter, just when you thought that UBS again to get it, it happens this unhappy history of the operator, an individual trader defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And he revealed, apparently, this still does not work well with the management of risk in investment banking.
&quot;With case manifests Adoboli risk that the controls have changed too little,&quot; said Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute, University of Zurich.
The CFO of a large German bank is also certain: &quot;The problem is that UBS does not dominate risk controls.&quot;
So the idea of ​​caution, with which Swiss bankers had in a while, being guardians of the greater good of the world, no risk too great, however, the safety of money you want to break across the Alpine republic.
Security deposits from Swiss banks were the symbol of unwavering reliability, Lindt and Sprüngli as real chocolate.
The centerpiece of the UBS in Zurich does not fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, just a little older.
The situation is a classic.
The bank is headquartered in Zurich Bahnhofstrasse, which runs from the main station directly into the lake of Zurich, framed by snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here are ostentatious buildings, rents are among the highest in Europe.
Here are jewelers like Tiffany `s between traditional businesses such as confectionery Sprüngli Swiss.
Live here for years Swiss banks: from the national bank, to Credit Suisse&#39;s palace, to the private banks elitarios as Julius Bär.
You enter the lobby of the UBS by a heavy revolving door.
Within the walls are lined with marble, in front are large leather chairs, next to the bank&#39;s logo is a big sign to indicate the &quot;security&quot;.
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Safety.
The two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse have been displaced at some point the idea of ​​the major Swiss bank, or betrayed, and writes the president of a small Swiss private bank.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all do, like all Swiss bankers, also with businesses both large banks.
The UBS has become too big, says, mainly in investment banking, where whites have gained ground.
That the Swiss had nothing more to say.
&quot;And they have long become accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot;
In fact, the UBS investment banking changed the Anglo-Saxon, gave his first big win and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost so much money in the jungle of high risk as the major Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was clear.
&quot;That Wednesday the coalition government of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation,&quot; writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;Der UBS-Crash&quot; (&quot;The crash of the UBS&quot; in Spanish .)
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do you think of?
He speaks with Swiss bankers, and see the problem in the dimension of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merge in a powerful consortium.
There is a bank that due to the merger, was too big for the little Switzerland, and growing.
As served to the two different precursors banks UBS complement: a bank rich but stayed with the center of asset management in Zurich and internationalization poorer but stronger.
Suddenly, internationalized investment banks came in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a financial bike.
There are two names connected with this rise in UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the consortium of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.
&quot;I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,&quot; said banking expert Hans Geiger.
&quot;Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, which means a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, who got the intuitive learning their way from the bank to the summit.&quot;
Finally, he relied on Wuffli Ospel.
And at the end Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake: &quot;He thought that their models were a reality,&quot; says Geiger.
&quot;It&#39;s a tragic case.&quot;
Tragic, perhaps.
Is clear: The folly of the case came before.
UBS employees clearly remember the board meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeating the same slogan: Get off the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
Topped the &quot;League Tables&quot;, rankings then documented the success of banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the top.
Some steps will go well.
In currency trading and stock trading was at the top.
However, responsible management consultants highlighted a weakness in the business of international interest in the language of banking &quot;fixed income&quot;, there is a huge compensation for the big banks.
The UBS has gaps in the American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an affair that almost cost him his life.
Hungry for growth, invested much the same bank as one of its hedge funds created in high-risk U.S. investments.
It became a powerful machine to securitize mortgages and sell them to Americans then maintaining certain risks to themselves.
Also, as banks sought the long descent.
&quot;In the summer of 2007, as the U.S. housing market was on fire, UBS bought there,&quot; said Geiger, banking expert.
So great euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave because the attempt to order proved more complicated than expected.
UBS posts in the seats became unsafe and are projectable to the present.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, to which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banking, has an idea, put an end to investment banking, focusing on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking should be greatly reduced, it is clear now.
The following Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new bank president, will present its future strategy to the world.
In fact, only thought of the Italian-Swiss 51 years as a temporary solution, since the bank broke the bank of his predecessor surprisingly Grübel.
Meanwhile, he won: You must run permanently the business of UBS, the bank in Zurich on Tuesday.
Ermotti want to return to the investment bank to its mid-nineties.
Deletes 3,500 jobs.
But this is not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What would you like to earn money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is safe now.
So far only said that first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
The following year.

Smart crows spread in cities
In many places the jays are considered &quot;problem birds&quot; not eject these highly intelligent animals of the city for a long time, experts say.
A few like them, very quickly want to get rid of them, the rooks years belong to the image of the city, but in many municipalities collect complaints from neighbors for the mess and noise of the animals.
Although there have been no means against the &quot;bird problem&quot; so far.
Rooks do not leave the cities, experts say the first symposium on crows in Leer, East Frisia.
There, specialists from around the country discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in the cities
Environmentalists attribute the problems of the cities to rural migration of certain protected rooks, chemical applications in agriculture, just visible with traditional living space.
Hunting, rising and falling buildings that host trees make life difficult for the birds.
The rooks are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, including in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, and Read.
There in 2005 made headlines negative press a controversial project to kill the crows flock to the district.
Critics have described the hunting of animals by trapping and killing birds with sticks as particularly brutal.
&quot;Expelling and driving them away normally not achieved anything,&quot; said Werner Klover, urban planner and landscape of Reading.
Water to shoot down the trees or nests are usually unintended consequences, also says Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert of Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
&quot;Animals are diverted, large colonies are divided and distributed in other places.&quot;
Scaring imaginable only as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
&quot;We must live with them, and not catch them.&quot;
Without the surrounding area, does not solve the problem in cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Reading.
It is possible a combination of repelling animals from residential areas and sensitive baits for re-settle elsewhere.
&quot;Information boards rather than chain saws&quot; Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertising against in order to treat animals in a totally different: &quot;The best thing is that we can take a peak in the face with aplomb. &quot;
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein on the teaching circuit of Ascheberger rooks, where signs provide information about the lives of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has their own opinion about the criticism by the sound of the birds: &quot;All are forms of communication, have much to say.&quot;
The intelligence and ability of these animals are legendary, the rooks not only use the resources to access snacks shale, but it made tools for use as resources.
Recently, ethologists, University of Cambridge in four rooks tested how far the intelligence of birds.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned to be dropping a stone on a platform in order to achieve a moth larva.
Without much training, recognized in determining the size and form it should take the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the crafty crows had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach its prey with its beak.
But the researchers left a piece of wire.
In the four animals formed a hook, which caught the cube on the handle of the tube.
Three of the four rooks did so on the first try.

Slaughter personally
The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, The beauty and pain of battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about the First World War, &quot;begins with a lengthy dramatis personae of the type that can make it a drop your heart sink.
Here are some acting tips: Start gently this page and make it your bookmarks.
Get to know these people very well in the narrative fiction of Mr. Englund, and the dramatis personae will function as your GPS, a beacon for those few moments when, as one of its men and women, is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish journalist and historian.
It is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
What is written here is a rare book, which describes aptly as &quot;a work of anti-history.&quot;
It contains some notable names, major treaties or famous battles, virtually no ambassadors, journalists and elegant discussing tactics or material.
Not so much a book about what happened, he explains, &quot;a book about how it happened.&quot; It is about &quot;feelings, impressions, experiences and moods.&quot;
&quot;The beauty and pain of battle&quot; combines the wartime experiences of about 20 ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanical climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative staff.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, or lose their members, will go crazy or die.
Their lives here as votive candles flicker on in a church a few new ones are added to the mixture while others go out.
The book of Mr. Englund is a deviation from the standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was the only fatal trench warfare on the Western Front.
&quot;The beauty and pain of battle&quot; moves expertly through other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book will fall on the hives, one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids, the tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is a poignant, almost from the beginning.
The war engulfs the lives of these people as a natural disaster, hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordite.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you&#39;re a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or flee?
Anyway who is?
Almost no one understands what is happening, why even have to fight this war.
&quot;Lack of facts,&quot; says Mr. Englund, &quot;is filled with speculation, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.&quot;
&quot;The beauty and pain of battle&quot; is individuals like Florence Farmborough, a British nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor in the fleet at sea.
Their stories have been obtained mostly from memoirs, letters and other material already published.
The explanations of their lives can be frightening or disturbing, but they are more lively in the accumulation of small moments, lost detail, Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about hardship and cope with what is.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says: &quot;Substitutes, substitutes everywhere.&quot;
&quot;Substitute coffee, aluminum false, imitation rubber, bands of paper, wood buttons.&quot;
Keep talking ersatz food in Germany.
Described &quot;meat made from cooked rice and mutton fat pressed (and topped with a bone made from wood false); snuff made from roots and dried potato peelings, shoes with wooden soles.&quot;
There, he observes, &quot;837 allowed meat substitutes in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes.&quot;
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse toward savagery and shows about the war: &quot;You feel like, after all, this is what men are conceived and not to sit in chairs with a cigar and a whiskey, newspaper afternoon or a best seller, and pretend that this veneer means civilization and that there is a barbarian behind the front crisp and studded. &quot;
But a British soldier realizes that probably will die, and nobody will know or will care.
&quot;Once one is resigned to the thought of sacrifice, one would like to think that could happen before the public,&quot; he writes.
Instead, it is awfully similar &quot;to a condemned secretly being strangled.&quot;
Other observations are about a dying old Europe, and on new types of terror.
&quot;The conflict has become increasingly economic competition,&quot; writes Mr. Englund, &quot;a war between factories.&quot;
Reflects the arrival of what he calls &quot;a new species in the bestiary of the young century: the mass murderer ideologically convinced eloquent and good clothes clothing running his butcher shop while sitting behind a desk.&quot;
People behave in unexpected ways, so much ignoble behavior as heroic.
Mr. Englund talks about the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way of evading service in the front.
&quot;The grotesque expression of this can be seen gonococcal pus trade, the soldiers bought and smear their genitals thereby hoping to end up in the hospital,&quot; he writes.
&quot;Those who are truly desperate to rub it over his eyes, which often leads to blindness for life.&quot;
In this translation of the Swedish made by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr. Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to its human task.
In dozens of short scenes reflects the way in which the war &quot;unleashed forces exceptionally uncontrollable extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred&quot;.
People begin to ask why their leaders are doing to combat.
The best books about World War have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Modern Memory by Paul Fussell, or novels like All Quiet on the front of Erich Maria Remarque, rather than comprehensive stories.
The volume of Mr. Englund joins a pantheon unconventional.
His book has one of the most devastating late I can remember in a work of nonfiction.
Do not tell.
But it is as if he had come from his book, torn between your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and been burned with a match.
After a preliminary misstep, an assault planned to the minute
Hundreds of police were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
Was chosen Monday night to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be empty.
The operation was kept secret except to a few senior officers, initially telling others that they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the center, their presence underscored how the operation was plagued with challenges for the police department.
There were repeated episodes of recent weeks, as the spraying of pepper spray on demonstrators in violation of department rules and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the &quot;squatters&quot;.
And so the police operation to clear the protesters Zuccotti Park was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents were prepared watching occupations had developed in other cities.
A major disaster drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye toward Zuccotti.
The agents called training increased the disorders - involving counter-terrorism measures quickly mobilize large numbers of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night in the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders came into the park in the &quot;last minute&quot;, said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as &quot;an exercise&quot;.
&quot;A few cops I know who were called to this, they said it was to enter the park Zuccotti,&quot; said the person, who spoke anonymously.
&quot;The only people who knew they would enter the park Zuccotti were at the highest levels of the department.&quot;
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, agents wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged soon after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday&#39;s operation involved police officers from various units, including special forces around the borough - dozens of mobile agents usually used to flood the neighborhoods with high crime rate.
Mr. Kelly said many people as those who commute to work, had been coming and going of the park during the day, by 1 am a good time to enter.
&quot;It was appropriate to do so when was the lowest number of people in the park,&quot; he said.
Trucks of the Emergency Services Unit with lights and speakers gathered at the intersection of Pike Slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and prerecorded messages that echoed from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community Affairs Officers went to the park with his blue windbreaker, many protesters simply packed up and left.
Do not touch any store until 1:45 am, police said, allowing time for protesters to gather their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering on the perimeter to come if needed to make arrests in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon it.
Paul J. Browne, chief spokesman of the Police Department, said it was for their safety.
But many journalists said they tried to prevent the police saw into action in the park, and had been treated roughly by the agents.
Mr. Browne said the television mobile units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, they captured images.
As the police moved westward through the dense tangle of personal effects of the protesters, including baggage and garbage bags of paper and plastic packed with clothing, equipment Cleaning Department followed, picking up what is left behind.
Some protesters refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly thereafter.
A core group of protesters took up positions near the camp kitchen area near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came to arrest them methodically.
Around 10 people at the center of the camp candaron between them by the arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
The emergency service officers were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 am, said Mr. Kelly.
The clearing operation was completed 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for &quot;disorderly conduct and resisting arrest,&quot; he said.
The highest ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the chief of detectives of the department, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while he was present, &quot;was not directing operations,&quot; said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents expected along the east side of Broadway between Liberty and Cedar streets, where they had to enter.
Barricades were erected in Cortlandt Street, one block north of the park, and on Pine Street, one block south.
From these positions, the police was extending beyond the perimeter of the park even Zuccotti.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were 28 people on the northern perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 am, south of Pine Street, one protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing the air from the wheel of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out from the crowd.
Finally, an agent and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The support workers union will sue the city for layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, saying the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of its disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
Demand is possibly the last weapon available to the union, municipal district 37, in an effort to overturn the dismissals.
Six hundred seventy and two assistants from the school, parent coordinators and others who were among the lowest paid of the city lost their jobs on October 7, in a move that union leaders have described as a political revenge for his refusal to permit last spring, the access of the city to fund health care by working groups to close its budget gap.
Municipal authorities have categorically denied the accusation.
At a hearing at City Hall last month, the Minister of Education, Dennis M. Walcott, said the layoffs were part of the budget approved in June.
A board member countered by saying that nothing in the budget specified that the support staff of the school would be dismissed.
37 borough officials said they filed the complaint in writing, advising the Department of Education would be sued. He held a press conference Wednesday to announce the official launch of the application, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The demand will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education as defendants the city, and has eight employees dismissed as plaintiffs, all black or Latino women, like most of the attendees who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the city Law Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on their specific claims.
According to a draft obtained by The demand New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more attendees, and that had been chronically under-funded.
It is noted that although there were no layoffs in Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools on the Upper East Side and TriBeCa, 17 school aides lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were dismissed in District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint says, &quot;This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit. &quot;
P. S. 36 The district&#39;s budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year and also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the additional funding for each student enrollment by poor schools.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by the language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memo used the word &quot;surplus&quot; to describe the action, although &quot;over&quot; more often describes the act of transferring a payroll master of a school to a job whose salaries are paid by the office center.
&quot;Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired,&quot; the draft complaint, &quot;not only over&quot;.
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya
Seems to have finally Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was that the rebellion is successful, the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed, and the U.S. involvement ended.
On Tuesday, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (D-Mass.), along with Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent-CT), applauded the Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for his &quot;courage.&quot;
&quot;This resolution is to honor the brave of Libya, to begin to rebuild their country,&quot; Kerry said.
&quot;It is a statement of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.&quot;
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties were fighting each other and with the White House on the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide margin bipartisan, and that never came to a vote in the Senate.
But the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the chamber also rejected a measure that would cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission a sort of legislative purgatory - with Congress angry enough to criticize the handling by Obama of the mission, but not so angry as to actually mow the grass under his feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell to the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the House Foreign Affairs Committee &quot;congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves&quot; and &quot;commends the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States and its coalition partners participating in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism. &quot;
The resolution also &quot;declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.&quot;
Will he win the new measure the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or divide legislators as the bill made in June?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the top Republican on the committee.
Place spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
Across the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all congressional Republicans and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), is the first constitutional amendment on the budget or anything else that actually achieves a vote of the entire assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other lawmakers have failed so far to get their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of trying.
The Goodlatte is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicates - the same bill was proposed in both the House and Senate - and others with slight variations between them.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment in the House only, and another handful that &quot;control federal spending.&quot;
Some of those bills are also identical, but give their sponsors - especially rookies Republicans seeking to refine their resumes - the opportunity to boast that they were the &quot;authors&quot; of the measure.
The Budget Control Act, adopted in August, required both the House and the Senate voted a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted for a nonbinding resolution supporting the idea of ​​such amendment.
Beyond the budget, members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can accomplish, while Rep. Jose E. Serrano (DN.Y.) wants to remove the two term limit for presidents.
Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and healthcare, among others.
An amendment banning gay marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as prohibiting flag burning.
Some lawmakers also want to permit the setting aside of federal law, if rejected by two thirds of the states.
As enthusiasts who have been members in proposing the amendments are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and had 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990&#39;s, when members regularly had more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But there were far more successful then than they do now.
The last amendment was added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact was proposed by Congress in 1789.
&quot;Beaten but not defeated,&quot; Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him at close range in an act constituting in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) appeared on national television Monday night, he sang accompanied by Broadway Melody &quot;The sun will rise tomorrow&quot; and said he wanted to get more than they wanted to return to Congress.
Appearing on ABC News &quot;20/20&quot; with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The program documented her difficult road back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that passage from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, came as a surprise to the House to vote on the agreement of successful debt ceiling.
In his first television interview since the shooting in January, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as &quot;difficult.&quot;
When Sawyer asked how he feels, Giffords, 41, said: &quot;Pretty good.&quot;
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special &quot;20/20&quot; of an hour, which aired the day before the publication of the couple&#39;s new book, &quot;Gabby: A story of courage and hope. &quot;
The special program analyzed the recovery of Giffords from the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first weeks, she looks in her hospital bed, his head shaved and a long scar across his forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers erect, while her husband encourages her.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach you how to perform simple actions.
A nod.
A puckering of the lips.
And then, his first word: &quot;What&quot;.
Within days, Giffords spoke another word - &quot;Toast&quot;, a change request in its breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC shows that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: Congresswoman is seen singing along with the therapists the songs &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot; by Cyndi Lauper and &quot;Free Falling&quot; by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, which does two hours of therapy every day, said he remembers the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading to Giffords a newspaper article about the murder on March 12 when she stopped to ask first about the six who had died in the incident.
The gunman suspect, Jared Lee Loughner, has been detained in a prison in Missouri and is being medicated by force while awaiting trial.
&quot;Many people died,&quot; Giffords said Sawyer.
&quot;Hard, hard, hard.&quot;
Kelly told Sawyer that in a time of recovery of his wife, she said: &quot;I have been defeated.&quot;
&quot;So I said,&quot; &#39;Gabby, you have not been defeated,&#39; &quot;said Kelly.
&quot;I just have been beaten.
And you&#39;ll get through this, and you&#39;ll recover and come back stronger than ever. &quot;
The troops are felt more pity than respect
The gala event was a Wall Street raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines burst into their seats around him.
The tag crowd stood and applauded.
&quot;Men and women were regarded as heroes,&quot; said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A senior military official at the gala, also known as the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops in different ways.
&quot;The show as a kind of orphan,&quot; the official wrote in an email.
I am sure that the organizers had good intentions.
It they did.
But there was respect, really. It was pity.
The sharply conflicting views illustrate the difficult relationship that military has seized the American public and often distant, sometimes worshiper.
Is lavished with praise troops for their sacrifices.
But the praise has a price, say the service members.
The public increasingly acts as if given pity those in uniform.
&quot;We are not victims at all,&quot; said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will soon depart.
&quot;But it seems that the only way to show some support is put us in the role of helpless souls.&quot;
The issue is a sensitive issue for military leaders, who want to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that anger to which the troops fought back in recent years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, most pity talks are conducted quietly and in private among veterans.
After her two children returned to combat with the Marine Corps, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned that people would consider apart from the military service from two perspectives.
Some would regard them with a feeling of fear because it clashed with insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others wonder if there would be a &quot;veteran angry and violent beneath the surface,&quot; said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in high-level government in Washington.
During your job search, said he felt that some interviewers had asked him gently if he could hold up under the pressure of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his tour of combat.
&quot;When you talk about your service, you need to address the negative perceptions,&quot; recalled Cancian by telling their children.
Military concern arises, in part, of American indifference to the wars.
The achievements in the field are rarely selected for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and see little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
&quot;We as a nation, no longer value the military heroism in ways that were quite common in the Second World War,&quot; said Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, praise from politicians and the public are focused largely on the depth of suffering of a service member.
The troops are recognized by the number of tours that have endured, the number of friends who have lost or extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to end the violation
This week, a historic hearing will decide if 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity in the violation.
If not, hundreds of applicants are being organized for the next.
Private First Elizabeth Lyman was 25 and 11 weeks of pregnancy the night in which she says she was raped by a teammate.
It was October 2008 and was headed back to his headquarters in Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who had a pack of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
&quot;It sounded an alarm,&quot; says Lyman.
However, the native Texan put aside their concerns.
I thought, no, is 19.
&quot;It&#39;s Texas,&quot; he says.
&quot;I wish I had listened to my instincts.&quot;
Within minutes of entering the room of Lyman, the man approached her from behind, knocking her down and raping her, he says.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other members of current and former military personnel are eagerly awaiting a court decision in a landmark trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether the lawsuit have been filed against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread rape in the military, in violation of constitutional rights of soldiers.
Launched in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, DC, demand initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them say they were raped or sexually assaulted by their partners, and that the army it failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says he will by the staff of the army, because the problem starts with them.
&quot;The army is a top-down structure,&quot; he says.
&quot;Who are the people who are able to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The high command.&quot;
Burke also said that since February, have been in contact with about 400 survivors, many of which could be part of future demands.
His strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all your eggs in one basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, headed by Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
Court documents obtained by Newsweek, detailing the strategy of defense, in essence, that the military can not be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries suffered in the armed forces.
For a Supreme Court decision in 1950 called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for damages suffered by active duty personnel.
&quot;The alleged damages are part of the military service of the plaintiffs,&quot; the documents say.
The Defense Department declined to comment for this article.
Things have changed since the 50&#39;s.
While women are still officially banned them serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 female soldiers have died and two thirds of them in combat situations.
It is time to modernize the army also says Burke.
She is not alone in their struggle, and three other lawsuits are under way, as well as yours.
At Yale Law School, Legal Clinic for Veterans Services is preparing a case against the four main military academies to foster an environment for allegedly misogynist.
Moreover, the nonprofit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a lawsuit against the army that focuses on the diagnosis of &quot;personality disorder&quot; assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them of Service - a common occurrence, according to activists, as Anu Bhagwati Action Network of Women in Service, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles claims for benefits for people who say they were sexually assaulted in the service.
There have been nine separate bills in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010 there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, Department of Defense.
However, the attacks are significantly below reported, and the Pentagon&#39;s own estimates, which amounts to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the processing rates: in 2010, 20 percent of reported cases in the army went to trial - half that of the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the case of Burke, described their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
For Lyman, reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he says, was asked to tell the details of her rape 11-fold different from a crowd of policemen, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of her attacker, a cut on his arm was found in his bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he asked about who had had sex with her boyfriend the day of the attack.
Six people testified as witnesses on behalf personality of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
&quot;I remember the day when the verdict was read,&quot; says Lyman.
&quot;I thought I was going to work, I ran screaming from the room.&quot;
&quot;They put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I came, I remember that I told my commanding officer,&quot; &quot;That was not his judgment. That was my judgment.&quot;
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed with a personality disorder, which made them unfit for service.
In January 2010, was exempted from service under a less-than-honorable, so you can not receive any benefits.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his colleagues demand continues, it&#39;s a long shot, said John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, &quot;In my opinion, should be able to move on.&quot;
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I&#39;ve been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it has the same incentive and deterrence raises the risk.
He adds: &quot;The odds are heavily against them ... but it&#39;s important for them to try.&quot;
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If no hearing is on its way, Burke, attorney for the plaintiffs, the tail will make his other hundreds of applicants for future cases.
&quot;We will continue fighting against the army in this issue for the reform to occur,&quot; he says.
&quot;Or until we die, whichever comes first.
The walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Breivik Behring was just another guy who aerated their views online anti-immigration.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to making a killing in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, he faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time preceding his attack against your computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups in networks social.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - just log into Facebook.
&quot;We realized that was not so difficult to reach,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett, author of a recently published report on the digital populism Europe DEMOS British research center.
The cache of personal information Facebook is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their demographic characteristics desired with scientific precision - the way that marketers have been using for years.
Bartlett&#39;s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups throughout Europe and then I went advertisements, but instead link them to a new band or diet product, the ads invite users to complete a survey that asked about educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their future.
Arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 fans from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
&quot;It&#39;s a whole new way of doing research,&quot; says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: The online supporters of right wing groups tend to be young men and angry about immigration.
However, in a kind of rotation, &quot;those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen.&quot;
DEMOS work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health problems such as social trends are in the &quot;Like&quot;, messages on the walls and status updates.
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content daily, the &quot;supernova data&quot; Facebook is creating a boom in research, boosting the number of academic papers with the site name in the title to almost 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that you can study the people who could not get close to a folder on the street.
&quot;Before, when people were trying to survey the British National Party, was very difficult to identify.&quot;
&quot;You&#39;d have to go through the game, and they never allow you access,&quot; says Bartlett.
&quot;Facebook removes all that - go to them directly.&quot;
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and colleagues found that college students who discussed their drunken exploits on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having a drinking problem that students remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential advisors, could control the site and intervene to help a student to publish too many status updates with their drinking.
&quot;You can not treat a problem if you can not diagnose,&quot; said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development of Children in the Children&#39;s Research Institute Seattle, the Washington Post.
&quot;We found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise not be diagnosed.&quot;
Facebook is also constantly &quot;clicking&quot; their own population to obtain data.
The Data Team has developed site statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine&#39;s Day, the expected turnout in the middle of the legislative period of 2010 and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that is accessible - Digital freedom advocates have long maintain that the site should make available to its many other research data).
However, users of Facebook know that the site is watching over them, like it or not - the sacrifice to play Scrabble with a friend to thousands of miles away is to allow the mine site your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey do not even know?
While researchers have clear guidelines on how to collect your data offline, online is an open bar for everyone.
&quot;I do not think many users have even thought that a researcher might be looking at their profiles,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab on a 2006 study conducted with the walls Facebook public students.
&quot;As they were concerned, was just between them and their friends.&quot;
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic that being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know which part of the information a user profile and wall posts are true.
&quot;What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,&quot; says Selwyn.
That&#39;s why, despite his years as a researcher of technology, Selwyn believes a clipboard and pen are still the best research tools that anyone can use.
&quot;There is no substitute to enter the real world and talk to real people,&quot; he says.
&quot;Social research is supposed to be about the social - and a lot of the social still happens offline.&quot;
&quot;Cold and inhuman: Anders Breivik Behring made his first public appearance in court
Behring Anders Breivik, the man who confessed to masterminding two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter of &quot;resistance&quot; during his first public appearance at the court of Oslo.
&quot;I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights Templar of Norway,&quot; he told a room filled with 500 people.
&quot;I oppose the court, having received the mandate of the organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.&quot;
&quot;I recognize the facts but I plead guilty.&quot;
The judge interrupted Breivik Torkjel Nesheim during the monologue, because &quot;Breivik wanted to give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express their views.&quot;
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, go to the families of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik custody for 12 weeks, barred access to the media for four weeks, and said officials would need to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks .
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look in the eyes Breivik, other to confirm that he is being held under lock and key.
They all attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
&quot;I thought it looked cold and inhuman,&quot; a survivor of the station Utoya Norwegian NRK.
&quot;It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect.&quot;
Wearing a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked to journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered and left the building.
Despite the strange notion of Breivik to be part of a movement of &quot;resistance&quot; greater, the judge determined that there is mentally ill, and said there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
It is possible that some people comfort that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist group rather than a radical.
But that does not automatically softens the pain and confusion that still feels a whole nation.
&quot;I&#39;d look like a monster, but it seems,&quot; said a relative of a victim.
&quot;It would be much easier if you wished.&quot;
7 Lessons from the loss of Steve Jobs interview are shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs, on 5 October, there were those who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Inventor Modern.
But what Apple fans might find it more revealing, in an interview recently rediscovered Jobs which has been dusted off in advance of a series of special screenings in major markets this week, how many understand the creative mind of the processes commercial workflow products.
It was definitely a designer, dreamer and autorreconocido hippie, but he was a meticulous organizer and a junkie flow diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffered &quot;a disease that is a great idea to think that is 90 percent work ... [but] there is an enormous amount of work from a great idea and a great product. &quot;
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds (Triumph of the Idiots) on the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for over an hour with Jobs for a long, strange conversation.
At that time barely 10 years had passed since Jobs was forced out of Apple, and I worked hard on his new NeXT computer company, hoping the popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview was used in Nerds Cringely said that the originals of the interview disappeared during transport.
It was only after Jobs&#39; death it was discovered a complete copy on VHS in the garage of the director.
This footage, slightly re-edited, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, 68 minutes, which hits theaters this Wednesday and Thursday Landmark.
For someone known to hate the interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points throughout the interview, there are long silences between questions and answers - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs is weighing his thoughts clearly, for accuracy.
There are also times when Jobs&#39; perfectionism comes to the surface, where it seems impatient with questions Cringely, pushing him to go faster or arguments to the issues of greatest importance.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there&#39;s something strangely prophetic in Lost Interview, when Jobs assess what other companies do you see good and evil, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
One thing to read reviews posthumous career of Jobs, but there is something raw and inspiring in the Jobs that we see here, the anxious dreamer on the verge of greatness.
He has a vision of how they can and should do things.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, was and did.
A quick summary of seven sequences notable loss Interview:
Learned how to run a business:
&quot;Over the years in the business, I always wondered:&quot; &quot;Why do things?&quot; and the answers you get will invariably are: &quot;Oh, that&#39;s just the way it does.&quot;
Nobody knows why he does what he does in business no one thinks very deeply about things.
That&#39;s what I found.
Jobs leads to detail their efforts to simplify the accounting for Apple.
Puzzled by the way costs are recorded - often starting with a &quot;standard cost&quot; that was done by guesswork, and then fit with a &quot;variable&quot; - developed an automated factory assuring that could determine the costs retail trade.
Joke about the Pope:
Jobs tells the &quot;Blue Box&quot; that he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hack the phone company and effectively make free long distance calls.
He has written extensively about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here to describe the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
Wozniak describes how he tested the box and using a pay phone, a call, and then connecting from a network of AT &amp; T to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
&quot;We were wrapping things around the world a half dozen times and shouted through the phone and returned a minute later the phone the next door,&quot; Jobs says with a chuckle.
&quot;We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that would control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.&quot;
We both did not know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson, and I do not think Apple would never have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak with the Pope while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the Pope himself was awakened to go to answer the phone.
On a fascination with technology (and selling over the phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 years, hunting for parts to build a frequency counter, looked at Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs got a summer job part-time at Hewlett-Packard.
&quot;That was a remarkable influence on me, was the only company that had been formed at that age and my vision of what was a company and how well they treated their employees.&quot;
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw &quot;the first desktop computer ever made.&quot;
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode ray tube screen, and I loved it.
Get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for it.
Improvise on innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
Early in his career, as he sold a handful of motherboards, a customer asked if he could assemble the entire team.
Working with only 30 days credit, had to figure out the assembly and delivery of finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, remember the struggles they faced in the development of a computer mouse:
&quot;I remember having arguments dramatic ... I cried it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $ 300], and I got fed up and went outside and found a designer.
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $ 15 and it was totally reliable.
On large companies losing steam:
Long before Warren led the revival of Apple, Jobs prophetically foresaw the way many industry leaders stumble in their vision, and lose control of their market share.
&quot;Say you work at IBM or Xerox, for what you do best copiers and printers, so what?&quot;
You have the monopoly of the market share, making the company more successful.
The sales and increase marketing success, so they are such people who end for leading companies and makers of the products are expelled from the forum for decision making.
The genius of the products that led to such monopoly rots because of people who have no notion of good vs. bad products products - knowledge of the trade necessary.
That&#39;s what happened at Xerox ...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, could have been the Microsoft of the 90 ...
They took the defeat of victory.
On innovation and artistic expression:
&quot;There is an enormous amount of work from a great idea and a great product as it evolves ... great idea, it changes and grows.&quot;
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to do - some things you can not make them do the electrons, the glass makes the robots do the same, the factories make.
You have to keep things in your brain 5000 - these concepts - fit all at once ...
In the end it comes down to taste - is reduced to trying to expose you to the best human team has done, and then try to adapt those things that you&#39;re doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have never been ashamed about stealing great ideas.
What in part made the Macintosh great was that people were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, which coincidentally were the best computer scientists in the world.
If not for the computer, you may be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with the opponents of health care law while the court takes the case
The day the Supreme Court met in closed session to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether they would accept the challenge to the law of President Obama&#39;s health care, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were invited to a dinner sponsored by the law firm setting out the case before the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine justices met in a preliminary hearing to pore over petitions for review.
One case in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the total reform of health care passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists across the country.
The justices agreed to admit the claim and, in fact, it is hoped a plea historic 5 hours to March, and the result is likely to further vitiate the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court&#39;s decision is known.
The attorney will appear in court and allege that the law should be scrapped will probably Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during the George W. Bush.
The law firm of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has long been dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, representing a trade association that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the preliminary hearing the court on the case.
Among those attending were, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican most important in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of health care law.
Are the special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It&#39;s nothing new: The two judges have been attending the Federalist Society events for years.
And it&#39;s not something that conflicts with the ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they are not, you could say that would fall under Canon 4C Code, which states: &quot;A judge may attend fund raising events for organizations concerned with law and others, although the judge can not be a speaker, a guest of honor or included in the agenda of the event. &quot;
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two law firms in the case, and a company with a huge financial interest was enough to alarm advocates of ethics in government.
&quot;This impressive gap of ethics and disregard for the code goes against the demands of various court judges who abide by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause (Cause Common).
&quot;The judges were thrown a fundraising gala with attorneys who have cases pending before the court.&quot;
His appearance and assist in fundraising for this event undermines any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the criticism that too easily mixed court activity with the agenda promoted by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas&#39;s wife, Ginni, is a leading conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is the judge Elena Kagan, which has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan served as solicitor general of the Obama administration when it presented the first legal challenges to the law in court.
His critics have pressed for Kagan refrain from seeing the case, saying he was too involved in defending the law to be impartial now.
Kagan has not given any indication that they will do.
Boeing received an order record 18 billion dollars
The airline called Emirates 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777, with an option for 20 more.
Boeing also sells six aircraft to Oman Air Boeing Dreamliner, a deal worth over a billion dollars.
Rarely is news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product.
But it is a transaction where the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 aircraft amounted to a record 18 billion dollars.
Is as large as the place where Boeing was ordered: Middle East, a gold mine for future growth in aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years in the Middle East airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion dollars.
Boeing announced at the weekend its largest order ever for commercial aircraft by dollar value - 50 jets Boeing twin-aisle 777.
The successful request came from the Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 aircraft, which would raise the total sales price of $ 26 billion, Boeing announced at the Dubai Air Show 2011.
Then on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, called the Dreamliner, which boasts a fuel economy and better services for passengers spectacular.
The sale price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
&quot;This is clearly a huge positive impact for Boeing,&quot; said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
&quot;The quality of these customers in particular is very strong.&quot;
Many Middle Eastern airlines are property of their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually detrimental to the airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not as harmful, because the country is making money with the rising price of oil.
That&#39;s important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay orders for flight when fuel prices rise, said Dihora.
&quot;They have a natural protection,&quot; he said.
The order of the Emirates Boeing solidifies leadership in the market for widebody aircraft and helps keep at bay the intent of your competitor Airbus SAS to invade his domain with the A350 airliner.
Boeing&#39;s victory in the air show comes four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
Delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Shares of Boeing Co rose 1.5% to $ 67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoacán
Maria Luisa Calderon said that the drug helped his opponent of the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the race for governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderón seems to have lost his bid for governor of Michoacan during the violent state elections, and she said Monday that the drug helped tip the race in favor of one of his opponents.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state Fausto Vallejo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
&quot;The involvement of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only to Michoacan, but for the whole country,&quot; said Maria Luisa Calderon in a radio interview a day after Sunday&#39;s vote.
&quot;They threatened our candidates, our poll workers ... They took over the polls, set up barricades ... and ordered the people to vote&quot; in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until he lost the presidency in 2000.
However, is staging a comeback and victory in Michoacan is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo appears to have narrowly passed Calderon, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative National Action Party, his brother, or PAN, Vallejo refused to recognize the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the position of governor, was third, a major defeat for the left divided and unhappy before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied ties to drug trafficking and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
But violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was murdered a week before the election while campaigning for Maria Luisa Calderon, and many local candidates left nominations fear.
Although the PRI, however distasteful they may seem Michoacan elections, a victory will help boost the game.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, Vallejo congratulated and said, &quot;I think this victory should be very encouraging for next year.&quot;
ADB urges Asia to help rescue the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has appealed to India and China to prepare to help rescue its eurozone sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said the two fastest growing economies in the world had to &quot;do everything possible&quot; to speed economic recovery block and out through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe the difficulties of Europe in a &quot;fair&quot; and said the financial assistance of Asia along with the leadership and resources to help Europe avoid a long-term crisis the global economy.
&quot;We&#39;re all in this together.&quot;
&quot;So anyone who can help Europe emerge from the crisis is useful,&quot; he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
&quot;Asia can be protected to some extent, but can not be immune.&quot;
&quot;So if China and India can help, that is by all means.&quot;
European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy&#39;s borrowing costs have shot up dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that could push the world economy into recession and has led to calls for major emerging economies to join the eurozone to help find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channeled through the IMF, but said the bilateral assistance - such as buying bonds rescue fund of the EU, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided greater bargaining power for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, said that &quot;India will do everything possible&quot; to help the euro as its own economy was now suffering the fall in exports and the depletion of foreign capital inflows.
&quot;Nobody wants the euro zone remains unstable and turbulent,&quot; he said.
&quot;We have monumental challenges and we must maintain a high level of growth.&quot;
&quot;Not an option, it is imperative, because where do we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women.&quot;
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility in helping wealthy Europeans when faced with their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to sell to Europe to help the one billion two hundred thousand people in India, of which up to 800 million living on about $ 2 day or less.
&quot;At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 years and go on vacation to the beaches and that does not go down well,&quot; he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of World Economic Forum, also wondered why India&#39;s reserves were to be used to keep paying the many Greek public sector workers in jobs poorly managed companies and loss- such as railways.
Mr. Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens to &quot;significant ripple effects&quot; throughout Asia.
The forecast of the Asian Development Bank&#39;s 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing the &quot;downside risks&quot; because of the threat in Europe.
He said the vulnerable emerging markets needed to make &quot;contingency plans&quot; to ward off a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious Pentagon warnings about possible cuts in defense
The defense secretary, Leon Panetta, heated Congress on Monday, warning that automatic cuts looming budget could undermine national security and cause a chain reaction from the financial corridors of the Pentagon, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, assembly lines to civilians.
The Pentagon is digesting the 450 billion dollars in cuts over the next decade, but now fears a further reduction of 600 billion or more in cuts may be imminent if Congress fails to reach agreement on the spending.
&quot;The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department,&quot; Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.
He said the failure of Congress to reach agreement on the budget and its sequel, the &quot;kidnapping&quot;, would result in 23 percent of global reductions and an end to many new projects.
&quot;A cut that big, indiscriminately applied in this way would make the most of our naval and construction projects can not run - you can buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts &quot;Panetta wrote to the senators.
&quot;Also we would be forced to set aside many of our civil servants and inadvertently, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it almost certainly would have civil license in order to meet the target.&quot;
&quot;These changes would break faith with those who hold and would seriously damage our military readiness.&quot;
The cuts in time to reach combat troops, Panetta said.
&quot;While funding for wartime accounts overseas contingency operations not directly affected by the kidnapping, the war effort would be adversely affected by the severe disruption of base budgets,&quot; said Panetta.
&quot;The recruitment would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and monitoring contract that supports the war.&quot;
&quot;The staff on the payroll would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to providers in time of war, and the legal and political support would be interrupted.&quot;
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.
&quot;The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline in U.S. main military power in the world.&quot;
&quot;We are firmly against this draconian action,&quot; the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published the letter from Panetta.
&quot;This is not a result with which to live, and certainly not one that we impose on ourselves.&quot;
&quot;Kidnapping is a threat to national security interests of the United States, and should not be allowed to happen.&quot;
If Panetta&#39;s letter and the recent warnings of the senators will increase the pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, although it reached a top job in the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in Congress and the White House and knowing that he faced difficult decisions.
In a press conference last week, Defense Secretary painted a grim picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but no nucleus.
&quot;It&#39;s a ship without a crew.&quot;
&quot;It is a brigade out of bullets.&quot;
&quot;It is an air wing without enough trained pilots.&quot;
&quot;It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to accomplish the mission,&quot; Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
&quot;It&#39;s a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with potential adversaries.&quot;
&quot;In effect, invites aggression ...&quot;
In an appendix to his letter to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how the reductions &quot;generate significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters, severely limits our ability to be deployed and previously committed worldwide, and represents an unacceptable risk to future combat operations. &quot;
And Panetta said some of the largest defense projects could face the ax, including those already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
That list includes the F35 fighter aircraft Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber planned, the next-generation ballistic missile submarine, the new littoral combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
Stop additional development and testing of the F35 could generate 80 billion dollars in savings over 10 years, but supporters say it is the next vital step to improve and deal with potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at recent headlines tells us how serious and pervasive are the deception and lies in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging accusations of sexual harassment with several women, each side accuses the other of lying.
The directors of the Pennsylvania State University have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports said that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, was &quot;caught&quot; with an open microphone saying the U.S. president, Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and troubled countries.
New York Congressman and exhibitionistic Internet, Anthony Weiner, looked ridiculous with her denials quickly refuted by the proof.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with violations of campaign finance related to covering up an extramarital affair.
And again, anyone who lived ever forget the media circus sparked by President Bill Clinton during his second term lie about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Are widespread legends about cheating in school exams and college.
There have been cases where teachers have taken the test answers to students to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors should be teaching to the contrary are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How we are cheating?
On any given day, studies show that you can lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That&#39;s for sure, many of these lies are white lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detect lies, or &quot;the location of lies&quot; is an essential skill that we must have all, for reasons both personal and professional.
Far from being a board game similar to, say, Charade, where the goal is to exclaim: &quot;I have you,&quot; the detection of deception is a branch of knowledge would be based on scientific data obtained during the past six decades in prestigious universities conducted research projects in depth, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that the old myths about the lie has been refuted.
Liars do look at the eyes.
Not always stutter, stammer, blush or disturb.
Can not conclude either that the liars are difficult to detect or expose.
A trained polygraph can learn the truth about the structure of the statement, the expressions microfaciales, the formation of questions and time.
I spent several years probing the scientific findings on deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help you navigate our complex world - especially if their responsibilities professionals include recruitment, interviewing, or managing negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, making them feel at home, managing their own emotions and feeling of how intuitively perceived.
We know from research that extraverts lie more than introverts, men say more &quot;self-oriented lies,&quot; while women report more lies &quot;others oriented&quot; - usually to protect someone&#39;s feelings - that married people lie to their partners less often than people who are not married (but the lies that they say tend to be &quot;huge&quot;).
We also know that if you are perceived as a criminal, others will feel less guilty about lying.
How to tell if someone is lying?
First, observe the subject&#39;s habitual behavior.
This is called &quot;creating a baseline.&quot;
Helps provide benchmarks to measure after the changes.
Note the position of the subject, laughter and vocal feature.
It is better to know if someone taps his foot normally all the time to do when you see unfair accusations foot tapping in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for deceptive behavior groups, verbal and nonverbal.
Consider these groups of behavior as a warning, not as evidence of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the upper body while trying to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, leaning toward an exit, change its position significantly or display a &quot;relief postentrevista&quot; - the exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position after all the hard questions are over.
Interrogators are often falsely see the interview is over only to find that relief postentrevista.
Also pay attention to the vocabulary of the subject.
Scott Peterson screwed to the bottom and used the past tense while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for it nationwide.
People who cheat can also use a spacer language: &quot;I had sex with that woman ... Miss Lewinsky&quot; or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal cues are subtle.
Anyone can use a lot of &quot;restrictive language&quot; when answering a difficult question: &quot;Well ... in truth ... as far as I was ... in my opinion.&quot;
This makes the answer is a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but to develop skills to discover the deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan off the pipeline after the late U.S. threat in its approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - angering unions, while appeasing the environmentalists - the company that seeks to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to re-route it.
TransCanada said Monday night that will move the planned oil pipeline outside the environmentally sensitive area in Nebraska Sandhills, and hopes that the project will gain approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska.
TransCanada&#39;s manager, Alex Pourbax, says the company remains confident that over time the pipeline is approved, albeit with a different route.
This comes after last week&#39;s announcement by the State Department to delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until further explore potential routes to avoid areas of Sandhills of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply groundwater.
&quot;This is a real way forward,&quot; said Rep. Lee Terry, Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may separate any decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although officials denied that politics were involved in the decision.
Obama, in a statement last week, described the decision as the request of the Department of State, and expressed their full support.
The pipeline would stretch 1,700 kilometers from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels per day in the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
This would have to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by the working groups that have opted for the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan they are considering legislation to force a departure from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study of the State Department found that the project posed only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department&#39;s inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to direct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit with fear
A family of New York says the disco diva, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a madwoman in the lobby of his building in Manhattan, terrifying his young daughter to the point that he vomited in fear.
The rant of the singer of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; Monk frightened Genevieve, 18 months of age, both suffered &quot;personality changes, sleep disorders&quot; and &quot;increased their fear of strangers,&quot; says his family in the Supreme Court Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year when the stagehand Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go to a family trip.
While the car picked Kevin Monk, Roseanna Monk down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with their baggage, leading to Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said he stood by the door and put his daughter on the floor for a moment.
&quot;Someone came up behind me and said,&quot; You know what you are doing your daughter? &#39; I said &#39;yes&#39; and I went to pick it up, &quot;he said.
LaBelle warned pregnant women angry.
&quot;He said in an aggressive tone,&quot; I should not have let her daughter near the door, &quot;said Roseanna Monk.
&quot;I said,&quot; I have no interest in what you say or think. &quot;
He was angry and started swearing - the C word and the word aloud J ...
He had a bottle of water and started throwing water bottle on me. &quot;
Genevieve said she became hysterical.
&quot;I told this woman,&quot; Look what you did to my daughter, &quot;said the girl&#39;s mother.
LaBelle pounced on the mother - who still held to Genevieve - and had to be restrained by their environment and retreat to a car that was waiting, Roseanna said Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard he vomited, he said.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but got no response.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return calls for comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family&#39;s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money you get to an association of support for children with cancer.
&quot;The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for their behavior,&quot; said Davis.
&quot;That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when addressing a kindergarten teacher in her arms a child of 18 months.&quot;
Adversity weather slowed the economy
During the first year in office of Mario López Valdez, Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, decreased foreign investment and the economy contracted
The 2011 is a year that will be remembered in economic history of Sinaloa, is the first year in office of Mario López Valdez, calling itself the change that generated great expectations for progress in the economy, but given the climatic adversity Home year, there is no growth, however if you register a deterioration in key indicators of economic development.
Low temperatures in February, as well as causing millions in losses to the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, causing a contraction in overall economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly supported by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, affecting the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the report of effects caused by frost, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damage had 582 000 835 hectares, of which 78.03 percent total damage suffered and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage The main crops were wrecked vegetable, corn and chickpea.
The fall in economic activity has generated, through November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year the growth rate, because while January to March 55 000 053 Sinaloa were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the economically active population for the second quarter, the rate became 28.5 percent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 percent , a rate that would give a number of more than 74 000 Sinaloa unemployed, an increase over the first half of 18 000 969 individuals.
Low liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that public policy been performed.
&quot;What we&#39;re seeing is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market effects of a resource constraint by legislation passed in Congress to combat money laundering , and for people who seizes illegally dollars is not easy for operating, investing and the use of something, &quot;he said.
Migration stopped
Lopez Cervantes said that the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
&quot;The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties to enter, and second because entering already have too many difficulties to find work, that people are staying and is demanding jobs here in the state, causing unemployment to rise, &quot;he said.
Informality
The labor market analysis Sinaloa worse when considering the high level of informality that prevails among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population works in the state without quoting a worker to any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another state labor lags are low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of workers Sinaloa was, until September, 5000 352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7000 375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
In addition to the fall in economic activity and rising unemployment in 2011 has the highest decline in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Economy January-June state FDI totaled 630 000 697 dollars, which represents a fall of 87.74 percent over 5 million 143 thousand 312 U.S. dollars during the same period last year.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government posted a total investment of 17 thousand 280 million pesos in the year, occurring mainly in the tertiary sector companies.
Debt
Against the backdrop of economic downturn, the state government in July asked the state legislature approved a credit of 3 billion pesos, which would be same for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, local congressional approval was for an amount of two thousand 600 million pesos, and November have seen the benefits of debt in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of Mario Lopez Valdes government is demonstrating a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industries, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of wills of the various sectors, including the state government itself.
&quot;The performance of the economy in Sinaloa this year has been really poor, you have to work hard to regain lost ground this year, in 2012 we need to redouble efforts, failed to align the efforts of all and above all good synchronized and start this new government team, we hope that next year is much better, &quot;he said.
Slow economic
Lopez Loredo said that events such as frost earlier this year stopped the state economy and restricted their performance and growth.
&quot;The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frost, one of the main effects has been a slow economy does not turn fast enough to generate economic dynamism, to keep an acceptable level of flow processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below our expectations, &quot;he said.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers Confederation of Mexico in Sinaloa, said the state is required to prosecute the most dynamic productive activities.
&quot;Overall we found that we have been working, we believe it is necessary to develop a long term program which redefines the vocation and the state&#39;s economic direction, it is important to detonate the full potential of the resource material and Sinaloa is human, &quot;he said.
Work to do
Coparmex President stressed the importance of establishing a vision to channel more government efforts.
&quot;Overall I would say that the Government has been striving to be successful in various fields, in terms of economic development there is some progress but it is important to develop a long-term,&quot; he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in their driving public policy.
&quot;There are elements that allow us to say that the government is being more inclusive, I I can say is that there is work done and I think the Government is aware that there is work to do,&quot; he said.
He is sentenced to 8 kgs of marijuana
Five years in prison and a fine of 100 days was a neighbor of Navolato sentenced for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General&#39;s Office reported that the narcomenudista sentenced Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval is on the offense against public health, in its variant of possession of marijuana for purposes of trade.

Should contribute to works
The social works covered by programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants at risk of not being completed or have serious delays due to lack of funds, said Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that, although so far the work programs have advanced themselves at risk by failing to comply with the State Government contributions that correspond to a resource which total more than 11 million pesos in all three programs.
He noted that total investment in these three programs is about 50 million pesos, of which the State accounts for 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so the possible delay in the completion of these is in force.
&quot;They are almost 12 million, which will make plays and although the year is ending have not given us a dime, when in July should give us a hand,&quot; he said, &quot;we delay us not to have begun work and are very advanced, but we need the money. &quot;
He mentioned that last year, the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions which they were entitled, so the administration early in the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million not provided On that occasion the state administration.
&quot;Since we spent in the previous administration because the state did not have the financial capacity to participate and continued walking programs, and this year we have access to these programs had to get the resources to cover what the state left open,&quot; explained .
Although there is a commitment of state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, said he has made the request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to expedite the negotiations so that their corresponding percentages arrive as quickly possible.
&quot;They are almost 12 million, which will make plays and although the year is ending have not given us a dime.&quot;
Court validates &quot;digital switchover&quot; in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals to digital is one of the most important changes that have hit the world in recent years
The Supreme Court&#39;s Office (Supreme Court) dismissed the constitutional controversies brought the Senate and House of Representatives against the presidential decree ahead of the so-called &quot;digital switchover&quot; from 2021 to 2015, by failing to meet the eight votes needed to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, said that President Felipe Calderon did not exceed its authority in issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to realize the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional challenge brought by the Senate, was dismissed for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this is in effect.
The draft statement, prepared by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare unconstitutional the decree, because the regulation of matters of radio and television is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), contrary to the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve law.
A vote for the bill only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero own.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and to support the claims, the minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the decree and all actions it ready for the digital transition.
The full ministers also decided to reject the claim filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering the discussion of the project, also in charge of the minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the minister president said not match the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive can not structure through measures of general rules to prepare public administration.
&quot;Nor do I consider that if I did it affect the autonomy of the regulatory body,&quot; and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the guidance of the State.
The replacement of analog signals to digital is one of the most important changes that have hit the world in recent years, resulting in better utilization of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postpone the change, he said, would delay the benefits of digitization, which involves a decision of public interest, not only a technical dimension, &quot;it covers economic, social, political and national security.&quot;
These issues, he said, &quot;require the operation of the entire system established under the principle of economic stewardship of the state, includes a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the state executive power.&quot;
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world has now completed the digital transition, and has done through the executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
Can not conclude that the government, in issuing the contested decree, invasive in any way the sphere of competence of Congress, as is being provided in the administrative enforcement of laws enacted by the Legislature, said.
Discussed possibility of a count &quot;vote by vote&quot; in Michoacán
According to data produced by the PREP the difference between first and second in the gubernatorial election is only 27 percent, even without the votes counted for 879 of the 6 000 74 minutes total.
The possibility of counting &quot;vote by vote&quot; is a reality in regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacan, where according to the data obtained from the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second governor&#39;s election is only 27 percent, even without the votes counted for 879 of the 6 000 74 minutes total.
In this regard, President of the General Council of Michoacán Electoral Institute (EMI), Maria de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled a few days ago, just last November 9, the electoral body approved a set of guidelines to harmonize local regulations with the federal electoral reform.
As you may recall, Michoacán not homologated its Constitution and Electoral Code of the State or Electoral Justice Act, since Congress approved the reforms of the state shortly before the deadline so they could legally enter into force in this process election and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication in the periods specified in the Law of the State Official Gazette, arguing that he had some objections.
The same 9 November, the Supreme Court&#39;s Office (Supreme Court) decided the constitutional challenge brought by the local legislature and described as &quot;invalid and illegal&quot; vote president of the constitutional state, since no right to &quot;punish them or veto them.&quot;
Interviewed about the possibility of &quot;vote by vote&quot; Mary of the Angels Llanderal stated that with the adoption of appropriate guidelines by the General Council of the EMI will be possible to perform partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial recount of one or more ballot boxes may be on the assumptions that: the results of the records do not match, there is no counting the minutes and counting on the record from the box or not held held by the chairman thereof or, where there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all fields of the election may take place when there indication that the alleged difference between the candidate winning the election in question and who obtained the second in the vote, is equal to or less than one percentage point, as long as the start of the session there is a request of the representative of the party and / or coalition that ran the second of the candidates mentioned.
The total vote count also be made if the end of the regular computation states that the difference between the winner and the candidate allegedly located second is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided there is the request of the representative political party whose candidate came second, in which case the ballot boxes be excluded that have undergone partial recount.
Note that in this situation is the choice of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of 923 total records.

Wednesday will form the new Italian government
The appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with President of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that has put the country on the brink of economic disaster
Italian Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with President of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form a government.
Is expected to present a cabinet composed largely of technocrats, although it is unclear when take over the new executive.
Monti said the president will present the results of his talks with political parties in their attempt to form a government.
&quot;I confirm my complete confidence in the ability of our country through this difficult phase,&quot; said the former European commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not say explicitly that it can form a government but the tone of their comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The &quot;framework is now well delineated,&quot; he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy fought a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti to approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain confidence hit in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry up, volatile markets put the yield on the benchmark 10-year Italian BTP above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employers Confindustria, told reporters after meeting with Monti: &quot;We said we would support much of this government.&quot;
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
The chances of success were boosted Monti considerably by the support of the LDP party of Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced him to resign on Saturday.
&quot;We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are destined to have a good result,&quot; he told reporters Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
Support the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the majority government technocrat who is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
Monti&#39;s new government must have a strong parliamentary support to implement the reforms likely to be unpopular austerity.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could lead to a devastating new attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks were added to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began Monday his consultations with political parties, unions and business groups as well as youth and women organizations.
Round will end its meeting on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Napolitano on Sunday, which has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite late last week when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the Italian debt costs have now become critical levels between uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescue Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the eurozone.
Monti has said his government would last until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions of politicians only give you time to implement reforms before early elections.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist they must be trained technicians only an indication of his objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources said that mutual mistrust and disagreement being the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The touch of Spanish is higher than the Ticos
Of the 22 players called in Spain, ten exceeded the 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica only one of 22 invited reached 50 games.
A glaring contrast to that of Costa Rica, comparing the 22 called on both countries for the friendly today, at 3:05 p. m., in the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world champions and European number one monthly FIFA Rank, posted a long record of Class A interselecciones games, the Tricolor has only defender Michael Umana as the only one with the 50 international matches.
This figure was achieved by the Friday before the game against Panama (0-2), the Rommel Fernandez.
The Spanish players playing in the League All-Star and powerful clubs in the Premier League, remain very active year in league and cup competitions domestic and high-level shocks in European Cups and Champions League.
To this is added the experience of the Spanish Fury in complicated qualifiers for Euro and World Cup.
The players ticos, however, have a limited international experience in an area, as CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum registration of the Spanish national team goalkeeper Iker Casillas is, who last Saturday against England (fall 0-1 in London) equaled the record of exportero Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today at the Tricolor and impose a new record of 127 caps for Spain.
Xavi Hernandez, Barcelona Brain wheel, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized last week by UEFA with the other team&#39;s ancient Iberian, Zubizarreta said 126 and the Schalke striker Raul Gonzalez, 102.
Almost near the centennial figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
Xabi Alonso followed with 91, Fernando Torres, 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both 81, Andres Iniesta, 62, Cesc Fabregas, 61, and David Silva, 53.
Costa Rican side, and about Michael Umana, are left-Junior Diaz, with 48 appearances and striker Bryan Ruiz, 45.
After then, only five exceeded 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez and Jose Luis Lopez 36 to 35.
The least.
With more than 30 concerts in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, are Roy Miller with 26, with 26 Winston Parks, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest does not approach the 20.
While Nacho Moreal only four games and two Jordi Alba, Victor Bolivar in Costa Rica has only one and Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder debut yet.
The leading scorer David Villa of Spain is, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that registers with nine more points, two ahead of Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country on his tour to celebrate two decades of experience
&quot;Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true&quot;
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament, Pearl Jam, said the band is ready to deliver one of his best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
Have been over 20 years of waiting, but the band says that they too will become the dream of playing in the country.
This was stated by bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is on the wing South American tour to celebrate two decades of work and on Sunday, 20 will make its only stop in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p. m., with the band The X angelina and nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt of the conversation, whose full transcript is online at The Nation.
To his followers Costa Rica is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what they are living their fans?
Go to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is only our second time in South and Central America and so far has been great.
I&#39;ve been to Costa Rica only once, on vacation, is a beautiful country and I think we&#39;ll be able to stay a few days there.
So we are excited to bring our music there.
I ask because there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live intensely the previous days.
What do they tell their most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us through all these years.
It took almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thanks for waiting so long and sorry that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even as regards their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Do you add that a bit of pressure on his visit?
Some of the biggest shows we&#39;ve played over the past 21 years occurred during the last couple of weeks.
We played a few shows in Sao Paulo huge and we hope that we have put in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we are very eager to play there.
We love this country, we love to surf and jungle, to both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did Costa Rica discovered its waves and surfing?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves here are amazing.
My friends are always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf, that&#39;s how we learn, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, have been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there before, then we have no restriction on what we can do.
Try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs, try to play a couple songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is this?
I think it&#39;s partly because we have nine discs and can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it&#39;s difficult to choose which songs they play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have not time to play, that keeps us focused and keeps us surprised that reminds us why we liked those songs and that we may have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, are celebrating 20 years of experience.
Looking back, is it hard to believe all they have achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
First, think any of us imagine we&#39;d be in a rock band and have done for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We count our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue making music together.
We all want and we love making music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world who always wanted to go.
Things could not be better for us.
What did it mean for you for having been a fundamental part of the rise of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of great bands.
We are friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It&#39;s amazing when a movement arises from a group of friends and it is unusual.
From time to time, comes a band of a city, but much stranger is when five or ten bands out simultaneously from the same city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Mudhoney were in Canada, saw Soundgarden in his tour, so we are fortunate to be friends with all of them yet and we are honored to be part of the Seattle sound that emerged.
It is also very strange that a band like yours to remain united with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us are together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer lasting many bands.
First, I think we are all lucky to be still alive, and secondly, we all care about others.
We are all very close friends and, through that, too musical avenues have been opened to give freedom to each experiment.
We trust each other with the music of each and could not be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy, but thanks to its success, have been able to do whatever they want.
How to find a balance?
For as we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We ensure that not too on tour because it is easy to fall into the hands of big crowds and people who love your music.
While one remember that people are there for the music, that you remember that you must respect the music and what he brought, without infatuation for being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really cares.
How do you remember his other project Mother Love Bone?
I think I write very good songs and at first it was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and never published a disk until after the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There were many frustrations because last as long and most important is that we are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and more.
It was an amazing man and we miss him.
The national banda The Robertas be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that&#39;s why they chose to open?
Yes, production videos sent us several proposals and that was the band that we liked, so we&#39;re anxious to see what Las Robertas can provide live and should be very entertaining.
Why always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.
He sings and I think it does the first thing that comes to mind.
How bearish, what are your influences?
There are so many.
Within the first that come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski ...
So many I could talk all afternoon about the bears that I love.
How has Pearl Jam grunge maintain relevant despite being no longer a fad?
I think we all always feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think of it, reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came at the same time, and if there are important now, I think it&#39;s wonderful because it is music worth listening to and bands as Mudhoney are making better music now than ever.
At first his music had a darker content and now has become more positive.
Why this change?
It&#39;s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may appear lighter, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe songs that qualify as very dark but can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed I touched them, I cried when I heard songs and are profoundly dark.
I think when you grow up and there was some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or friend, these things start to influence your art and music and these two songs certainly represent that for me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.

He had surgery four times the language of cancer, weight loss has a weight of 18 kilos which will have joined other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure and problems circulation in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori meets detention since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people at the hands of a squad of annihilation of the army that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation headed by the Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will start Tuesday a visit to Mexico in order to expand trade between the two countries and to address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderon, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, trade and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the schedule released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between both presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be &quot;conducive to the exchange of information in all they are political issues between the two nations,&quot; published by the Chair of the South American country on its website.
Local media reports said Calderon Mujica seek to get support to Uruguay in the incident with France emerged when French President Nicolas Sarkozy, the South American country included on a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community to those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that caused the refusal of Uruguay and the call to its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico president since November, the G20, a group composed by emerging and developed world&#39;s most powerful, and is current with the South American country since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the realization of tax sharing arrangements to leave the &quot;gray list&quot; of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), comprised of countries that did not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
On the trade front, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has increased the exchange of goods between two nations.
The mustachioed plumber spends three-dimensional &quot;3D Super Mario Land&quot;
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the evil clutches of Bowser, but never before had done in three dimensions: &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; fight for the love of the Girl stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at stores around the world, has been designed from scratch to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS, you can play in three dimensions without using glasses.
&quot;Mario is the character who has to say how it should function without glasses stereoscopy,&quot; said the head of Nintendo&#39;s press in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is &quot;the first video game that Nintendo originally intended to support&quot;, because until now hits like &quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot; or &quot;Zelda: Ocarine of Time 3D&quot; were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo spokesman has claimed that, despite being in 3D, &quot;3D Super Mario Land&quot; is a video game &quot;accessible&quot; to enjoy a quick game and fluid.
Alvarez said that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; contains two games in one: the first part is &quot;simple&quot; to engage in less skilled users.
Once overcome, the more experts may give a &quot;second round&quot; levels of play, this time the most difficult.
In addition, users can choose between a real-time &quot;aggressive D&quot; or one that only affects the depth of the action, but will need to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and &quot;not to succumb to illusions.&quot;
This incursion of Super Mario in three dimensions is also the return of the character to a handheld, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game Nintendo winks to fans of the series and repeat the successful formula of previous installments, which is that the plumber will have to travel mustache mined dangers platforms in order to free the princess Peach.
Although the player will find new movements, settings, costumes and enemies and also to Luigi &quot;playable&quot;.
Colom supports Portillo&#39;s extradition to the U.S.
President Alvaro Colom said Tuesday that processed the extradition of Alfonso Portillo exgobernante to respond in the United States of conspiring to launder $ 70 million.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request from the north country that claimed to Portillo to stand trial there.
At a press conference, Colom said his decision was motivated by the independence of judiciary and executive, considering that a trial court had already ordered the extradition.
He stated that during his tenure &quot;does not put his hands&quot; in judgments and began processing all extraditions ever known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquin be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Estrada Morales and Victor Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What&#39;s done is a process by Colom executive after being exhausted all judicial and constitutional process to exmandatario between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once it has resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and guarantee their human rights.
Portillo was acquitted by the embezzlement of Q120 million in the Defense Ministry when he was president, which was the process that preceded the extradition, but the prosecution appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was created to avoid falling into the margins of untrained boys
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the institution of social support is important Trinijove: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter century.
This is compounded by the long hundred of jobs currently made for this social group.
The anniversary served to take stock yesterday at a ceremony held in the old factory complex Fabra i Coats attended by over 300 people.
Trinijove born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little education, no job, dogradicción impaired or at risk of falling into marginality.
The celebration yesterday in Sant Andreu concentrated to a large number of responsible entities and institutions in these 25 years have worked with the association.
The diverse political representation, in the long election showed the unitary nature of the work of Trinijove.
Next to the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, Jordi Pujol and his predecessor, attended the ceremony were exconseller Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and exteniente Mayor and current Councilman Ricard Gomà ecosocialist.
Also went to the great hall of the current Fabra i Coats councilor of Welfare i Família, Josep Lluís Cleries, and CEO of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said Trinijove born in a very difficult time and that the current is too, but added that the work done so far &quot;is a good base.&quot;
The president made an example out Trinijove combat the bad circumstances and give hope to people with difficulties.
&quot;The crisis is not new to the entity and the work done,&quot; he said.
Evicted from a farm where they were squatted raves
The invaders had taken over 11 of the 13 floors of the building, Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm at noon yesterday without a fight
It seems that the nightmare neighbors lived 51 of the Balmes street has come to an end.
Twelve people left voluntarily noon yesterday illegally occupying the property, and where they organized raves that despair to the neighborhood, by court order without police intervention.
When the operation ended, changed the lock on the door to prevent a repeat of the situation.
&quot;From now on there will be access control,&quot; said the manager.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13-story building, the rest are inhabited-he took all the wiring and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving a residue of all kinds, especially beverage cans alcoholic.
The first three floors were the scene of mass parties, which lasted two days and desperate tenants.
Next to the building there is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which also has suffered.
The owner, Maria Pantinat told Europa Press that since the building was occupied on business is down 80%.
The owner of the club says that the invaders of the farm made him unfair competition, and who sold drinks to three euros, while in the club worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment venue had to respond to neighborhood complaints of noise, while, as noted, did not cause any inconvenience customers of the club, but the inhabitants of the house squatted and, above all, those attending the parties that are organized there, which had increased in frequency and intensity in recent weeks, as the angry locals.
The head of the club explained that the discomfort was so great that even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that &quot;forgives&quot; the rent.
The city police also confirmed that in recent weeks had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The municipal president of the PP in the Town Hall, Alberto Fernandez Diaz, had claimed last week &quot;to leave the property immediately to solve the problems of coexistence and civic producing neighbors, and the degradation of the area&quot; .
The popular leader explained that before the summer was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the last few months the squatters had entered into all floors and in almost every floor, and that some even have occurred theft.
In this regard he added that &quot;we need to end impunity and be strong against the incivility that has been generated on the farm.&quot;
Also yesterday, the Autonomous evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 1530 hours the police went to 35 street of Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people had access to the building.
The four were arrested at the time.
¿Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the timing of the call beyond controversies over fees
The municipal contest on 16 doors reopened the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In mid 80&#39;s at the height of the now defunct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration churned out leaflets promoting Collserola.
The booklet defined the mountain as the great metropolitan park of Barcelona.
Moreover, was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, moved back to the park, in the minds of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, ​​with the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented in the north-south but up (mountain )-down (sea).
The rating Collserola natural park is in this idea.
The reference was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with the boar on the role of Yogi Bear.
In these he was until, in September, the council convened a megacompetición composed of 16 contests for so many doors to Collserola.
A door leads to the idea of ​​park, no doubt.
Either that or someone tries to stem the tide.
The question comes alone: ​​Collserola, ¿park or mountain?
The competition, both in purely organizational aspect as representing the city of reflection on the topic of conversation among all architects of Barcelona.
It&#39;s almost as a theme to fall back on when two members of this ancient breed of elected are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise precisely to one of the few similarities between what locals are saying three architects, and academics, that have been presented.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel and Martha Mòdol Bayonne: the contest is timely.
For Roland, addressed the coastline after &quot;it is necessary&quot; to discuss &quot;front mountain&quot;, since Cerdà&#39;s speech, that of green apples has not been carried out.
&quot;It is from the basis that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex, &quot;says the architect to whom the title of&quot; doors Collserola &quot;contains a&quot; trap lexical &quot;do not have to think about them&quot; as access to a park, but the delimitation of some areas where action &quot;.
Mòdol, and Bayonne as natural disasters experienced in the urban world, called the proposal &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; with &quot;some dangers.&quot;
Dangers of the &quot;uncertain project that is now public space&quot; after the experience in the 80 and had in the Forum area &quot;his swan song.&quot;
The first fear is the very definition of borders on where to build.
&quot;Limiting something is set and the next step,&quot; ie, its overshoot.
&quot;Think of new urban instruments, planning, because the current [referring to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can lead to real disaster.&quot;
More adhered to the question, Mòdol believes that simplifying the slope vallesana Collserola &quot;can be understood as a park, Barcelona, ​​not&quot; for a purely topographical.
Mòdol remember that there is already work done by the Patronage of Collserola that &quot;should not fall on deaf ears,&quot; but appreciates the opportunity that the city offers its union involved in this project &quot;from the start.&quot;
What&#39;s more, understands that proximity of the mountain with the city is the pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but &quot;doubt&quot; about whether this technical profile which should lead multidisciplinary teams (&quot;a success&quot; , points) that have had to create: &quot;Architects should be only a tool.&quot;
Bayonne suggests that the answer to the question of the title of this piece is complex, because the contest rules lack a global view of Collserola &quot;16 competitions have been called cross-says-on-sea mountain sense, but there longitudinal reading, you see and understand the area as a whole. &quot;
This results, at least in his case, which has elected to participate in 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors may clash in the program and definition of the architect of the next door.
In his opinion, yes, the council should ensure that the range immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide in its entirety, an area of ​​equipment to conduct a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino Larrazabal forgives Jonah and go free
After 72 days of arraignment, the legal representative of the Casino Red granted pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process against him for alleged blackmail
After spending 72 days in jail, Manuel Larrazabal Jonah to go free after the legal representative of the Casino Red grant him a pardon before the Second Criminal Court District, which follows a process of blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the bombing of the Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Garcia Gil, made public a series of photographs and videos of Manuel Jonah allegedly demanded payment of a fee that the city economic Monterrey allow clandestine operation bookmaker.
After public condemnation, the State Attorney General opened a criminal case against the mayor&#39;s brother PAN and was arrested Sept. 2 and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor for Crimes Heritage 3, was taken to the House of Root 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
She remained during the 49 days following the dictársele a second restriction order after the prosecutor dismiss the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19 he was transferred to prison for allegedly blackmailing Cadereyta with a million and half pesos to the owners of Casino Red, but only stayed a few hours in the medium-security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial admitted to the local cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On October 25 he turned an arrest warrant by the clerk of Criminal District Court Second, Jorge Yanez, who said nearly two months of investigations were checked sufficient evidence to establish guilt of John, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the bookmaker in exchange for allowing the operation of it.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, appeared before the judge José Luis Pecina to seek pardon for the regional mayor&#39;s brother, so in the coming hours might regain their freedom.
During the legal diligence, the public prosecutor attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias Garcia Gomez questioned whether he had repaired the damage and who the partners of the bookmaker was the one who granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried to book the name.
Based on the record 197/2011 is granted legal forgiveness Jonah Larrazabal and thereafter may not be made any claims about the process that is followed with him also that no damage will require repair or punishment.
After hearing the legal representative of the bookmaker, close at 15:50 ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton.
The clerk of the court, Jorge Yanez, moved to the jail in the municipality of San Nicolas de los Garza to notify Jonah has been legally pardoned and his record will be filed.
Also notify the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Perez Jacome gives details of the crash which killed Interior Secretary Francisco Blake, and seven others
The Ministry of Communications and Transportation (SCT) reported that the results obtained on the accident which killed Interior Secretary Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others, indicate that the helicopter was hit directly on the ground in complete integrity structural, not the pilot to attempt a landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Perez Jacome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that the aircraft before takeoff, the pilot found that weather conditions were suitable for flight.
&quot;The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the blades came in contact with trees to 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage.&quot;
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport personnel.
He also said that investigations in the area of ​​impact is not reported the appearance of pieces on the ground.
&quot;In a search report no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact is presented in a structural way.
&quot;The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, had adequate requirements to transport passengers.
The land has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
For now, the secretary said it is a priority to have the results soon as possible, however, the investigation may take several months or even one year could reach.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, director general of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said at the time of impact, the Presidential helicopter operating in cruising speed and that this happened in a soft upward.
&quot;This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact,&quot; he said.
In the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Perez Jacome, listed six important element in research:
Visual flight:
Under aviation regulations flight was conducted under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground.
Terms weather:
The reports were located in the right conditions AICM takeoff, the aircraft as it moves towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State presented layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that cloud conditions the crew has searched an area of ​​lower elevation and greater visibility into the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of impact and the last record of the aircraft radar match, probably before the collision there was no loss of control or change in the flight path.
Dispersion of wreckage in a small area:
The information available so far suggest that the impact occurred in a straight line and side.
The dispersion pattern of wreckage suggest that the helicopter struck the ground in terms of structural integrity.
Not detected evidence of fire or explosion:
On the site of the incident remain undisclosed evidence in the wreckage of some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent research results indicate it may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work have found pieces of the aircraft at an elevation of 9 000 200 feet above mean sea level, the ground has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The photographs show the sequence in which foreseeably be dismantled along said path.
The information provided by elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After thorough search in a wider area cordoned off the site, about the accident, have not been found scattered pieces of the aircraft, which strengthens the assumption that the impact is presented in terms of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
Social Security Directs research to find the gene for obesity in children and young people is supported by specialists from the IPN
The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) has announced that conducts research to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people, called protocol &#39;Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence&#39;, which will provide markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry, Specialties Hospital, XXI Century National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz Lopez said that he joined a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, nutritionists and social workers.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (CINVESTAV) National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research is invited to participate in the population is entitled or not, go to the IMSS sport units participating in the Valley of Mexico, where he carried out the tests to children, every Saturday from 8:00 hours.
He stressed that the protocol started in the sports Cuauhtemoc (Mexico State west) and since the October 8, the activity takes place in the Sports Nezahualcóyotl (Mexico State).
Once you meet the goal of bringing 500 to 600 children, the study will continue in the Sports Independence (south of Mexico City) and finally in Morelos Sports Unit (north of Mexico City).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to understand the components and the importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and identify children and young Mexicans risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
To be held this November 14th on World Diabetes Day, said the goal is to bring together three thousand children between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and parental supervision for the implementation of specific questionnaires on diet .
They were also asked about physical activity and family history of disease, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that Saturday is applied to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure measurements, determining the levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (seeks to identify genes that are associated childhood obesity).
Cruz Lopez said that this research reflects the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in children.
&#39;Health Surveys 1999 and 2006 indicated that in just six years there was an increase in the case of children, 77 percent obese, and 47 percent girls, in terms of overweight was also observed a dramatic rise, &quot;said the specialist in the IMSS.
He said the justification for the search of markers is based on the country&#39;s population differs from others by their genetic history.
Reported that the average Mexican is 65 percent of American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and African-five percent and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that generally, the genetics of obesity results in the inability to burn off excess energy consumed (calories) and stored as fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, which can detect if they have some degree of overweight or obese.
Even he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of suffering from metabolic disorders and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors delivered in writing to parents, who have explained each of the measurements and changes in lifestyle to be done to prevent disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three major components that lead to overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting watching TV and use means of transport instead of walking distances short.
Also due to the high caloric intake, ie, increased consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrate (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein and genetic analyzes in this protocol.
Asphalt UNAM avoid potholes
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry, UNAM, develops polymer-modified asphalt to produce a mixture with better performance regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
If the signals sent by the pavement were addressed, it would be necessary to repair about 200 thousand potholes each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of ​​Mexico, Najera said Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (CF) of the UNAM, who said that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is adequate, the bumps could be reduced in quantity or even eliminated.
In his lecture A technological review of the bumps, issued under the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory in charge of developing polymer-modified asphalt to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to asphalt, but with a greater mechanical strength, both at high and at low temperatures.
Nájera Herrera felt that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country to improve its performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt, the heavier oil is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, a high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and other low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the floor its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves as a liquid at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high as 50 degrees Celsius has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt streets is not uniform, but is modified during the day according to temperature and environmental conditions, said the specialist in chemical engineering.
The researcher observed that CF the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve the asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt, composed of small stones dipped in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones which is the folder, he said, is bathed with asphalt.
When driving vehicles and generated efforts, it allows the forces are spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt would spread even better, said chemical engineer.
On the asphalt, he added, place a final layer folder called rolling, which is made of a fine stone material, ie sand also bathes in asphalt.
Since this is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of vehicles, must have more mechanical strength than asphalt and provide friction on the road.
As part of the pavement that is to receive and disseminate efforts, rolling folder also requires having the right thickness and must care for the material it is made.
The weather, especially humidity and temperature variations are also an important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it affects considerably the performance of the asphalt.
When the soil is wetted, water diffuses into the interior of the folder and is difficult to leave, this causes a softening of all layers of the pavement and therefore, the formation of bumps.
In the process of forming a bump, he said, the first to wear the film is rolling and is affected only after the asphalt, but the damage does not happen instantly, but a process that should be addressed at the first signs with appropriate maintenance programs.
Also a member of the National System of Researchers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each layer of the pavement should be provided in relation to vehicle load and ensure meets, to avoid the formation of bumps frequently.
Rafael Herrera said that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and even help repair potholes with ease and without using high temperatures.
What the candidate lacked the Valley to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of contributing factors to Serna Melina Ramirez did not reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley gets its title number 14 princess.
Again the Valle del Cauca is left with the desire of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Serna Melina Ramirez had to make do with being on the winning podium, wearing the crown of silver and the band is credited as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and scepter, the department and adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina is one of the legion of women who have been close vallecaucanas crown but were proclamations Ospina princesses including Miriam Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Dominguez (1949), Bellini Patricia Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Aljure Garces (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many ask is: What was missing?
Because the result is the defeat of a great favorite in each performance showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie Vogue, titles that were queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision to designate it took the jury of First Princess is that not convinced with his answer to the question &quot;What is that book that has marked you and why? Made by Martin Gomez Murillo , the Literary Read Carreta.
At the Valle del Cauca interrrogante said
&quot;I read a lot, I think a lot in the literature, I think it is a form of culturalizarse definitely think the book that I scored from childhood is&quot; The Little Prince &quot;is a pretty deep book.
Today I read &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; is a book of literature we should all read, and now I&#39;m reading the book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called &quot;The heat of blood&quot;. &quot;
A bit like the first response by &quot;culturalizarse&quot; and second for not explain in particular how each of the books cited have been marked.
But Melina After the ceremony said he was calm and happy with the result &quot;the universe is wise to spend what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little, &quot;The Prince&quot; is a great book &quot;
Among the hypotheses launched Valle said that the burned favoritism.
A reporter suggested that Bogota being the favorite, the acclaimed and the candidate took all preliminary awards (Oster food challenge, the public vote for the best traditional costume, and Queen Mother), &quot;that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, the Queen stressed out and so did not shine on stage. &quot;
And it showed in his first appearance in a swimsuit on the beach of Hilton and two evening shows at the coronation.
Although both looked safe, it was noted that he lacked the strength and momentum that Magdalena and Atlantic representatives did show.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the program &quot;Home&quot;, the RCN said that the fact that Melina was appointed princess &quot;finds that the candidate who wins more awards during the competition is not a queen.&quot;
In addition, Valle was very elusive to the latter with the press, and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valley failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of National Beauty Contest.
For one thing, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of his country.
&quot;Beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, one must look beyond the physical and focus on social awareness, that before entering the contest are already involved in projects,&quot; he said.
Valley is also speculated that he sinned by their defects in the derriere and fibrosis that it showed in his abdomen, but is contradictory precisely because the jury chose her as the candidate &#39;natural beauty&#39; with the body more healthy, good nutrition and physical work responsible.
The preparer of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, which had better, &quot;but the problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, but the truth for me was not very noticeable, I got points on the last day.&quot;
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, issue stickers considers the error of the Valle del Cauca were who underwent surgery.
&quot;The surgeries are fine, but the Valley is not known to do.
His body was never strong and here it is charged. &quot;
For this award, which delivers first National Beauty Contest, after the parade in bathing suits came a cruel prophecy was fulfilled last night, it was said that this was the contentillo that Raymundo Melina gave him not to give the like the crown.
Reality or not, the fact is that Melina today begins a year of reign, not sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives you the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions for appointment of National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens that despite its overwhelming passage through Cartagena, was elusive crown.
This was the work of Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A Cali lofoscopista made history as the man who confirmed the death of &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;.
The work of these officials is key.
On 4 November a CTI Cali lofoscopista made history as the man who confirmed the identity of the FARC&#39;s top leader &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;, through the comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopistas working in the branch of CTI, this week it was the turn of &quot;availability&quot; to Eleazar Gonzalez, a man in Puerto Tejada who has 21 years working in the area of ​​judicial investigation.
When you start your career, Gonzalez worked in municipalities of Chocó, where they often had to go for more than five days in the jungle to reach the site where the bodies were to be be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after making the corresponding courses, specialized in lofoscopia, which is the study of skin friction, ie the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano Eliazar warned to carry clothes for three days minimum.
Something big was coming.
On Friday night he went to the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
I knew I had to identify two corpses and suspected that one of them was the man who led the world&#39;s oldest guerrilla, so they asked him to take the card tenprint of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team to the site where the body was not recognized by their physical appearance, it was very different from that seen in the media.
He was clean-shaven, dressed as a farmer in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints do not lie.
Accompanied by a magnifying glass Galtonian, ink, a transplantador and a flashlight, Eleazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with the card.
His eye did not fail him: he was &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;.
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was asked to confirm the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, yes it was the top leader of the FARC.
In search of the fingerprint
For a fingerprint of the Cali Sijin recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos Gonzalez Eliazar in the press conference for the operation against &quot;Cano&quot; is very significant.
Many people not familiar with our work.
The fingerprinting is an exact science, no margin of error, which can be key in solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of bodies, the lofoscopistas support research for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of those captured.
When captured, many criminals have false identification papers or no papers.
We will take the fingerprint and seek in the database.
The researcher said that, in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of wall of a house, for in that place the thief had supported his hand to take a safe full of jewels and money.
&quot;The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to get a print, but then we get the footprint of the entire hand and identify the offender, who had participated in several robberies,&quot; he recalled.
Traces may also dismiss or affirm suspects in homicide cases.
I recently found a man dead, with liquor bottles around.
Through the investigation it was determined that a family could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a mark on the bottle match.
Although this does not guarantee that it was the murderer, other places it in the scene.
A fingerprint expert explained that CTI objects &quot;traces are removed with chemical reagents or physical.&quot;
When they appear, is used to lift transplantador or tape.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, who is the criminal database, or the Registrar.
&quot;The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,&quot; said CTI expert.
He clarified that not everything is as shown in the television show CSI.
And not everything that glitters is gold, not everything you touch turns footprint.
However, if may be used, if the comparison is performed in question.
The &quot;outraged&quot; challenge to authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters flocked to the square Zuccotti camping.
Much attended the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
The members of the movement occupies Wall Street on Tuesday challenged the authorities of New York to try to enter again, under the protection of a court order, to the square of Manhattan where they were evicted at dawn and trying to occupy another park the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters flocked to the square Zuccotti, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order allowing &quot;outraged&quot; back to camp on site, while another part of the movement responded to evict occupying a park north of the city where there has been further arrests.
&quot;Our idea is that if the court allows us to return to camp in the square, we will install somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, and through peaceful demonstrations and sit-ins,&quot; said one of the spokesmen of the movement &quot;occupies Wall Street&quot;, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the &quot;outraged&quot; the eviction of his camp issued personally by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the demonstrators to remain encamped.
In addition, the &quot;outraged&quot; proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the downtown Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish Trinity Church.
At least for an hour managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the precise figure, while Efe said he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization ensures that several hundred people that had moved into that spot and has already shifted a delegation of religious leaders in show of support for members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the square Zuccotti, which is an area of ​​private property, remains closed pending the conclusion of a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday in which to analyze the legality of the evacuation this morning.
Some of the protesters were carrying and displaced up there at this time distributed copies of the court order and even gave the officers guarding the place, causing &quot;some minor clashes,&quot; said Bray, who claimed that some officers delivered blows to the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities evict the Wall Street occupies members and enforce &quot;laws that were released after the start of the occupation or prohibit access to the demonstrators back to the park with shops and other property used before.&quot;
Mayor Bloomberg said to reporters that, because of that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the public space and protesters, who warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install with shops campaign and sleeping bags.
Councilman personally defended the eviction carried out at dawn of the square Zuccotti, an operation that proceeded to about 200 arrests and it was decided because the protesters were &quot;violating the law.&quot;
Bloomberg said he gave the order to evacuate the place because it was becoming &quot;a place where people did not come to protest, but to break the law and, in some cases, harm to others&quot; as &quot;Some businesses had received threats&#39; and neighbors feared&quot; for quality of life. &quot;
&quot;The removal of this morning was disgusting and shows that deep Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests of American workers,&quot; added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of &quot;lack of respect for freedom of expression. &quot;
The makers of &quot;Wall Street occupies&quot; also indicated that intend to organize &quot;great deeds&quot; for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months during the protests, which began on September 17.

Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, appear on the television program &quot;It&#39;s a Russell Peters Christmas&quot; on December 1
The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been the assistant Tim Allen on &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, lifeguard on &quot;Baywatch&quot; Bunny &quot;Playboy&quot;, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model is the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special for Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the &quot;crooner&quot; (ballad) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, appear on the television program &quot;It&#39;s a Russell Peters Christmas&quot; on December 1, giving life to a very Mary particular.
CTV today distributed pictures of the television show in which Anderson, also known for its wide distribution in a home video internet pornographic appears with her then husband, the drummer for &quot;Mötley Crüe&quot;, Tommy Lee, is dressed as the Virgin Mary in a manger holding a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as host part of the tour &quot;My Violent Torpedo of Truth&quot; Charlie Sheen appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special features the Canadian singer Bublé, who married late March in Buenos Aires with the model Luisana Lopilato Argentina, and is no stranger to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called &quot;bitch&quot; Kim Kardashian to the U.S. during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan emerges after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and ending the spiral of falls that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake, resulting in a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe suffered by the country Nippon since the Second World War.
Early government estimates the material losses amounted Tokyo at 300,000 million, a blow that despite the difficult global context, seems to have dimmed.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the data of GDP between July and September helped to turn the page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and a 6% annualized rate.
Recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese fiscal year starts in March 2012 - is also the fastest pace of growth since the period January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained in part by the surge in the purchase of machinery to restore areas ravaged by the earthquake and ensuing tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% versus 0.9% decrease in capital expenditures was observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted gains.
However, the true revulsion of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse invited to take advantage of crisis to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure, use the gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has aroused mainly by domestic consumption trends, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed 1%, driven by increased spending on cars, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of yen
Tokyo has been instructed to market, when the yen - the JPY - has become one of the &quot;refuge values&quot; chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro area and the troubled U.S. forecasts ., a privilege that weighs heavily on the accounts of export companies.
With a stronger currency, the products more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic waterline is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed its weak results between July and September to the yen.
As markets continue their siege of the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower our guard.
&quot;We must be alert to the risks that remain, such as deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of yen,&quot; he said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that most member countries in September showed signs of economic slowdown sharper.
The indicator anticipates the turning points in the global economy showed that the major powers are slowing.
Since dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro zone even fell below the mean, which is at level 100, eight tenths rushing up to 99.13 points.
Athens returns to feed the doubts
Papadimos says it will adopt the settings, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With risk premiums and uncertainty triggered peripheral reinstalled on the floors, Greece is still entangled in the maze that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new transitional government is more Hellenic requirements imposed by Brussels for a genuine conviction of political forces began to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days agreed in their description may fall short for application, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, claimed that not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections, due on February 19.
&quot;The main task of this Government is implementing the decisions of the summit of 26 October,&quot; he said yesterday Papadimos when opening a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new government.
A package with 24 programs to boost employment, reform of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message does not clear Samaras doubts about his position: &quot;We are committed to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else.&quot;
The Conservative leader was one step further in his pulse on the EU and the IMF, the agencies must release the 8,000 million Athens urgently needed, and made clear he will not give its approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, escocida yet the impact caused by the cracking of the referendum Papandreou reiterated yesterday that its demand is strong: aid not unlock if the new government and the leaders of the major parties do not sign Hellenes &quot;a written undertaking not ambiguity and as soon as possible. &quot;
Economic Affairs spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, said the troika inspectors return &quot;very soon&quot; to Athens to discuss with the new government &quot;that is needed to pay for the sixth tranche&quot; of 8,000 million, although there is no definite date.
The Greek skein thread still has time.
Sofia: &quot;They are instruments of progress and hope&quot;
Queen highlights the place &quot;dominant&quot; in Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain &quot;has reached a prominent place worldwide in the role of Microfinance&quot;.
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become in the last two decades in the second donor arises in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose &quot;essence&quot; said lies in being an &quot;instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in humans. &quot;
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the Global Microcredit Summit V in Valladolid with the conviction that &quot;no doubt&quot; that such operations are &quot;absolutely essential&quot; to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by United Nations 2015, and &quot; especially in one that has the goal of halving the volume of people living on less than a dollar a day, with in fixing the &quot;poverty line&quot;.
Spain &quot;still working&quot; to expand the network of beneficiaries &quot;all over the world, and assumes the task with&quot; responsibility, &quot;said Sofia, who hoped that the efforts and contributions originating from the Summit, which runs until on Thursday, &quot;ensure the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women&quot;, the main beneficiaries of these loans.
They are &quot;many achievements&quot; and &quot;many challenges that we face.&quot;
The Microcredit Summit arises not only as a forum for debate, but also as a platform to promote &quot;two basic goals.&quot;
Thus, His Majesty explained that he hopes that the end of 2015 are 175 millions of poor families who have agreed to these financial services and a hundred million of these households out of poverty in which they are immersed.
The momentum in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world &quot;has followed the path that started years ago as a pioneer&quot; by Muhammad Yunus, shoulder Sofia as an &quot;act of justice and due recognition.&quot;
And he described the father of this tool as an &quot;idealist admirable in the universal cause of the fight against poverty&quot;, whose work has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn on the ground its lending policy.
This experience was followed a year later the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and &quot;all I have seen the continued evolution,&quot; said His Majesty, whose link with this project yesterday earned him the epithet of &quot;householder&quot; meeting in Valladolid by the &quot;baquero of the poor.&quot;
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and finding solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
&quot;Ethical imperative&quot;
The foreign minister, Trinidad Jimenez, said that solidarity &quot;is an ethical imperative&quot; to every democratic state.
In this sense, he said that would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic boom, as it is a &quot;continuing obligation&quot;.
Jimenez found that microcredit represent &quot;a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty,&quot; and now &quot;more than ever&quot; governments of developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and not let it fall victim to the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is &quot;one of the main lines of development cooperation.&quot;
For his part, Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, praised the &quot;success&quot; to &quot;trust&quot; people &quot;who excluded all the doors closed,&quot; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva , welcomed those present to a city that &quot;opens infected the spirit of solidarity.&quot;
The CDU proposes electing the president by universal suffrage European
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday November 14 in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulty Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democrat party.
Initially was not included in the agenda of the future of Europe, but the issue was imposed in autumn, in particular to meet the activists who believe that government policy is currently too lax with the Greeks and could be in a future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only had nine votes against and ten abstentions.
The standing ovation of several minutes they earned with their interventions, and Angela Merkel, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Minister of Finance Europhile, clear any possible doubt.
The key idea of ​​the Chancellor, and motion, are summarized in a slogan: the response to the crisis &quot;is not less Europe, but Europe.&quot;
Because Europe is not only peace but also because &quot;nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.&quot;
For the Chancellor, &quot;it&#39;s time to break ground in Europe.&quot;
This could manifest itself in the Lisbon Treaty changes to allow strengthening oversight of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the countries of the euro area, but could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to &quot;give a face to Europe. &quot;
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly thought of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Indeed, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven reach rapid agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU Nicolas Sarkozy seem to know that too.
But the ball is on the ground.
In addition, delegates have overwhelmingly rejected the proposed weighting of each country of the European Central Bank policy based on the weight of each economy, which obviously would strengthen the weight of Germany.
Eager to calm the situation within his party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But neither is it who has tried to win over its congress at the expense of &quot;small&quot; European countries or countries in difficulties willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although Europe motion on a section on the importance of &quot;Franco-German friendship,&quot; Angela Merkel has mented to France.
Except in passing.
Recalling that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle at Leipzig.
In fact it was one of the most humiliating defeats to Napoleon&#39;s army.
The incidence of fraud in sick
After subsidies, the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against sickness.
Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a cash charge of family allowances and a speech on the subject, appellant since 2007, the fight against social fraud and assistantship.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, that part of the will to save a rigorous, yet reminiscent of a shaft straight presidential campaign, most want to focus on sick leave.
First, to implement budget cuts: the government plans to impose on private sector workers a fourth day of absence before you can take the floor.
In short, unless a specific enterprise agreement, a worker who falls ill lose four days&#39; pay, ie at least 15% of their monthly income.
This is a move that could raise a wave of anger, but would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, other measures would be accompanied with a more symbolic officials impose a day of absence without pay if sick leave (so far, have no lack, before the three days that are applied in the private sector) .
While these issues are discussed, most put back on the table also the issue of fraud, this time facing the abuse of sick leave.
&quot;They will significantly increase controls and also, if someone is caught committing fraud, shall repay the amounts,&quot; said Xavier Bertrand speaking on RTL on Sunday November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of ad look slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud relating to sick leave.
In fact, since 2002, keeps constant track of this issue and have launched several offensives policies typically have borne fruit.
The French did not sicker than the rest of Europe.
Look closely, first, the national figures.
According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM) in 2006 were paid over 237 million in sick leave benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in health economics, subsidies accounted for the low in 2008, 5% of health expenditure, amounting to 11,300 million euros.
Of this amount, 46% corresponds to the maternity and employment injury, while 54% is related to sick leave, rising to 6,200 million euros.
Thus, 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French have taken an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of Alma Consulting Group.
A sock that undoubtedly hides deviations: Another survey, published in 2007 by professional management Syrian Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said that they had not taken a single day of sick leave .
Another study, in this case the Assurance Maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of sickness absence lasted less than 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a months, 15% of one to three months and 11% were longer.
In comparison with our European neighbors, French workers are no more likely than elsewhere to take sick leave.
A large study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the rate of overall absence from work (both for health reasons or otherwise) ranged in France, between 10% and 11% , compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sickness absence is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a rather limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has caused checks sickness absence of more than 45 days are systematic.
In 2008, 1.5 million visits, the CNAM found in 13% of the 285,000 made, that low short-term were &quot;unjustified or too long&quot;, ie 37,050 cases.
In the case of lower than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11% of the cases were &quot;properly adapted or unjustified, a figure that, with the game a total of 1.2 million, amounting to 132,000.
Therefore, reaching a total of 169,000 cases &quot;unjustified&quot; among millions of workers who took sick leave.
Undoubtedly, an insignificant in comparison, for instance, with work in black.
According to the UMP deputy Dominique Tian, ​​author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenue between 9000 and 15,000 million euros a year, ie more than the total cost of the benefits low and certainly considerably more than the fraud in the latter area.
Papademos: Greece will implement a new plan of adjustment
Greece will need a new plan to right the economy setting.
This is what I said on Monday 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament, further added that the hundred days that have been granted to the union government would not achieve that goal.
&quot;To make efforts leading to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new program of fiscal adjustment,&quot; the Prime Minister, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of debate on the vote confidence in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of decisions taken at the Summit of the euro area on October 27 will be the &quot;principal task&quot; of the new government, because &quot;at stake&quot; the country&#39;s standing in the euro area, he added.
Consequently, Papademos is envisaged that the country&#39;s public deficit will be reduced &quot;to about 9%&quot; of GDP by year end, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of rights group, on Monday showed support for the measures already adopted to try to get out of debt crisis, but warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
&quot;We will not vote for new measures,&quot; he said during a meeting with members of his party &quot;New Democracy&quot;.
He noted that he agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, as well as to combat waste, but against any policy that impedes economic recovery.
A Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU desbloquearían the loan of 8,000 million euros needed without a written guarantee of support from all parties to the proposed measures, Antonio Samaras has responded that his word would be sufficient and would not sign anything because of external pressure.
An expert committee says they should legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide
Canadians living in denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In the field of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and physicians work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to your doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make provisions to that effect.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from various fields, including ethical, legal and medical.
This committee recommends the Government to amend the Criminal Code so as to permit assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient raises the option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries worldwide.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that &quot;the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture where people are afraid to address the issue of death.&quot;
With medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And even though most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them just died in hospital.
Overall, the highest rate recorded in this sense, Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospital.
Regarding the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report&#39;s authors came to conclusions that do not match the federal government&#39;s position, which has already declared that they want to change the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or not a criminal offense, there is no proof that that not considered a criminal offense has not caused a abuse of its application, ie, the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with people not competent or had not consented.
Jocelyn Downie, author of the report, said yesterday via teleconference, on the contrary, most excesses were observed in those countries that do not have legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide.
&quot;In Canada, euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal.&quot;
&quot;In Canada, assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal,&quot; said Jocelyn Downie.
The Canadian pro-euthanasia
Remember that 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favor of euthanasia, as saying that would allow people whose death is close alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010.
Additionally, 66% believe that the failure to legalize euthanasia will not understand that the life of the elderly and disabled have less value.
As for people who have practiced assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that there should be a process against them.
In relation to the maintenance or disruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not as clear as the authors of the report.
In addition, its recommendations suggest that indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of healthcare, if legally rejected, not a criminal offense.
The expert committee also calls for the formation of health professionals on duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses care at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
In the field of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and physicians work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is widely used in health institutions in Canada, the Committee requests that, except that serves to reduce physical pain, is considered as euthanasia and undergo the same procedures.
Other experts have reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as &quot;extreme&quot; views of the experts who signed the report, among other things because it limits the practice of euthanasia for the terminally ill.
&quot;This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of life and has more than 18 years may request assisted suicide,&quot; said Deschamps, who presented a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also notes that the report&#39;s authors seem to give priority to personal autonomy over all other values ​​of society.
But he adds that &quot;in society, there are labels and limitations.&quot;
The specialist health law Margaret Somerville also expressed &quot;strong opposition&quot; regarding the conclusions of the report, calling it &quot;manifesto in favor of euthanasia.&quot;
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, puts into question the lack of abuse especially in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
Jordan&#39;s king urged President Assad from power
Damascus denounced a &quot;conspiracy&quot;
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar Assad said yesterday before the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday intensified diplomatic pressure on Syria&#39;s Bashar Assad, with Russian support, the resists and complains that there is a &quot;plot&quot; against the country.
Two days after withdrawal of Syria from the Arab League, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighboring Syria, have called for the abandonment of power by President Asad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the first Arab leader who asked President Bashar Assad to &quot;give power&quot; in Syria, where they have died some forty civilians and members of the regime&#39;s forces.
&quot;If Bashar really cares about his country, should resign, and create the conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life,&quot; the king of Jordan, Syria&#39;s neighbor, in an interview for the BBC.
Meanwhile, the Turkish foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that the mediation efforts has been making since the beginning of the year Turkey to the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
&quot;Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their people and can not satisfy them, will leave,&quot; he said referring to Syria, a neighboring country for which Turkey is adopting an increasingly tough stance.
Meanwhile, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States have held that it has &quot;strengthened the consensus against Asad and the actions of the regime&quot; Syrian.
&quot;The international community, the United States, EU, Arab League and other countries such as Turkey, are taking an increasingly tough tone&quot; with respect to repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, State Department spokesman.
Meanwhile, have already killed 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime&#39;s forces in the region of Deraa, in southern Syria, as announced by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died &quot;during bombing and shooting with heavy machine guns in Khobar&quot; in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem, for its part, that the country &quot;moving towards the end of the crisis.&quot;
It has also reacted strongly to the Arab League&#39;s decision to suspend his functions damask, which in his opinion constitutes &quot;a dangerous step.&quot;
Syria &quot;will not waver,&quot; he added, ensuring that &quot;the plots hatched against Syria will fail.&quot;
Following the decision to suspend Syrian Arab League currently studying a &quot;mechanism to protect civilians&quot; and to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, has also expressed support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime&#39;s repression, in his opinion, is contained in the &quot;paranoia&quot;.
It is planned to hold an extraordinary meeting of the new League Rabat tomorrow to tune the implementation of the plan out of the crisis adopted on November 2 which provides, in particular the withdrawal of the armed forces of the cities that are in the hands of the opposition and the release of detained protesters.
The Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, has deemed today as &quot;wrong&quot; decision of the Arab League, while China called on Syria to implement the plan of ending the crisis, although not expressed his support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time to market and sacrifices to the Italian
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has requested some time for markets to team up and launch a program that will include &quot;sacrifices&quot; for recovering lost credibility over the last months of the Berlusconi government.
Former European Commissioner discussed with political parties yesterday and today met with unions and employers.
Should form a relatively small cabinet, made up of technocrats from outside the Parliament.
&quot;Monti spoke of a large program with many sacrifices,&quot; said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small groups of MPs who participated in the meetings, after meeting with President of the Council appointed.
Meanwhile, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expects Mario Monti requested by Friday a vote of confidence in Parliament to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation concluded with the presentation by Mr. Monti, a limited list, no doubt a dozen Ministers, the Head of State Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented nervousness in stock markets and bond yesterday, requesting time.
The &quot;democracy, there are time-bound&quot; to form a government and prepare your program, he said, adding that he is &quot;confident that markets will have patience and understand.&quot;
The appointment by the President initially obtained the approval of the markets, but then imposed a concern, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister designate should create a team composed mainly of technocrats, has stressed that even if you would like to include &quot;political&quot;.
The new government will run until 2013, before the next legislative consideration.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday.
Monti is committed to that when he takes office, will work given the urgency and in order that Italy &quot;regain its prominence&quot; in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that &quot;even with a new government will not change our assessment of the Italian economy.&quot;
The EU is convinced that Rome does not reach its goal of achieving a balanced budget in 2013 despite the austerity measures adopted in recent months, has called for new measures of rigor.
The &quot;boss of bosses&quot; Emma Marcegaglia Italian, you see the kill, he also insisted on the need to boost the economy, &quot;since a country that is not growing can not meet the requirements for the deficit.&quot;
Monti, known for their competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), is an &quot;epochal change&quot; for Italy after 17 years of &quot;Berlusconi&quot;, the &quot;teacher&quot; stands for &quot;the challenge of seriousness&quot; and &quot;other Italy &quot;, say the editorialists.
The big question is the longevity of your computer.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to place before April 2012 some 200,000 million in government bonds.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, said Monday as an American NGO specializing in the nuclear risk.
For identification of the researcher, the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by the agency of the UN.
The IAEA last week expressed &quot;grave concern&quot; over a &quot;possible military dimension&quot; of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to ISIS, drawing extensively on documents of the IAEA, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and had participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of &quot;nanodiamonds&quot; in Kiev.
Economic problems of your company would have been contacted, in 1995 with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Then, it is believed that Iran cooperated with the program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA says that there are &quot;clear indications that Iran is developing&quot; a nuclear detonation &quot;with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique, but also, as reported by a State member to the Agency, he worked for most of his career in the technology in the military nuclear program in their country of origin. &quot;
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% between 2009 and 2010, while in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have declined or increased only slightly, as indicated by the statistics published by the FBI Monday.
According to these figures, the number of acts of violence against Muslims has risen from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, ie increased by 49% compared with a rise of 13% in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14% in the number of crimes and anti-religious.
The total number of &quot;hate crimes&quot; has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% is due to racial differences and 20% of religious differences, according to the FBI.
&quot;After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that grew further such crimes and misdemeanors,&quot; said the advocacy organization Human Rights Human Rights First, &quot;the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant,&quot; the organization said in a statement.
&quot;Human Rights First has long argued that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes should be considered a serious violation of human rights,&quot; says an official of the organization, Paul Legendre.
&quot;The U.S. government can and should strive to end such abuses,&quot; he adds, considering that such efforts could include increased police reports on &quot;hate crimes&quot;.
The &quot;hate crime&quot; in U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, color, religion, origin, and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday changed the presentation of its platform to enable its users, including surveillance for the people that follow, which causes your service seems a little to Facebook.
A new tab &quot;activity&quot; and another called &quot;name&quot; let go more legibly and direct the activity of other &quot;Twittos&quot; ie, those Internet users whose messages (&quot;tweets&quot;) is on the Internet or who follow you.
This lets you know if you follow up on messages, if paid on new accounts, if they qualify as favorite a message, etc..
This new formula was tested Twitter &quot;with a small percentage of users in August,&quot; before running the rest of the network on Monday, as indicated by AFP Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known by some instinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another person, followfriday suivre pour un autre recommander of utilisateur) le bonheur des initiés faisant, ainsi s&#39;ouvre a large public avec plus a comparable maniement celui des plus grand public réseaux Google + Facebook et.
In the network, users have debated hit &quot;tweets&quot; with different views the interest of this innovation.
&quot;It is useless, it is invasive and too much like Facebook,&quot; writes @ jemb123.
&quot;The function activity will help me to better follow some elements of my Twitter stream,&quot; writes @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a &quot;golden rule&quot; budget in the Constitution
The grand coalition government of Social Democrat / Democrat is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a &quot;golden rule&quot; to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of the sovereign rating of Austria part of credit rating agencies (AAA).
Social Democratic Chancellor was himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a cabinet meeting, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly less than the debts of countries like Italy, Greece or Spain.
&quot;If it would reduce the solvency of Austria on one level, from AAA to AA +, would have to pay 3,000 million euros more in interest every year,&quot; said Democrat Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is responding to a request from the Brussels Summit member countries of the euro area last October 26: here, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, by the end of 2012, reducing deficit and restore balance of public accounts in the Constitution or a law of equal value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is approaching the &quot;German model&quot; since Germany was the first European country that adopted such a &quot;rule&quot;.
Before 2017, the structural deficit should decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the structural deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% annually on the GDP, while the regional states and the municipalities, should present balanced budgets.
The goal is that by 2020/2021, public debt is reduced under the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threat with a new exchange market intervention
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned Tuesday that authorities would intervene again Nippon marking the change if the yen continued to rise.
&quot;Intervene, as we did last time, if we find that there is excessive volatility&quot; in the exchange rate of the yen, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to reach levels close to the highs that caused the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the yen, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to U.S. currency.
But the yen has been going up steadily ever since, driven by investors buying it as a &quot;refuge value&quot; in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar quoted again on Tuesday to below 77 yen and the euro has dropped below the symbolic bar 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that caused the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the yen hurts exports of the archipelago, as more expensive products Made in Japan and reduces the value of income earned abroad by Japanese companies when converted into local currency.
&quot;Japan is struggling to rebuild&quot; after the earthquake and tsunami of March 11 that devastated the region of Tohoku (northeast), Noda said that fears that the rising yen root cutting the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has regained growth in the third quarter (by 1.5% over the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to increased exports and consumption of households affected by catastrophe.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect the &quot;economic fundamentals of Japan.&quot;
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, the BOJ said it had taken &quot;appropriate measures&quot;, implying that one should not expect further monetary easing on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the increased bank of five billion yen (47,000 million) purchases of Treasury bills, leading to the 55 trillion yen (519,000 million) the threshold of the funds that engages in the acquisition of various financial instruments to flood the market with liquidity.
Euro area:
rates grow, the stock falter
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis is hurting European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the types of the weakest countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the stability of the euro area, European shares sink a little deeper into the negative zone on Tuesday November 15.
In Paris, at 10 am, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% and stands at 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt lost 0.4% and 0.1% in London.
&quot;Given the new tensions in relation to yields on loans from the States of the euro area most affected, stock markets around the world are paying some of their recent gains.&quot;
&quot;Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of infection,&quot; explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
Tokyo stocks closed with a drop of 0.7%, renewing concerns of the auditors of the market in relation to Europe&#39;s ability to contain the debt crisis.
&quot;Japan, as elsewhere, has eyes on Europe and exchanges continue to be implemented in a range of variations reduced, so that investors do not have evidence that the situation has stabilized,&quot; believes Mitsushige Akino, chief Ichiyoshi Investment Management funds.
The reappearance of the concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 hours, the European currency was worth $ 1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, has lost value after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, which met on Monday in Congress, adopted a motion which provides, in particular, the choice of a country struggling to come out of the euro area without leaving the EU.
Italian and Spanish rates are well above the 6%
Lending rates in Italy and Spain remain at levels very disturbing.
On Tuesday morning, the Italian bond yields to 10 years reached 6.85%, while Spanish titles at the same time offering 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to interest rates of the southern countries, but also from France, continue to fuel the fears of the auditors.
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has requested time for markets to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of choking under the weight of its debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece Lucas Papademos, meanwhile said that the implementation of decisions taken at the Summit of the euro area on 27 October would be the &quot;main task&quot; of his government.
Spain is in the crosshairs of the markets, while Sunday will be held legislative elections there.
The difference of the types (&quot;spread&quot;) between the 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain, has reached a new high.
In anticipation of the growth performance of euro area
From the statistical point of view, France has recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, ie, an amount more favorable than expected 0.3%, driven by domestic consumption.
INSEE, however, has revised downwards the figure in the second quarter, down from 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is what really worries economists.
Germany, meanwhile, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
Provides the first estimates for the entire euro area at 11 hours after the European Commission has warned about the risk of another recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must be worth more than the dogmas
If there is an issue that can not be treated taking into account short-term considerations or just thinking about the emotions, is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is appropriate that an election meeting is a time to reflect on these issues and on the role of nuclear energy.
The debate will be useful only if you study all the economic, social and environmental impacts of the proposed options.
The French must base his opinion on objective facts in rational data.
Now that we are 7,000 million people worldwide, demographic change will mean a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless otherwise deprive a huge part of the world&#39;s vital.
At the same time, we must alleviate the increasing shortage of fossil resources to keep producing electricity continuously, not to mention the urgent need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to combat climate change, an issue that has vanished from the debate ecological.
Fukushima&#39;s accident does not modify any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany stands alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
That is not the case or of Belgium, who submits his to the need to find a source capable of replacing, or Switzerland, which only aims to build next-generation plants.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few, go ahead with their projects with determination.
The U.S., meanwhile, after Fukushima decided to add a drive to your park, taking up the construction of a disrupted following the accident at Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, sometimes presented as an example, the reality is against such a discourse.
The choice of Berlin will mean a rise in the price of electricity, greater energy dependence for the increased need for imported gas, particularly from Russia, an increase of CO2 emissions from the construction of gas plants and coal.
Within months, the adverse effects will be felt.
You must meditate on the case of Denmark.
European Champion in the wind sector, which gets 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas because of the intermittency of wind, therefore, CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% ​​and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the perseverance of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an electric bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and guarantee the maintenance of the utility industry in the country, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction of nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in electricity prices, which detract from realism to the wonderful statements about the re-industrialization of our country and defending our purchasing power.
This is a price that most of the French refuse to pay and, in fact, show no principled opposition to that kind of energy, polls show.
Recall that the energy policy of our country has lost an industrial building with 125,000 jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs manager.
Largely export oriented, it covers a galaxy of specialized SMEs in international markets and create jobs that can not be relocated.
If France decides to abandon nuclear energy, would mean the sacrifice of many of these SMEs and the loss of 6,000 million euros a year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What an EPR electrical charge designed to work sixty years, when it is expected the collapse of its manufacturer?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, we must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity, any more than there is a diabolical source.
The development by Areva of solutions with low CO2 emissions, nuclear and renewable demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of security.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict control and transparency on both existing plants and on the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, at Three Mile Island was in normal operating conditions, did not cause or consequences to persons or to the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and about unpardonable human error.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which killed tens of thousands.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as did the previous two.
Thanks to these developments and cooperation between security authorities and operators and builders French and German, the EPR has a design able to withstand such events.
As you study all electric players who want to build a plant, the disruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for Areva and EDF&#39;s competitors, since they leave the way free to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogma and partisan maneuvering dominate such an important debate to the economic, social and financial of our country.
Immigration, does a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
Immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized starting from different points of view: the saturation of law enforcement, judicial and administrative policy under the figures, the compatibility of this policy with a self-proclaimed status of &quot;country of rights human &quot;in France.
More recently, the administrative harassment of foreign students has jumped to the holders, the Minister of Interior (see newspaper Libération 23 May) passed proclaiming that France &quot;does not need foreign talents, workers and waiters.&quot;
However, rarely is analyzed from the economic point of view.
The point is that, on this subject, there is enough consensus between left and right.
For the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation in 1976 stating that &quot;900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with nearly two million migrant workers,&quot; while on the left, set the tone as Michel Rocard explaining that France &quot;can not take care of all the misery of the world&quot; in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both left and right shared fear of invasion of national territory by a crowd of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, it is considered that immigrants are a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In its program, François Hollande only includes trivia, indicating that the co-development will solve the &quot;problem of migration.&quot;
This idea of ​​immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps electorally profitable, but is very costly economically.
As noted by economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book that summarizes the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.) there is broad consensus among scholars about the positive impact of migration on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
The limitation of immigration undermines growth and hurts employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace domestic workers, particularly low-skilled, pushing for a reduction of their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are complementary rather than substitutes for local workers and professions engaged mainly in sectors with unemployment.
Low-skilled migrants working in sectors that do not attract national workers and more skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not satisfy the demand for labor.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country with lack of anesthetists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter have a positive influence on wages and employment of nationals.
Given this, Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1% increase of migration flows is a rise in real wages in the long run of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, regardless of the fact that immigrants bring diversity contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized U.S. Nobel laureates and companies like Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants also are net contributors to social systems, since they provide an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimated, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who arrives with an age of 30 years made a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of € 150,000 on public budgets on average during a lifetime.
Early in his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to find the points of growth that was missing &quot;with teeth&quot;.
These teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, you just have to think of a European democracy
Democracy is precious, but fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember it because, although invented in Athens over two thousand years, throughout the twentieth century has suffered the tragedies of World War I, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may believe that for democracy to triumph over his enemies certainly would be enough vote and the most direct way possible.
We know, from Napoleon &quot;the Little&quot;, which thought it was something.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient on its own and can even become an &quot;instrument of oppression,&quot; as former Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, public spirit, values, organization, control and separation of powers, an education, Lights, economic solidarity and social justice.
The crisis we are living in Europe is an economic crisis, but is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The recantation of the referendum was true-false Greek in this respect, revealing a double effect: it showed the need for a strong comeback from the political sphere, but also the disturbing sense of the impossibility, in his inconsistency.
Consideration should be given to overcome this ambivalence.
The truth is that the front lines of battle have moved now democratic and, in many cases, soldiers no longer Republicans are moving in the right direction.
It will gain if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to the needs and disorganized.
A carte blanche to all European monarch or a high vacuum nationalist hole: what options for the public!
No, we do not take dramatic effects, but a common exercise, full, quiet and steady, options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, would not know where to end the list), because there is only a crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is that folds under the command of the markets and rating agencies that they have their impotence and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is suffering the humiliation in the international arena.
We care about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but Europe is slowly losing the sovereignty and with it, each of their nations.
The most urgent is that popular sovereignty recover the helm of the European project.
For only together can the Europeans to reduce the weight of debt, free markets and prepare for their future through investment.
The output of the crisis will require decisions at European level can not be taken without full democratic legitimacy unless it is to lead to disaster.
Having long struggled against this proposal of the socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone now asks European economic governance.
So be it.
But think of it without further political integration and democratic, without being experienced as such by the citizens, would be a new craze and would lead to a new impasse.
We must assume a new phase of European integration.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to &quot;do&quot; Republicans.
The Revolution would not be motivated enough interest.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from the economic point of view.
Only be achieved by building a more democratic in the political arena, a true popular sovereignty in Europe.
To build Europe, Europeans do.
Chip cards &quot;contactless&quot; generalize
The living world of chip cards starts Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic mood.
In fact, the year 2011 should end with a 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, mobile SIM cards, etc..), With a total of 6,000 million units, according to estimates Eurosmart cabinet.
The strongest segment is the contactless technology, which allows common pay transportation or purchases by simply waving the card to a reader.
This year will be sold worldwide 460 million contactless smart cards, 320 million more than last year!
Their share should continue to increase in 2012 (provides 580 million units) and represent about 10% of the global market for smart cards (6,925,000 cards).
Europe, which has long been lagging behind the Asia-Pacific, is gaining ground in the field of contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa credit cards already have this function, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: it is using 400,000 contactless Visa cards.
But the work of four superstores.
Carrefour has issued this year 2.5 million MasterCard contactless cards Pass.
To put the top up, however, banks have to make them available to their customers.
&quot;There are two major French institutions that have pledged to spread systematically in the future, among its customers, bank cards equipped with contactless system,&quot; announces Nébouy Gérard, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks try to pay by mobile phone
But only is a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) necessary to perform transactions.
&quot;They are falling behind.&quot;
&quot;But should finally experiencing a real boom in the coming year.&quot;
&quot;We expect to be sold between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 worldwide,&quot; said Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But banks take the lead.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a trial between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhone will be equipped around 200 customers and partners with a cover that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday it is preparing the marketing of a range that allows customers to pay without contact through your mobile.
Sahara to Nigeria, the growing terrorist front
Paris is concerned about links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram.
The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram, on which has long suspected has been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, including Algiers and said &quot;is certain.&quot;
&quot;The way in which both organizations operate and the reports of the intelligence services show that they are cooperating,&quot; he said, without providing further details.
Paris seems to reach a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French nationals in Niger in January would have resumed the runways.
Abducted at a restaurant in Niamey by persons connected with AQIM, Antoine Vincent Delory Léocour and died the next day along with several of his captors during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chip belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The study indicates calls made to various partners based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers caught especially the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained long in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, home of Boko Haram, and the other a man who supposedly is close to AQIM and the sect.
&quot;This is progress, but certainly we expect to have more formal tests before we talk about operational cooperation between AQIM and Boko Haram.&quot;
&quot;But it&#39;s possible.&quot;
&quot;We have known for years that the sect enjoys financial and intellectual support abroad and is increasingly active,&quot; says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these &quot;supporters&quot; had become increasingly evident in the evolution and the speeches of Boko Haram or its operating modes, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices increasingly complex and the same style as those used by AQIM.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pushing to Abuja to take into account the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, take time considering the group as a community of enlightened little worthy of interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist Imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in Hausa, &quot;Western education is a sin&quot;), encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the north Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing a rapid success.
Becomes politicized and demands strict observance of Sharia, while its members are released to the fight against the central government ungodly.
These are aimed primarily to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and multiplied attacks against police stations.
The reaction of Abuja was, as usual, general.
The army attacked the city and there were 800 deaths.
Yusuf Mohammed, arrested in life, received the death in prison.
Since then, more radical sect and abandoned their strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, claimed an attack that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram attack again against Abuja, particularly protected against the headquarters of the police, a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations became his first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, stretching from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, restless all security specialists.
While AQIM attacked Mali and Niger and the Somali Al-Chebab operating in Kenya, Boko Haram as a new threat emerges in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppe has warned against Boko Haram and said he was willing to &quot;share all the information.&quot;
The World According to Republican candidates for President
Regarding China, with Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
An America weakened by the crisis, can manage a complex world with simple ideas, or even simplistic?
Listening to Republican candidates for president, voters might think so.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates are becoming more thunderous statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strength.
They range slogans, often infundamentados on China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the candidate best placed in the race for the nomination by the &quot;Grand Old Party&quot;, has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce &quot;by manipulating its currency,&quot; a key issue in an exasperated by America migration of entire chunks of your industry to Asia.
No matter if it means the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated view of foreign policy, almost choked with an attitude that &quot;overwhelms&quot; the emotions.
Requested a strong dialogue, but constructively with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who get stuck in the depths of the surveys, remains inaudible.
Reagan-style
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
&quot;If I&#39;m elected, I will stop Iran,&quot; he bragged.
&quot;If Obama is re-elected, will have the bomb.&quot;
Also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed their duties in relation to that partner.
The businessman Herman Cain, the second highest ranked candidate, meanwhile shows a shameful disregard such issues.
Recently urged to counter China&#39;s military threat because Beijing &quot;aims to develop nuclear capability,&quot; apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he, meanwhile, is ready to deploy U.S. forces in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, also advocated Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
There are considerable differences with the Republican candidate in 2008, John McCain, a foreign policy heavyweight.
Opponents counter that the current President Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War.
Remember that Obama himself was an amateur and had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They insist, rightly, on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, in the hasty departure of the &quot;boys&quot; of Iraq and its distortions in Libya, and labeled as weak.
But the attacks are not simple.
People judged a rather positive balance Obama&#39;s national security, which ended with bin Laden.
From Iraq, wary of military interventions that generate a sink.
And, arguing that America needed to revive economically rebuild its leadership, Obama seems to be more fair.
The Nord Stream, new front door for Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which connects directly to Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea bottom has already been commissioned.
Gas be supplied to meet the needs of thirty million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
On Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, participated on the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a fine buffet, at the opening of Nord Stream, the new pipeline that connects directly under Sea, Russia and Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, together have turned the wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas network Western Europe.
With this new pipeline will arrive each year 27.5 million cubic meters of additional Russian gas to Western Europe through the first was of 1,224 miles that connect the region of St. Petersburg in Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be completed in late 2012 that will provide a total of 55,000 million cubic meters of gas, ie, enough to cover the French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube by the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge work presents an air of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow supply gas directly to Germany, avoiding over land by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, will be more difficult to influence Russia threatening to block his access to the markets of Western Europe.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a &quot;new Germano-Soviet pact,&quot; referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of European energy, since the project has created a gap between the European East and West.
Russia has managed, in just five years, to succeed his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large consumers of gas and with reserves dwindling.
&quot;This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically unites us,&quot; confirmed François Fillon at the opening of the pipeline, demonstrating how big contracts in the gas sector are as politically and economically.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the directors of Gazprom, many in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The tube is made of steel submarine cement coated to protect against ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from World War II.
&quot;It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution,&quot; said Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream.
It also became necessary extreme measures of protection of fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake weighs 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted along its length, either by valves, or for maintenance stations.
He provided a control platform in Swedish waters, but the project leaders renounced it to see that the Swedes were unwilling to allow a Russian state company was established permanently in the sea off their coasts.
&quot;In case of failure, interrupt the flow of gas in less than a minute,&quot; says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas pipeline is released, therefore, to the atmosphere.
But the builders considered unlikely that a leak occurs, as planned joints that are projected to have a flight every 100,000 years.
State control of the pipeline is ensured by a robot submarine, carried by a ship, which carries out inspections outside and through a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
With a pure form, is introduced inside the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
On arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, to provide accurate records possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline is designed to run for fifty years without any servicing.
Gas circulation is ensured simply by pressure.
The top is 200 bars and 100 bars output.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader is Gazprom, which holds 51% stake.
She joined the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), and the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, responsible for building and operating the pipeline.
Headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where the imposition is particularly favorable.
Then that company Gazprom rented for a period of twenty-five years renewable, the total transport capacity of gas.
&quot;A Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transport,&quot; says Jens Müller.
The financing of the pipeline construction has been carried out by 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7,400 million euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are assured that their investment will not exceed, as Gazprom alone assumes the risk of the expenses.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted pines.
Valves, with 4.5 meters high, form the output port of the gas.
There are sensors that measure pressure, temperature and the specific characteristics of gas on arrival, before being transferred to the German gas pipeline.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
At full capacity, will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a book mark.
Founded half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people a taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable with its black rectangular pasta, its rubber, its off-white sheets, and aged by time.
However, Moleskine notebooks were born with the current look ... in 1997.
Mode Mode The Italian company, based in Milan, decided at that moment to launch a notebook design, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, who was then a consultant to the company, was responsible for launching the new product.
The book is inspired by an ancient technique of production, mole skin (mole skin), which refers to a painted cotton was used, among other things, to cover the sidewalks.
This type of book was highly praised by writers and travelers.
&quot;Moleskine has adapted to modern tastes and forgotten an old object, an icon of the avant-garde artists to the twentieth century,&quot; says Maria Sebregondi, which since then became responsible for the brand in mode mode.
And achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Production has been far confidential the early years, in which only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italy&#39;s borders and exports its products to 70 countries from France to America.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like the Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers at its inception, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and one in New York.
Distributes its books in bookstores, from the Fnac to small businesses in the inner cities, and has learned to establish their identity.
&quot;We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of e-mails,&quot; says Maria Sebregondi.
This firm culture goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition &quot;Detour&quot; where architects and artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, also launched a notebook with leopard caps to mark the Locarno Film Festival.
Building on its success and the cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify their products: bags, notebooks, pens, computer cases ... The brand covers a wide range of media.
This success causes envy in autumn 2006, Mode mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, to be written a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers is still so high?
About 19% of disabled people are seeking a job.
The fifteenth week for the employment of the disabled begins today.
Despite a resolute public policy, applied since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people double the average rate: 19% versus 9% for the whole population.
Discouraging ¿?
&quot;No,&quot; said Eric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, the association which organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
&quot;The progress made since the last fifteen years are considerable.
&quot;Back then, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than average.
&quot;However, there is still much to do.&quot;
It is noteworthy that the unemployed disabled still face numerous obstacles in accessing employment.
They usually have a later age: 37% are over 50 years (17% on average).
They have a slightly elevated level of qualification: 80% have not finished high school and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, the long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
That is, there are many difficult issues especially the return to work and that &quot;constitute the crux of the problem,&quot; said Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help businesses to hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those that are not mentioned, the mentality of people moving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the Association for IMS-Entreprendre Cite respondents stated that the directors have &quot;a level of knowledge about disabilities under&quot; with an &quot;over-representation of people in wheelchairs, poor physical or intellectual.&quot;
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of recruiting 6% of disabled workers, a goal that was set in a law of ... 1987.
According to the latest figures available, dating from 2008, reaching a ratio of 2.6%.
&quot;Now reach around 3%,&quot; says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The proof: the establishment number &quot;under this provision&quot;, as the amounts paid have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
&quot;The 2005 law that increased contributions, has generated a lot of pressure for companies,&quot; explains Pierre Blanc.
&quot;But this improvement also reflects a true awareness, particularly among large groups.&quot;
According to the Ministry of Labor, only 59% of companies with between 20 and 49 workers with employees with disabilities in its workforce, compared with 82% of companies with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: &quot;A joy&quot;
About to face the Blues on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens not hide the pleasure that generates this friendly match.
We dare not say that it showed collusion between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side, on the stage of the auditorium of Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made up.
Five months after the act of spite of its front against Turkey, Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
&quot;I was glad to Eden, their progress and because it&#39;s Belgian.&quot;
&quot;I want to move forward,&quot; replied the front of Lille.
As the contrast between their presentations on your computer and in the selection, &quot;is a whole&quot; has been justified.
&quot;In Lille, I am all year, which does not apply to Belgium.
&quot;I have to place myself.&quot;
Summoned to play against Romania on Friday night, considering the game against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis, at last, &quot;shine&quot;.
Without forgetting the &quot;pleasure&quot;.
Take encouraging Bleus since I was seven years and during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
&quot;I&#39;ve always been her fan,&quot; he says.
Undoubtedly, this will especially strengthen the character &quot;particular&quot; of the meeting.
Especially because they face &quot;Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami),&quot; he recalls.
&quot;We just deal with recently.
&quot;Playing against them is always a joy.&quot;
With simplicity, Leekens has done its part referring to &quot;pride&quot;.
&quot;Pride&quot; to spare &quot;a charity match.&quot;
&quot;Pride&quot; also by check, such as &quot;neighbor&quot;, that France &quot;is again a very senior team&quot;, about a year after the trauma of Knysna.
&quot;Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job,&quot; he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium did not attend the next European competition, the coach would be happy to share aircraft with the Blues to ... Brazil, in 2014.
&quot;Our little Belgians are growing,&quot; he said.
&quot;We are building something, the players are ambitious, hungry.
&quot;They can see it in the next games.&quot; Including the game against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Paulo Bento&#39;s Portugal is faced with great optimism the return match against Bosnia (22.00), to be held in Lisbon on Tuesday.
In the first leg, lacked realism to both teams.
&quot;When these 90 minutes elapsed, we are a happy team and, above all, a happy country.&quot;
Paulo Bento is now in Poland and Ukraine.
No doubt, the Seleccao, which runs from September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a match play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Considering the first leg (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it appears that things are not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for over an hour, yes, but failed to score the precious goal that had been quiet.
&quot;It&#39;s a good result, but also carries a risk, since they do not have set out from home.&quot;
But at home, in the light Stadium of Light in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced they will, to an audience that should be just as excited, even if it is clear that the party is &quot;very tight&quot;, dixit an optimistic but Bento lucid.
&quot;We hope the party is very close, but we are fully convinced that we can get ahead,&quot; said the Portuguese coach of 42 years.
&quot;We still have a 50% chance to participate in Euro 2012,&quot; has, however, downplayed the successor to Carlos Queiroz.
The draw Friday in Bosnia forced the Portuguese to score and win.
For the Bosnians could get a draw, although they need to score.
&quot;It&#39;s a good result, but also carries a risk, since they do not have set out from home,&quot; laments Bento.
&quot;We are playing against a team that has a high technical quality and that you have quality players with great individual,&quot; he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention to exercise, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to &quot;leave no time to think.&quot;
A good idea, provided that this time, be realistic.
