A republican strategy to prevent the re-election of Obama
The republican leaders justified their policy by the necessity to fight against the electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers this last myth and affirms that the electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States that the number of people who die because of the fall of a ray.
In fact, the republican lawyers have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
A thing is certain: those new dispositions will affect negatively to the rate of participation.
In that sense, these measures will mine the American democratic system partly.
Unlike which it happens in Canada, the American states are responsible for the organization of the federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line a majority of the American governments promulgated, as of 2009, new laws that made difficult the voting or inscription process.
This phenomenon has extended after the elections of November of 2010, that saw the increase of 675 new republican representatives in 26 states.
Consequently, during year 2011 180 projects of law were introduced that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws demand that the voters present an identity card with a photography, besides a test of American citizenship.
On the other hand, those laws reduce the periods of advance vote, invalidate the right to register as electing in the day of the scrutiny and retire their right to the vote to the citizens with criminal records.
Before the elections of 2006, no American state demanded that the voters presented an identity card with photography.
The State of Indiana was first in demanding it.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the consitutionality of the law of Indiana.
For this reason, the republican authorities hurried to extend that practice to other states.
In the last years these authorities have supported projects of law in 34 states to force the voters to present an identity card with photography.
It is important to consider that, unlike which he happens in Quebec, the American citizens do not have a universal identity card, like the card of the Social Security.
In fact, a 11% of the American citizens, that is to say, 21 million people in age to vote, do not count on any identity card with photography emitted by a governmental agency of their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity card with those characteristics.
But, often, the obtaining of the required identity card hill more than one hundred dollars.
Consequently, the new restrictions in a disproportionate manner affect the young people, the minorities and the people with low income.
Indeed, a 25% of Afro-American, a 15% of people who less than gain 35,000 dollars to the year, a 18% of the citizens of more than 65 years and a 20% of the voters among 18 and 29 years do not count on an identity card with photography.
And still there is more.
In many states the students, the voters who vote more to the democratic candidates, cannot use the identity card with photography emitted by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states authorize to the members of the hunting or fishing clubs that usually vote to the republican parties to use documents issued by these clubs.
Before 2004 no state it demanded the test of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state in presenting this exigency.
From a 2011, dozen of states it has adopted laws that they demand that the voters demonstrate that they are citizen Americans.
Those measures look for, clearly, to limit the Hispanic vote.
Apparently two of each three Hispanic voters support to the democratic party.
On the other hand, the republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws that abolished the inscription of voters the same day of the scrutiny in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of the people and the groups to create a service of aid to the voters who wanted to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the general elections of 2004, the campaigns of inscription of the voters contributed to the registry of around 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted from 2009 obtained that the rate of inscription of new voters fell in 2010 in comparison with year 2006.
In addition, the republican legislators adopted laws in other five states that in advance favored the reduction of the period of vote.
For example, in the elections of 2008 in Florida, a 33% of the voters who voted in advance were Afro-American, whereas these last ones did not represent more than a 13% of the voters of the state.
In the case of the Hispanics it happened the same exactly.
These do not represent more than a 11% of the voters, which is equivalent to a 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.
Nevertheless, the targets, that represent a 76% of the electorate, do not represent more than 46% of the citizens who vote in advance.
By all means, the democratic legislators and their those in favor have been against fervent to the adoption of laws that restrict the registry of voters.
In this sense, the democratic governors have blocked several projects of law.
The Fiscal Ministry of the United States took part to suspend the controversial laws more.
It was possible, partly, to be limited the damages.
For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law that demanded the presentation of an identity card with photography.
Nevertheless, he is undeniable that the new adopted rules will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
The democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have vowed, since it is clear that with them it tries itself to influence in the results of 2012 in the states nails.
A report of the Brennan Center of 2011 demonstrates that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes necessary in the electoral school to obtain the presidency.
It is too much soon for affirming with certainty if these legislative modifications concerning electoral system will have a significant impact in the results of the presidential elections of 2012.
A thing is certain: those new dispositions will affect negatively to the rate of participation.
In this sense, the measures will mine the American democratic system partly.
Detection of the prostate cancer: To become the test or not to become it?
Indeed, the PSA test presents, sometimes, erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to realise useless medical interventions.
It is a reason than more sufficient to make doubt to the men, or reticent of in case, on if would have to become or not they tests of detection.
To become the test or no?
We have asked advice two specialists.
In the studies realised in the United States a great index of contagions between the sample groups was detected, reason why it is difficult to process those data and to make firm recommendations.
On the other hand, the European study showed certain difference of mortality between the patients who had been realised the detection and those that no.
The study, with a pursuit to the 12 years, demonstrated in addition that it exists between the 30 and 40% of possibilities of suffering metastasis if the detection test has not been realised.
I recommend, therefore, the test as of the 50 years, or the 40 years if your father has undergone prostate cancer.
The men of Afro-American origin have an index of elevated risk more.
The key is to make a good decision once detected the cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is truly necessary to obtain that the patient includes the degree of risk of his cancer. Him all the options possible are due to offer and not necessarily to deal with the cancers prostate that do not attempt against the long term life, in which case is due to decide rather on an active monitoring of the disease.
Nowadays many men to whom a cancer has been detected to them not are treated, since this cancer is not aggressive nor involves a risk for its life.
In its place, we suggested an active monitoring to them of the disease and, if this one progresses, we offer a treatment to them.
We every time determine with more frequency criteria precise to decide who would have or not to be treated.
I recommend that the test is made in any case.
But it is important that it speaks with his doctor to determine if the test or no. must become.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the Society the International of Urology, a tool that allows to evaluate the pros and the cons of the PSA test.

To prevent the disease
Unfortunately, a miraculous prescription does not exist to prevent the cancer.
In spite of the progresses of the investigations, the adoption of healthful habits of life continues being the best way to reduce the risks of suffering the disease.
We consider that if everybody ate well and the sufficient thing moved, would be possible to be prevented a 30% with the cancers.
“If nobody smoked, that rate would rise, at least, to 50%”, it emphasizes André Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Society against the Cancer.
However, we evaluated that around 10% of the cancers they are hereditary.
Many others totally continue being inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society against the Cancer, the fight against tobacco addiction continues being a priority in spite of the diminution of the number of smokers.
The tobacco is tie with 85% of the cases of the lung cancer.
It constitutes, in addition, a factor of risk for other types of cancers.
It enormously harms the health of the people.
“At the present time, still there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec”, declared the spokesman André Beaulieu.
A hopeful data: 10 years after stopping smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced to half.
The weight
The obesity and the obesity also favor the appearance of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of uterus and pancreas, esophagus, rectum and colon, breast cancer.
“The investigations demonstrate that the regular practice of physical activity during all the life protects against the breast cancer”, they add.
The feeding
The organism recommends, also, to limit the consumption of red meats.
In great amounts, they make scale the risks of undergoing a rectocolonic cancer.
The charcuterie products also must be avoided.
The conservation of the meat for its smoking, drying or salt meat can bring about the carcinogenic substance formation.
“They can damage the cells of the organism and to take to the development of the cancer”, they explain to us.
Vitamins
In the last years, several scientists have studied the bonds between the vitaminic complexes and the cancer.
Nevertheless, at the moment their investigations are not conclusive.
Segú the SCC, the studies about the vitamin and are contradictory.
Whereas in one of them a diminution of the risks of prostate cancer was stated, in another one what it was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D in the cancer has not either been able to determine with clarity.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of speaking on the familiar restlessness and antecedents of each with their doctor.
“To make the test of detection it does not bring about cancer.”
The boson of Higgs in detail
The announcement of the probable discovery of the boson of Higgs generated a great commotion the last summer, and with reason.
It is created, indeed, that this boson is contributor of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything what exists in the universe, nothing else and anything less.
And what is more, one is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our better or “less bad” explanation of the nature and the behavior of the matter, that not yet has been observed empirically.
But for the physicists it is not totally clear that one is Higgs.
We know without doubt that a new particle exists and that it is looked much like the boson of Higgs predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new kept awake data this week in an important congress of physics celebrated in Kioto seem to confirm that yes it is it, although still lack more data to be completely safe.
Of all ways, we suppose that one is Higgs, since the possibilities of being mistaken seem few. We will see in question.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be at the same time in the same place.
There is no way to infringe that norm and it does not try it too much, because it will end up becoming damage.
Although the physics of particles is a very complex world, has demonstrated that also in her a law of these characteristics exists: the Pauli's exclusion principle, who stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same “quantum state”; a “state” that consists, approximately, of some of its characteristics.
The physicists classify particles in two categories.
On the one hand we were with the good called citizens fermions, that they obey wisely at the beginning of Pauli.
And on the other they are the bosons, a dirty group of anarchists whom respect by anything does not have, or at least not by this principle, which means that they can be in the same place and at the same time.
According to the webpage The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories that, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided in two groups: the inns, of which we will not speak here, and the “particles of force”, by which the great forces of the nature propagate and with which the boson of Higgs would be of some related form.
These bosons, would be possible to emphasize here, are not the exotic tiny beasts that we could believe.
In fact, if it manages to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the “particle of light” that it acts like “messenger” of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes of direction, “it disorders” the electromagnetic field in that precise surroundings; a little like when we sent a stone to a pool.
In this “disorder” an electromagnetic wave is born (from the light, the infrared, the ultraviolet ones, etc.), and this wave is not another thing that a photon; that is to say, one of carrying bosons “of force”.
More stable field
It happens the same with the boson of Higgs, with in question difference of another field, the field of Higgs, who needs to be “disorderly” so that this boson appears.
However, the field of Higgs is very many more stable than the electromagnetic field. In order to activate it is necessary to arrive at extremely high energies, a little as if one was a frozen pool in which only one heavy rock could slide by the surface.
For that reason it is necessary an immense particle accelerator like the one of the CERN (the great hadron collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relation between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, all the particles nor all the materials do not interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do it, but others not: a paper piece, for example, will never stay by itself patch to the door of a refrigerator.
And of the same form, all the particles do not interact with the field of Higgs: those that does it have a mass, whereas the rest (how the photon, by the way), does not have it.
However, what “can contribute” all those investigations? , Señora Plamondon asks.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and allows, in addition, that the physicists scrutinize the differences between the observations and the predictions of the MS.
On the other hand, many wish fervent that they are, because the smaller difference could open a door to a “new physics” that it covers certain holes of the model.
This, is necessary to say it, has still enormous deficiencies, because some regarding the gravity does not propose explanation (ups) or to the dark matter, that conforms around 80% of the matter of the Universe (another one ups).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN until the moment.
Repercussions
The repercussions of these investigations in our day to day are difficult to predict, but we do not think that we are mistaken when saying that it will not have any.
So that they see: at the beginning of years 60, the pioneers of the laser in the laboratories absolutely did not suspect the revolution that their works would cause.
They glimpsed the scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as the physicist Willard Boyle already said, that he worked in the Bell labs, where the laser in 1960 was invented, and that made the first continuous laser (first they were beaten) in 1962, at the outset the laser was rather considered “equipment of laboratory”.
Imagine…
And in addition, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds to the investigation.
For example, the same Willard Boyle made a receiver of light in 1969 in the course of its investigation in the matter of optical.
Although it was not absolutely his original intention, this receiver serves now as “eye” for all the digital equipment of the world, which was worth Nobel to him of physics in 2009.
That does not mean, by all means, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but never it is known…
Taken care of palliative. The best form to die… | Him Devoir
In its Commission To die in dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate question of the aim of the life.
The debate must be retaken soon while a law project is prepared.
However, within that essential dominion, still there is much to do.
Devoir has tried to see it to him close by.
Hardly some ago weeks, Mr. L. only lived in his apartment of the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a breathing of two years.
“They had given five years Me of life, but already I take thus seven”, it relates, done happens, knocked down in his bed in center of palliative cares Victor-Gadbois de Beloeil, at whom the previous day arrived.
“But always it is a shock, we cannot be preparations for this”, it continues.
The disease has caused damage to him: an enormous weakness that it prevents him to only go bathroom and to even eat by itself.
Seated in front of an appetizing lunch, it accepts resigned that helps him to eat.
Valiente, even gets to smile, to speak with the strangers who dedicate attentions to him, bring medecines to him and they offer a bath to him.
The bravery of the ordinary death.
“My greater desire is than they cure the diarrhoea to me, is humiliating”, it confesses.
Some hours later, the equipment found remedy to that evil.
“In the course of our lives we learn that a man makes piss standing up”, relates Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in center Victor-Gadbois.
To return to its childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“That depends on the capacity of the person to accept that regression”, it states.
Because, according to the opinion of the majority of the people who work in palliative cares, the great moments take place in the same heart of that regression.
All the patients who in center enter of palliative cares Victor-Gadbois suffer cancer.
They have a maximum prognosis of life of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses who surround to them no longer offer “the curative” cares.
The greater fear of Mrs A., 89 years, is to die “conscious and drowned”.
But the disease has made discover its children him.
“I have some good children”, it adds.
“No longer I have left more desires in this life”, she says, before accepting that a mask is placed to help it to him to breathe.
And it hopes, in the next days, a last visit of its son who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois it is offered, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and aid to the feeding.
They are taken care of palliative that occurs them when it is not possible to be done nothing else.
In order to help to that their death is more comfortable.
In Quebec we counted on a bed of palliative cares for each 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, since we know that all we will end up dying someday.
Here, the life continues in the best possible conditions, explains the Dra. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center.
Or concerning physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
To the dying rinsings of mouth with brandy or Pepsi are offered to him, according to the demand.
To the diabetics no longer its rate of sugar is controlled to them.
The death comprises of the daily thing.
At night we yesterday served a beer to him to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, its son was finished the beer to the feet of the deceased.
“We helped the patients as to its loved ones as much”, it relates Nathalie Savard, director of the cares.
In center Victor-Gadbois the days pass without being never equal.
Next to a man of 94 years who savors his last familiar meeting in the patio, placed well between his pillows while all drink to their health, a young person of 36 years dies of tragic form, surrounded by his parents, his wife and her two children, after to have tried it everything to survive.
“For six months, always it has of three to five beds occupied by smaller people of 45 years ill of cancer”, worries the Dra. Christiane Martel.
A 53% of the patients who are admitted in center Victor-Gadboisarrivent come from their house and a 47% of the hospital.
Problem of the access to palliative cares
A 77% of the Canadians simply do not have access to the palliative cares, that is to say, to the conceived cares to alleviate the suffering when a patient arrives at the final stage of his life, it is in its address, the hospital or a center of cares.
And several organisms, like the Victor-Gadbois center and the society of palliative cares at home of the Grand Montreal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of the patients with cancer.
It is indeed that great relative deficiency in the sanitary cares of Quebec which causes that many doctors specialized in palliative cares fear the adoption of a law that regulates euthanasia and the attended suicide.
From the month of October, a manifesto signed by eminences of the palliative cares, like the Dr. Balfour Mount and the Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to demonstrate its opposition to such initiative.
According to the Dra. Christiane Martel, the sanitary system of Quebec is not sufficiently competent like assuring that anyone has right to palliative cares of quality before it is accepted to come with euthanasia.
“Recently”, it relates, “I have seen a patient pass 14 days in Urgencies suffering great pains without the necessary thing has become to alleviate it.
I fear that the patients wish to only die because they do not receive the suitable cares”.
And in parallel, many oncologists are obstinate with their patients until the last day, in spite of the worse prognoses.
The hopes of survival of Hélène Richard were already under minimums when it left an exhausting treatment of chemotherapy.
“When I said to him oncóloga that she wanted to stop the treatment, she said to me that she gave much pain him that wanted to stop fighting”, she relates.
“Nevertheless, she had said to me that it was not necessary nothing else to do”
There are no well-taken care of omnipotent
The Dra. Martel thinks that a 90% of the patients whom they ask for to die they thank for his caretakers who have not taken care of to them in their demands once has alleviated their pain to them thanks to an equipment of palliative cares.
But it is necessary to say that the palliative cares are not absolutely all-powerful with regard to the treatment of the pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of the palliative cares at home of Grand Montreal, the patients do not respond to the treatments against the pain in a 8% of the cases.
At the end of the life, the doctors usually resort to the palliative sedation, that serves to sleep to the patient until the moment of their death, or of sporadic form or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of the suffering.
More and more, the alleviated disease is not going to have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The patients who are not alleviated say all the same: “I am wanted to die”.
But that does not mean necessarily “I want euthanasia”, but “I want that they alleviate to me”.
The accomplishment of this news article has been possible thanks to a scholarship of journalism of the institutes of investigation of health of Canada.
Real estate scandals of great amplitude in Quebec
Civil servants of the road network, businessmen of the BTP, collectors of specialistic bottoms of political parties and of the Italian Mafia count, day after day, which knows of a formidable “system”, of which construction industry, mafia civil servants, politicians, unionists comprise and.
A “industry” that it left too expensive to the Quebecker contributors, mainly in 1990 and 2000.
“He is peculiar how the system pulverizes once we have hunted to great means”, Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and old head of the Police of Montreal speaks ironically.
It led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, that was possible thanks to a thorough investigation on the embezzlements ligatures to contracts of highways in Quebec, that liberal prime minister of that moment, Jean Charest, had not allowed more than in delaying.
The “Duchesneau report” established a direct bond between the industry, the clandestine financing of the parties and the corruption between civil servants.
“From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the ministry of transports would have saved billions of dollars in contracts”, containing some of its instincts to remain with a proportional part.
The Charbonneau Commission “already has made fall to two mayors”, it adds, while it hopes to be able to arrive “to demonstrate the existing stratagems behind the individuals”.
A anti-corruption permanent unit, created in 2011
The anti-corruption permanent Unit, created in 2011, is also applied with its team of inspectors, investigators and analysts of the government.
This unit works besides the police of “the Marteau square”, that, from 2009, have done which the “cartel of the sewage system” of Montreal becomes moderate at the time of inflating contracts.
These last weeks, the unit has come to the registry in series from the accusations by fraud and corruption against municipal positions like Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city of the outskirts.
The close one to the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who finishes resigning from its position of mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec.
One suspects that one has pocketed repeated bribes in exchange for contracts public.
One has formally blamed engineers of the road network of Montreal and businessmen of Italian origin, like Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
This last one has caused to commotion when explaining to the commission the mechanics of the “system” of contract obtaining public.
He himself paid during three years a 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a related intermediary to the Mafia that transferred the money to Montreal Union, the party of mayor Gérald Tremblay.
M. Zambito distributed to money to matador and wreck during years 2000, granting more than 88,000 dollars Canadian (about 68,000 Euros) to provincial parties, mainly to the liberal ones in the power.
It admitted, also, to have organized a collection of illegal bottoms for the ex--viceprimera liberal minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
The inflation of the cost of sewage system contracts
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked with effectiveness.
Gilles Surprenant, exingeniero of public works, perfectly explained it before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to trips, matches of golf, restaurants, parties of hockey and bribes of companies of the sector of the construction by a total of 736,000 dollars, all this in exchange for sewage system contracts whose costs inflated.
Other civil servants of the road network have admitted that they received money to inflate the invoices between a 30% and a 40% for false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the party of mayor, Martin Dumont, accused a.m. Tremblay of to have made the fat view deliberately to a parallel budget and filled its coffers of drug trafficking money.
As a result of these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November and took to Montreal to an enormous crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elect policies of Montreal that made sound the alarm.
Like mayoress of the Rivière-DES-Prairies district, in the east of the island, one on sale was against from 2010 of a municipal land acquired by 5 million dollars and resold by 1.6 million the promoters in the heat of real estate boom.
70% of the money of the electoral campaigns were drug trafficking money
The investigation that finally will take to end, it assures that she throws “of a thread to be able to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and to fish to the guilty”.
And it adds that the process is “painful, but positive”.
We are cleaning the wounds but a unit would make lack of clean investigation in Montreal and be very alert so that the doubtful practices are not repeated.
How to make the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, on the other hand, declares that “the civil servants have robbed hundreds of million dollars”, but is in favor anxious mainly of the paper of '“the elect politicians to the current of the stratagem”.
Considering in a 70% the proportion of drug trafficking money that was destined to the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, it speaks ironically: “they have said to me that is not more than a pale reflection of the reality”.
The Quebecker government proposes to limit 100 dollars the donations to parties, but that will not change the donation, according to him, “while the electoral expenses are not limited strictly, will be drug trafficking money in the policy”.
A complete revision of the system of party financing and contract granting praises public: “we cannot fall lower; to go to the bottom of the things, with bravery, will allow us to reconstruct the house with some more solid bases, with more controls and laws”.
If this history dims the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites at which they are laughed to look itself at the mirror.
“The PSG is not the FC Barcelona”
This season has acquired a new organization with the PSG.
How it would explain that advance?
It would be possible to be explained by a taking of brings back to consciousness individual, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Balance sheet by day in day to its side.
The technical personnel also has contributed much to me.
And those elements on a daily basis push to me to elevate the level of my game.
In a party, that is easier.
Everything goes very fast in soccer.
But I do not get excited myself.
From my beginnings in center of preformation of INF Clairefontaine to my passage by Saint-Etienne, always I have advanced to huge steps.
It is going to obtain benefit of the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
The recruited ones of this summer are customary to dispute parties of very high level.
They know that each training is crucial.
That does that a player as I have desire to fight and to give it everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti contributes much to me as far as my positioning.
It is endorsed by associates like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position that I.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the equipment?
By all means.
Ancelotti inspires respect to all the technicians.
At the present time, there is nobody equal in League 1 and is between the best European trainers.
It has a great experience and it has gained numerous titles with the best clubs.
It has worked with great players.
I believe that one will take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I finished leaving a series of injuries.
The confidence that it has in me also explains my good yield.
What thinks on the PSG about the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyons has cleared us the leader position.
But we followed in the ambush.
One of our majors objectives is the League of champions: we have classified ourselves for eighth of end with style.
Which is the objective of the club in this competition?
We are going to try to arrive more far possible.
From now on, it can pass any thing.
But we must much say against many and very good European equipment.
We want, to begin, to finish first of our league against the Oporto to be able to receive the return of eighth of end.
Can the PSG become a great European club in the short term?
It already has the budget…
In order to become a great European club, Paris must gain titles and be there in the long term.
At the present time, that is not the case.
At economic level, the PSG is given to its means so that project takes shape.
Not to gain the glass in League 1, like in the last season, it would constitute a great failure?
By all means, it would be a great deception.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in taking that title to us of champions.
In the last season we did not arrive far.
In May we took a deception, since we counted on the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had one season strong.
We finish with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we must have been champions…
But another equipment, Montpellier, had one season rather better.
This year I believe that it will be the good one.
Even if the great equipment like Marseilles, the Lyons and the Bordeaux fights by the title, I believe that we counted on the arms to take it to us.
It thinks that the means hope more of the PSG?
It is normal that they wait for much of us if we thought about which it has been reversed in the players who we have.
We have accepted it totally.
After we gained 4-0 to Troyes at home, that still is with things that to reproach to us are a little frustrating.
We wondered what to more delay people.
We will never be able to gain 4-0 all the week ends.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We try to start up a game project.
An equipment is constructed in time.
In the League of champions we have demonstrated that we can respond and be present.
Miren al Manchester City who, after two seasons, has not managed to classify itself for eighth of end, and they also have invested very many!
In view of the invested sums, we would imagine to you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be to neglect to our adversaries and the championship of France.
Lyons and Marseilles, that were not the previous season well, have been seen “impelled” by this new PSG.
That demonstrates that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, in spite of all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy to us.
The PSG totally seems employee of the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better than we say that we have a “Zlatandependencia”.
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that it puts many goals.
It has come to demonstrate that it is the star of League 1.
And it has demonstrated in all the equipment through which it has happened that is a great player, a world-wide star.
In the group we respected to the man and the player.
And he also respects the men whom he around has to his.
What it has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes the others to increase its level of game.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders of the world, also allows that all we progress.
How you have lived Eurocopa 2012 with the equipment on France?
It has been a deception.
Very it was excited to participate in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to accumulate time of game.
I saw things there and I left reinforced.
Today profit to play good parties in the selection.
It is what hoped from my baptism with “bleus”.
We learned the lesson than it happened in the Ukraine and to it one is due that today we have an exemplary behavior.
What vision you have of the first month of Didier Deschamps to the front of “bleus”?
It is obtaining results.
Well they are located in the group of classification for the World-wide one.
The selector is rigorous, near the players and inspires to win.
As it were the case of Laurent Blanc.
But I do not want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved its objective to classify us for the Eurocopa.
I hope that Didier Deschamps takes to the selection to Brazil.
Did the tie (1-1) of the 16 of October in Spain serve to establish the bases?
That game gave confidence us.
Each fought by all.
Before that shock in Spain, a similar game in all my race had not lived.
With Bitcoin, to pay and to sell without banks
Quite the opposite to the present monetary interchanges, based on the central banks, the identified transactions and the loads of processing between the parts.
In addition, as often it happens in the technologies, the political vision is concrete: the conviction that the present monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, takes to the financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is simultaneously a convertible virtual currency to dollars, Euros, etc. and a protocol of safe change to the way of BitTorrent, that allows the interchange of files of equal to equal.
They have been registered near 200,000 transactions thanks to 15,000 computers of the network.
And near about thousand websites accept bitcoins like donations or form of payment.
The quote of bitcoin, after to have arrived at the top of 30 dollars (23 Euros) in June of 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before today returning to go up to around the ten dollars (the quotes register in the bitcoincharts.com page).
He is not nothing impressive if we compared it with the world-wide changes in real currency or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central bank (BCE) was interested in him in a report on the virtual currencies published in October.
In him, bitcoin like “the virtual currency with more success” was described, “that it competes with the dollar or the Euro” and “similar to the conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin difference of other systems with types of virtual currencies like the “credits”, used to advance in a video-game and that can be won playing or can be bought (and sometimes to even exchange).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in all interchange a central authority controls and treats the changes.
With bitcoin, all the nodes of network are simultaneously book deposit takers of accounting, verifying, emitters of currency and buyers and salesmen.
How work that does network?
Each transaction between two users is made in fact enters two-way traffic electronic in the form of e-mail.
A user can choose a different direction for each payment, guaranteeing therefore the anonymity.
A set of information ligatures to this transaction signature electronically through a system of coding to key double.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to assure that the changes of bitcoins consist in the public book of accounts, that spreads by all the network.
The fixed key consists of writing that new transaction in that book.
This he happens through the resolution of a mathematical challenge sent to the computers and the winner, a species of provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add that complementary line.
One is a divided phase of file, that is to say, transformation of a great file in a shorter and unique numerical track.
The computers “take” the new transaction and add a number before “dividing” the set.
The objective is to find the number that offers a particular track (more zero at the outset).
Once is that number, the other nodes verify easily that it is the good one.
The transaction indestructibly is then ligature to the chain of sets of the other transactions; all modification would change the track.
If, to commit a fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same very fast money (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept like valid one of the two transactions; the other would remain orphaned, since both have different tracks.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid the inflation, that reward is divided regularly in two, with probability before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is, then, limited 21 million, but they are divisible until cienmillonésimo, which leaves an ample margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase of the calculation power.
The life of the network has its bumps already.
The websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and they have robbed bitcoins in deposit.
“The used failure does not affect to the same protocol”, assures Pierre Noizat, that he finishes sending Paymium, a company of payment in real currency that uses the network Bitcoin.
The BCE considers in addition the possibilities to blanquo of money thanks to this anonymous service.
But the money in cash presents the same defect.
The actors of weight as Wikipedia rejects the payments of this type.
Others, like the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Insitito Weizmann in Israel, analyzed the accounting book and showed that near 80% of bitcoins he does not circulate.
In November the “giant reductions” were sent.
“30,000 dollars changed”, rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, that turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that currency, creates enough in the potential of this technology besides in the network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, are equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or to a payment by mobile without contact, but Bitcoin uses to validate the transactions, that thus leave more sales.
The carrier, in addition, manages its identity and can, therefore, remain in the anonymity.
The system is easy to start up in the commerces, that they do not have to install new terminals nor software.
It is enough with providing a direction to them that a telephone can “photograph and recognize”, it needs Pierre Noizat, that he assures to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of the hierarchic systems by more horizontal systems.
“It will be necessary a time so that Bitcoin prevails, but in 2013 it could have a change”, predicts.
On the other hand, in its report the BCE anticipates to revalue the diverse risks, today considered high, in case this currency is successful.
We have left Afghanistan.
And later?
The French troops left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014.
It is hour of which the Afghan army retakes possession of its territory and that the afghans choose their future, without waiting for nothing of us.
We have punished mainly the Afghan farmers, to whom we have considered terrorist.
And same, with our 88 assassinated soldiers, plus the wounded and the mutilated ones.
The talibans have foreign extremists and old heads sheltered in Pakistan, but often also with farmers who reject the presence of the foreign army, like in the times of the Soviets.
They want to defend its traditions, old and archaic, even if to their causes the jihadist ones are united, the pakistanis, the Arabs, the Uzbeks or the Tadjiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by the local insurgents, these no longer they will be it when the western ones become more discreet.
The game of the French troops of the base of Nijrab, who I observed from the stop of planted hills of almonds tree thanks to the French credits, became by order.
Convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without undergoing no attack, watched over the helicopters.
There will be affluence of no talibans in Kabul from end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed from their irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country surrounded in fire and blood because of the fights between different factions.
Its taking of control of the country had been perceived like a species of liberation, the return to the security.
The afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of their farmers exceeded by the organization To - Qaeda, but its situation is not better today.
The old mujaheddins, the present government and the present talibans share desire to maintain to the women in a position inferior.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to the power in 2001.
They have become speculators, taking control of governmental lands to on a par resell them like lots for the refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefitting from enormous American contracts of sub-contracting.
They are discredited; the majority of them has not fought.
People, according to I have heard in the field, aspires to a government who is not trained by thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as also those will go away that have known to take advantage the American generosity: the flight of capital is considerable.
The young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during his exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated his advantages.
On around a 65% of its smaller population of 25 years, Kabul counts right now with 5 million inhabitants, a fifth part of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full as much of children as of children.
It will be necessary to employ to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties nor to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opposition, are eager for mobile phones. The Turkish television and his folletines that presents a modern world has great admirers in all the country.
The army is now present.
Be considered will legitims the authorities that want to direct the country?
The old commanders of the anti-Soviet fight already worry to reconstitute the provincial militias, that will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, mountain country, of strong local identities, would have to be able to benefit from a certain decentralization to image of the western nations. Nevertheless, the United States has wanted it to transform into a centralized state, with a presidential power hard, suppressing the position of prime minister who existed from the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want the foreign control, in particular on the occasion of the elections anticipated in April of 2014.
However, its country even depends on the foreign aid from years 50 and before.
No industry has reestablished its services, has not fixed no dam nor have repaired the important systems of irrigation.
Everything is concerned and nothing takes place except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left the private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years military, the governmental control would have been necessary.
The rumor that expanded Afghanistan owned immense mining wealth.
And that did not do more than to increase the feeling of which the western ones were there for seizing of them.
Without energy to extract minerals of iron or copper of the land and without means of transport to export them through mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese already almost have left the copper mines of Month Aynak, leaving them international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) excavate the immense búdico location and remain there like the most important employers of the province.
It will also do lacks that Afghanistan and Pakistan, country on which widely depends the imports and exports, restore their normal relations.
The French troops divided the 20 of November.
The new treaty of cooperation anticipates the continuation of the traditional aid: schools of children, schools of children, a French department in the university, the French Institute, the cooperation in and agricultural military, legal, sanitary the scopes and the support to the archaeological delegation.
From 2009, with the intention of trying “to gain the hearts and the spirits” and to carry out the impossible task of causing that the aid and the offensive operations agree, a service of “civil actions and military” of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and made bring through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and action of agricultural rehabilitation in tens of mountain localities.
Those works, gourmands to obtain local manpower, have been able to help to contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, potable water, reforestation, fruit trees, solar protection and increase of culture surfaces.
What we will leave like memory after two million Euros of expenses the military?
A rather modest budget will often contribute to the improvement of the local conditions of life, very hard in those valleys located to more than 2,000 meters of height.
The Embassy received tens of demands written with small agricultural proposals realised by local communities of the province of Kapisa.
So that they free themselves of the carried out insurrection by the foreign groups, something that the farmers have said that they wish me, would make lack maintain a small civil aid, controlled well and that arrives to them directly.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing of president Mohammed Morsi.
Whereas Egypt more is divided than ever as far as the constitutional declaration, that grants powers provisionally to him plenary sessions, he decided to play the whole by the whole.
It took to everybody by surprise Wednesday, when it announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text on the following day.
Only one week ago, the Chief of State had given two months to this Assembly to more finish his works.
And almost for two years Egypt has been using a provisional text, several times modified, which debilitates the institutional stability and takes to judicial confusions.
This new initiative has not done more than to increase the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his “autocratic delirium” and continues “betraying his word” and “treading down the right”.
On the part of its those in favor, one makes sure that one is a measurement to end faster the institutional and political crisis and to accelerate the transition process.
In next the 15 days a referendum would have to be organized.
A very short time interval that forces to the Brothers to resign to its project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, one is also a form to recover a popular and democratic legitimation while the controversial cause damage in all the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote to their favor, as affirmed in an interview to the American weekly magazine Time.
Whereas clause that resource has vowed with much rapidity, contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian town: “or they vote my text or I maintain the powers plenary sessions”, powers that supposedly will arrive at their aim with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that ambient stranger in whom 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, islamist in its great majority, voted the text yesterday.
The majority of the liberal ones did not go to the call.
In the middle of November, a little before the constitutional declaration, had closed the door because they considered that their points of view could not make merit.
The representatives of the human rights, the religious minorities and of the civil society did the same.
In order that the necessary quorum was obtained, in the morning it yesterday added 11 people, members substitutes, as quickly as possible.
Some of them are very near the Muslim Brothers.
As it were possible to hope, the voted articles it have been unanimously.
To the commentators it does grace to them, on the other hand, the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed practically at the time of the oration, as much is so several members of the committee got to think that the clock of the Component was bad.
The text, that behind schedule was yesterday still being voted, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, object of all the glances, finally continues being identical the one of the Constitution of 1971, that stipulated that “the principles of the Sharia constitute the main source of the right”.
The Salafist parties, for those who the establishment of the Islamic law is a fundamental vindication, hoped that the principles” by “the norms” could be replaced “, which had allowed a stricter application.
For the islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of its good will and its respect towards the other components of the Egyptian society.
The liberal ones erase it of hypocrisy and consider that it is not than an advertising ruse more.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution becomes through other articles.
They talk about, especially, to the article 220, that confers to the University To - the Azhar a consultative paper, in particular for all that one that there is to confirm its conformity with the laws of the Sharia.
According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is disquieting because “called people to pronounce itself are not chosen and she does not have any democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpsed the premises of a theocracy”.
The fears of the liberal ones see in addition increased because the next director of this university would be rather less moderate than the present one.
“So far, there is no a concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the marital status.
The majority of the jurists who are working in that text is not ulemas but university, some of trained them in the French system”, explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But it recognizes that it can have certain ambiguity around article 220, because the used terms imitate the religious vocabulary.
“We talked about in particular to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, editorial note].
And the question that could consider in the future would be to what extent they are the competent civil judges to pronounce itself over all this”.
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many critics that talk about to the extended powers that the president of the Republic confers.
The Muslim Brothers will allege that they are few in comparison with which they were during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred to the army.
According to the desire of the military, the revision of the budget of Defense will not be put under the Parliament, but a national advice of defense.
The processings of civilians in military courts will not be prohibited either, as they requested the associations for the defense of the human rights.
These also showed their restlessness regarding the text, that consider liberticida.
The blasphemy crime stays and, from now on, the insults are prohibited, which could cause serious consequences for the freedom of expression, mainly the one of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of the women, emphasizes Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive has been the prohibition of the torture in agreement with article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president had to appear at night yesterday in the television, anticipates manifestations for this noon.
Those in favor of the Chief of State indicated Saturday.
In Israel, to the Ukrainian tourists they wait for the Earth to them santa, the navel of the world and a brine sea
The engaged Earth combines the majesty of the Biblical truths with the modern comfort and a pristine nature.
“the AIF” identified the five more important reasons by those than Israel is due to visit.
Reverence in Tierra Santa
It is worth the pain to visit the Jordán river where Jesus was baptized.
One thinks that whatever enters in this “baptismal font” will receive the divine grace.
And Galilea, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the wine water conversion in the wedding, to walk on waters, the pacification of the storm and the filled networks.
In this same place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greater amount of holy places is in Jerusalem.
The believers cross here the Viacrucis or the Way of Cruz de Jesús (in Latin “Vía Dolorosa”).
It begins in the Strength of Antonio, Pretorio, where the judgment was realised, and continues by the streets of the Old City, goes to Santo Sepulcro in Monte Gólgota, the place of the crucifixion, to the Stone of the Unction and the place of grave of Jesus.
In this same place also is the symbolic Christian Navel of the world, that symbolizes the salvation of the humanity.
And the monastery of Santa Cruz in Jerusalem, constructed in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree of which the cross for the crucifixion of Jesus became.
In Jerusalem also is the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wailing Wall; the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 DC.
As it is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with her desires, that soon will be made reality.
To realise a vertical trip
The ruins of the Masada Strength were what it was of a secret refuge against the enemies, who Herodes the Great one commanded to construct in year 25 a. C. for its family.
They are in cliffs of mountain to a height of 450 ms on the sea level.
And to arrive until there by their own means, only those can that are dedicated to the scaling.
The others can arrive at this historical summit in the funicular one.
And in the north from the country to an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermón, where in the months of winter there is a great affluence of tourists.
Until there, from the foot of the hill services of bus are offered.
The length overall of the ski tracks is of 45 km.
According to one old legend, in the top of the mountain supposedly they inhabited pagan Gods.
To visit unique museums
In this country it has around 300 museums.
In a single trip you will not be able to visit them all.
But it is worth the pain to visit five of them, at least most interesting.
Among them it is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In him the old Manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Rollos de Qumrán are conserved, shortages in the caves of the desert of Judea, and around 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth the pain to visit the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his painting exhibition Monet counts on linen cloths of expressionist impresionists and such as, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre it is possible to be visited museum-I bathe To the Basha, that is some rooms of old Turkish baths with figures model of visitors and swimmers of that one time.
In Caesarean it is worth the pain to happen through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí can be admired.
There there are tour guides nor no stores of suvenires.
The entrance is free, and categorically donations are not accepted.
Fifth, the Museum of Holocausto or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section is the Memorial of the children, constructed in memory of the 1.5 million children assassinated in gas chamber and the concentration camps.
You enter him and you are in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And they sound to the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they were killed.
The Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist zones of Israel are to borders of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, aquatic, delfinarios parks and oceanographic museums.
He is peculiar that in the Red Sea even bathes in the months of winter, since the temperature of the water does not lower of the 21 degrees and the air is warmed up until the 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is still more warm and there they bathe throughout the year.
By the way, this sea, most extraordinary in the world, is more in the point under the planet: to 417 ms under the sea level.
The blue waters of are a brine there that easily maintain until a those that they do not know to swim.
The landscapes of the environs are truly beautiful.
People arrive here to pass courses of treatment with salt water, get sick of too much salt and curative mud and to fortify her health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to in sequence put his broken nerves.
Touching the mysteries of the antiquity
The conserve the old part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, in the Mediterranean coast.
Through her it passed the famous sea lane that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the old Greek and Egyptian legend.
According to account the legend, was here where Noah constructed his coffer and Perseo rescued to the beautiful Andrómeda with that, in this same place, took one long and happy life.
To the tourists it enchants to them to take a walk by the narrow streets that take the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if headresses the walls in the street of your “same” symbol, the fortune will be to you favorable.
In Jaffa it is possible to be found pairs of just married that they come from all parts of Israel, and of other countries to even photograph itself.
And in Caesarean, the city of king Herodes, can be taken a walk by the Roman theater, “be taken” the strength from the crusaders.
At the Roman, Caesarean time it was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman solicitors, including Poncio Pilato.
The theater, carefully recovered, is now used for concerts nocturnes and spectacles of opera.
Tourists remember
If it travels to Israel, one does not worry if his English leaves much to be desired: in this country around 30% of the population it speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommendable to take it in Euros, but in dollars, that can easily be changed shéquels (at the moment 1-3$, 8 shéquels).
The urban transport is made up the buses mainly, but in Jerusalem there is fast street car and in Haifa is the only line of meter of the country, that consists of six stations and connects the Low City with the High City.
In fact, it is of a funicular subterranean.
To travel in any type of public transport hill 6 shéquels and by this price can be traveled transferring during 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to the Jewish tradition, Saturdays the Sabbat is celebrated.
From the night of Friday to the putting of the sun of Saturday, markets and stores close and the public transport interrupts its work.
But Sunday in the morning begins a new workweek.
In many coffees, restaurants and hotels kosher food only be served, that excludes meat from pig, seafood, fish without grudges and plates in which milk and meat are combined.
There an ample plate selection is offered with meat of cow and lamb, soups and desserts preparations with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, great variety of sauces, faláfel, that are balls of ground chick-pea, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of the Israeli cities street dogs do not see themselves.
However, there are many fed cats good that “take a walk to their taste” of imposing way.
At night you can even see sleeping them over the ceilings of the parked cars.
To the ronroneadores the concurred places enchant to them and they do not reject the treats.
The rent of a car, following the brand, will cost of 37$ (Hyundai Getz) to 188$ (Audi A6, Volvo S80) to the day.
Besides the insurance, that leaves by 15$ to the day.
And the rent of a bicycle will leave by 15 shéquels the day to him.
The entrances to the museums cost an average of 30 shéquels.
Israel in numbers
In 2012 they visited Israel more than three million tourists worldwide.
The majority of that they arrived to cross the country and to rest was citizen of EE.UU., Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the Ukraine.
Tierra Prometida, of January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, amount that surpasses in a 51% to the same index of year 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime the 9 of February of 2011.
“Great and the powerful one” will take to you until Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While deputies and defenders of the human rights discuss on the consequences that the law would bring on the obligatory examination, they have already appeared in the country crooks that deal with “false” certificates
Every year, 13 million working immigrants arrive at Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
In its majority they are citizen of countries of central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its only objective is to make money to help its families who have remained at home.
From the 1 of December a law enters in force, according to which each labor immigrant will have to realise an examination to verify his knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule is applicable only for that they have the intention to work in the sector of benefit of services, domestic institutions of communitarian services, services and commerce retail.
Nevertheless, with time, as they promise in the Federal Service of Immigration, the examinations will become obligatory for all the immigrants.
In addition, it will not be sufficient with rendering the examination of the language, but also the one of Russian history and the one of foundations of the legislation.
The knowledge of the language will be due to confirm to receive and even to renew the work permission.
The citizens of the countries are exception where the Russian is the official language.
The people will not be subject to this law who managed to obtain their certificates of education and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Utility, fatality and defense of the rights
The network of examining centers will work supported by the Institute of Russian Language Pushkin, the University of the Friendship of the Towns, the State University of Moscow, the State University of Saint Petersburg and other institutions of Russian education superior.
The immigrants will be able to appear to the tests in all the cities, right now in Russia are open more than 160 centers of this type.
The initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by the deputies of Duma Estatal and the Federal Service of Immigration.
But the defenders of the rights, long before which the law entered in force, often managed to make this question to the press: And what will contribute this in fact?
What changes will bring the obligatory nature of the knowledge of the language, as much for the Russians as for the own immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the Service of Immigration respond, this will allow to reduce the number of people who undergo “labor slavery”.
Much people speak today on the defense of the rights of the labor immigrants, explain Víctor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Federal Service of Immigration of Russia in Tajikistan.
The defense of its rights must begin before its game.
Only a system of organized selection will allow to solve the problem of the working immigrants in a 90% of the cases.
The problems have them the immigrants without profession, education, those that do not know the language nor pass the medical checkup.
Without the understanding of the language, he affirms Sebelev, the future immigrant will see the condemned find people without scruples that, with the pretext to help, put a “viajecito to him paid” to a horrifying one and narrows covacha, where he and dozens of others as it is consumed during months without food nor documents, working of 12 to 14 hours to the day.
We receive an endless number of complaints of our immigrants.
“In his mother country they promise a thing to them, but when arriving they are deceived, is deprived to them of its passports, do not pay the promised wages to them”, confirms the Head of the Direction of labor immigration of the Service of immigration of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
One does not get angry, jefecito!
Nevertheless, meanwhile many citizens of the republics of Central Asia that wish to work in Russia recognize that not only they do not know the language from the country to which they try to go, but also that in his own language write with difficulty.
By all means, this is not as much its fault but its own misfortune: the turkmenos, Uzbeks, Tadjiks are few that can occur the luxury to receive normal primary education.
This is due to that their families do not even have anything to give to eat the children, not to mention dressing them, wearing them and to buy the necessary thing to them for the school.
When arriving at the adolescence, these boys venture themselves to work to the first opportunity.
It is difficult, if the language is not known, recognize they.
“One feels humiliated and inferior”.
Nevertheless, concerning the law on the language, the defenders of the rights indicate an important point.
The examinations will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be nor no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the working immigrants illegally continues living in Russia.
“Welcomes or no entry to strangers”
Many visitors affirm that to receive the official status in our country it is not so easy.
The cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language in himself.
In addition, the legalization costs money: of twelve thousands to sixteen thousand roubles.
Nevertheless, a false inscription can be done quickly and by only thousand five hundred roubles.
The employees of the Russian police know that generally we documented false, we are not enrolled and appear the cases of extortion.
“They request one hundred or two hundred roubles to Us for cigarettes or tea”, commented to the journalists the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov.
“We go, you are not stingy, buys a painting”
The first day of the entrance in force of the law on the language, was shown that not only the documents of registry of immigrants can be false.
Several “false” certificates of knowledge of the language already have been seized by civil servants of the Federal Service of Immigration.
The falsified documents had been printed in color printers standard.
By all means, they arrived at the hands of the new proprietors not like gift: each immigrant, being wanted to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid by the document seven thousand roubles.
This is twice and half more expensive than the official procedure of examination, that will cost to the working immigrant three thousand roubles.
The main task for a next future is to protect the system against the corruption so that the “diplomas” cannot be bought, converge the civil servants of the government and the defenders of the rights.
Until the moment, the authorities can promise to the working immigrants who had not been able to pass the examination successfully the first time more time to study the basic course of the language.
In addition, to the immigrants who do not speak Russian they will offer works to them that do not require active communication with the people.
The Department of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal commerce from weapons
The percentage of crimes committed with registered arms enough is reduced
The Department of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to the proprietors of arms of civil use.
This is the reaction of the government before the recent incidents: To tighten firings during celebrations of weddings in which luckily there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by the Muscovite lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in whom To tighten seven people they were killed.
The police wants to prohibit the use and the possession of traumatic arms in places public and to lift the minimum age for the obtaining of license to carry arms, of 18 years to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the female leader of the committee of the Duma in the matter of security and fights against the corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms in the law on the possession arms will be taken to the Duma of in the future next State.
All do not feel like contentments with the fact that the Russian officials are dealing to resist this problem applying the “policy of firm hand”.
In the network it has appeared a opened letter, whose authors, representatives of diverse social organizations of gunners, demand that she is stopped of such measures of “rigor without sense”.
The percentage of acts of vandalism with use of registered arms is minimum, commented to the service of the news BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION of Russia, the lawyer criminologist Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to statistics of the Department of the Interior, during six months of year 2012 142 crimes with use of registered firearms in organs of the Interior were committed, against the total of 1168 crimes registered for this same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that a stricter legislation in the sector of arms of civil use it will not be a disadvantage so that the delinquent goes to the black market.
Now, according to its words, in Moscow any weapon can be found at a low price.
Meanwhile, in the Department of the Interior one affirms that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officials
The black market of arms is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says distant colonel Víctor Baranets, who during ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the General staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts orders of arms
First, “vestige of I exercise or to militate”, that is to say, the arms that were robbed during the military actions in the Caucasus.
“The arms were stolen by the Russian officials and the same caucasians”, says Baranets.
The following type of “black weapon”, robbed by delinquents and the representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that here the stolen arms of the warehouses of the police are included and those robbed directly by civil servants of the organs of fulfillment of the law.
The illegal weapons leave on sale from the military arsenals.
In many military arsenals often there were explosions.
“Demonstrated versions Exist that some fires were brought about very premeditadedly to cover the lack”, comments a former military.
According to Baranets, the manufacturers of arms also put their sand granite.
“Now private factories of arms have proliferated that are not competitive in the international market and distribute arms under cord to the black market, including the one of Moscow”, says the expert.
A source of the black market is the contraband.
Great amount of pistols and machine guns comes from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
“There they count on his own production, sometimes artisan, and a Mafia has formed that has organized the flow of arms”, the ex- military man explains.
From where the arms come?
The experts have calculated which is the participation approximated of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this subject was elaborated in 2011 by the Center of and problem analysis planning of the public management.
The specialists analyzed information of the Department of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and data of public access of portals whose thematic tour around the arms.
The great majority of the illegal weapons, according to the investigators, comes from the Armed Forces and the forces of security.
Half of the arms of the black market has arrived “because of civil servants whose work is related to the arms”, is said there in the report.
According to the investigators, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases rob during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to “illegal archaeology”.
Employee of one of stores of weapons, that asked that its last name was not mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators nobody for long time buys them already because they are too old.
More often, it says, the suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a game.
Through some lieutenant, the supplier buys a unit, for example a pistol TT.
They eliminate it of the registry and they pass it over the fence.
“This one takes the weapon to the city and it sells it to 900 Euros by unit with two shippers”, tells us
“But, clearly, the police this abreast of all the subjects, so periodically, when there is to fulfill the plan of discovery of crimes, they realise purchases of test to the retailers of illegal weapons”, adds the employee.
“Like in a luxury boutique”
The salesman and the buyer usually are through well-known.
“I visited webpages and blogs until a type who proposed me that it go to the platform “Begovaya”, where he would be a man who would take me to a “esquinita” where we could negotiate.
The price of the weapon only there, I found out”.
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
“To obtain a weapon I need a friend who has contacts”, the employee of the store says. “I have a friend thus, but I do not trust much him”.
In the markets there are salesmen, but also it must there arrive, we say “from Mr. Ivanovih, who asked that he said to him that him a tooth to its daughter had fallen”.
I even can secure a pair of steel oven gloves through a confidence person.
It also provides them to me only because he knows that I am not going to expose to him.
The novices look for arms of different ways.
Ex- military man Viktor Baranets put himself on approval in the paper of buyer of illegal weapons in the middle of years 1990, when she get ready to publish an article on this subject.
The schemes, according to their words, have not changed.
They gave an album to him of photos where it did not have “of everything”.
“I felt like in a luxury boutique”, remembers the military man.
To the buyer, according to words of Baranets, they do not offer cat to him by hare: everything what there is can be tried.
I, like potential client, not only buy; we go with the salesman to the forest, where we put a target.
“They give the opportunity to shoot Me and when I make sure that well the weapon shoots, we began to negotiate”, describes to the procedure the expert.
Store of sofas
The web search engines Web lead to sites and groups of “Vkontakte”, where it is offered to buy arms “for different intentions”.
For this one does not require any document nor personal encounter.
“It is sufficient to have a certain amount of money”, they write in the title of the advertising warning “To buy a pistol or a machine gun”.
There the users make their orders and put questions.
And they sell to juniors?
“Without permission, by all means”, asks the user “Iván” (conserved spelling).
“I buy pistol TT. Moscow”, very laconically formulates its question “Fedorenkov”.
The Federal Service of Security has created an enormous network of fictitious websites and captures two hands to which wishes to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish towards the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
military commentator and Viktor Baranets former military
I have heard speak of these systems: generally, the website is registered outside the reach of the Russian laws.
People make the orders.
The buyer realises the payment through an automatic teller.
“In answer, they send a photo and the instructions to him so that it knows where the weapon is hidden”, the right to the arms relates the press secretary of the NGO “”, Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets affirms that if an order is made in line, one remains without weapon and they put it in the jail.
The Federal Service of Security has created an enormous network of fictitious websites and captures two hands to which wishes to buy firearms.
“And people go, like hungry fish towards the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia”, affirms he.
Makarov percent dollars
In the purchase of illegal fire weapons, according to the experts, one can be spent of 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO “the right to the arms”, a Makarov pistol can be acquired by ciento-300 dollars.
A month and a half will be due to hope.
It is sent from the military warehouses by the heads of average rank.
In agreement with the official statistics of the ministry, in comparison with the January-October period of 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia was reduced in a 7%, which constitutes 22,900, and the number of identified cases of robbery and extortion of arms, the explosive ammunition, explosives and devices fell in a 7.8%.
The employees of restaurants of fast food and supermarkets in EE.UU. put themselves in strike
Until a quarter of American adolescents they find his first works like tellers in “McDonald's”
In the last days, in the United States a wave of protests against the low wages has begun that are pleased in the supermarkets of the Walmart corporation and in restaurants of the popular chains of fast food, such as “McDonald's”, “Burger King”, “Taco Bell”, “Wendy's” and “Kentucky Fried Chicken”.
So far nobody dares to assert if this wave will arrive or not at the nine points, or if it must destined lose forces and be tamed in his first stages.
The protest actions count on the support of the unions and a series of NGO of lefts.
Besides the increase of the modest wages received by the workers of Walmart and those of the fast system of food, the objective of the organizers of the protests is the creation of unions of workers in these companies.
So far, this sector of the economy has practically not been occupied by the union movement.
Forty six cents to the year?
The actions began the week last, after the Thanksgiving day, the call “Black Friday”. That day, in the United States coomenzaba the orgy of reductions that it captured million inhabitants, and that sometimes were accompanied of confrontations.
That day, some workers of the Walmart corporation, that it uses to 2.2 million people in the world, they left his jobs and they formed poles of protest next to the unions and activists of lefts in the stores of the corporation, whose products go to people of modest and moderate income.
Walmart sells of everything, from diapers, rifles of hunting and batteries for cars, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are of average between a 8% and a 27% cheaper than those of the greatest supermarkets.
He is why many workers badly paid of Walmart buy only in the work.
The product availability and assortment have done of Walmart one of the greatest corporations of America.
According to the words two critics, Walmart can allow the luxury to sell products to very low price, partly because it pays to his workers little.
These last ones also complain the bad labor conditions, such as the lack of freight elevator or escáneres of hand.
That “Black Friday” the participants of the manifestation demanded the increase of wages and they complained which the cost of the insurance of health provided by the corporation happened of 30 to 100 dollars monthly.
For a typical worker of Walmart, that receives 9.5 dollars per hour, this cost is excessive, said.
Scientists of the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average wage up to 12$ per hour, this will cost to the corporation 3.2 trillions to him of dollars.
This is approximately a 1.1% more than it spends now in wages.
If Walmart places the wage increase in shoulders of the consumers, each visit to the store will be only 46 cents to them more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of 12.39 dollars more than they spend now.
Those in favor of Walmart comment satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and that it did not inflict casualties any to the corporation.
“Black Friday” extended in their stores from the 8 of afternoon of Thursday to the midnight of the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold around 5000 articles per second.
Altogether, their recording boxes realised “Black Friday” almost 100 million transactions.
The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, declared in an interview to the website of Huffington lefts Post, that less than left to their job “five” employees of Walmart and that the protest not had been more than “another trick of public relations”, organized by the union of workers.
“Free box”
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the objectives were not indeed department store Walmart (that in this progressive city does not have esteem to them, and for that reason so far there is no), but “McDonald's” and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that it sells thousands of million portions, and soon not even they grant the sick leave to you and they do not pay you by your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the Municipal Council of New York
At the moment, in agreement with the federal law and the one of New York, the minimum wage is of 7.25$ per hour.
The restaurants of fast food are it increasing with time, but only slightly, and from average, the ordinary workers receive in New York 8.90 dollars per hour.
Nobody desire less than they in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money, for me he is something incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost the quarter of the American adolescents happened through McDonald's and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after the school, although still they lived with his parents.
Few were those that saw this as the main source of income or glided to remain long time there.
Now, constantly slip in some interviews with workers of McDonald's who complain which they must live on this wage, and sometimes to even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal magazine there is a commentary whose author indicates that he is irresponsible to have children if she does not know with what giving them to eat.
The participants in the protests, that Street and Madison Avenue in the morning began to the 6:30 of Thursday in the McDonald's of 40th, demanded that the tellers and cooks of fast food she begins to at least pay 15$ to them per hour, that is to say, that duplicates its present minimum wage to them.
Also they demanded that in the sector of the fast food unions of workers are created.
The law of the EE.UU prohibits the administration to prevent this right them and to punish to the activists of the union movement with hairs-splitting and dismissals.
On the other hand, rarely the administration facilitates the life to them.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy that the unions include the food sector rápid.
One of the main ones is the excessive rotation of the personnel.
Discordant
Noisy protests took place that same day in other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the meeting in McDonald's located near Times Square, in that participated several local politicians democratic, in particular the member of the Municipal Council of the city Jumaane Williams, that said: “McDonald's says that it is selling thousands of million portions, and soon not even gives a hospital you nor pays you by your honest work”.
The demonstrators received the support of other democratic outstanding of New York, for example of the candidate to mayor of the Bill de Blasio city, that said that “we must support the workers of the fast sector of food so that they manage to receive right wages and the economic prosperity that deserves each New Yorker”.
As the New York Times newspaper described it, this has been the greater manifestation of this type in the American history of the fast food.
But in her hundreds of people participated just a few, all of them were not even used of the fast service of food, in which tens of thousands of people of New York trabakan.
Not yet it is clear if this will serve as spark to bring about a massive movement.
“So far, to deceive the brain it is not so easy”
The subject of the increased reality, so popular enters the fans the modern technologies, lately is perceived with normality mainly through prism of special glasses.
At beginnings of the summer, in its annual conference Google it demonstrated a model in movement and later, in November, one knew that Microsoft had also presented a request to demand the corresponding patent.
Nevertheless, of a conversation with the head of the group of interactive technology 3D in the laboratory of Microsoft of Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, was explained that for the scientists of this company, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
Them it attracts the perspective to them of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with the naked hands and the creation of opened virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, which is the object of study of its group of investigation?
- We dedicated to the interaction person-computer, but in addition we tried to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far the humanity in its great mass has been catched in the stage of work with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes the headress with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and to guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors represent a step forward and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since to all it interests the control to them in gestures.
- What provides to us more the future?
- Although Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, great part of this one still happens in a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The information introduction has improved (the system receives more data), and the exit still is not very good.
We are trying to change this, we worked in truly three-dimensional systems of visualization, based on different technologies, including those of design.
The world of computer science is due to release ours, to the physicist, to do it more tangible.
For this, nevertheless, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds it.
Then we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects of a more comfortable form.
First of all, to the devil with those idiot helmets of virtual reality!
- What you think on the control by voice?
A very popular detail, but it doesn't think that they overestimate it?
- Clear that him a panacea cannot be considered, it is pending to solve the privacy question, since not always it is wanted that the others find out our actions and intentions.
In fact, all the types of interaction with computers are good, but each in their own field.
For example, for the control of devices in places public, we had a project in which we thought about the gestures, but not in movements loose, but shorter.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that the movement of the bones and muscles registered.
So far he is very great, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, generally, the future it is for a combined type of control, for example of gesture + voice.
- How he is that?
- For example, how request would you to me who passed this tin to him of soda water?
You will speak and she will show it at the same time.
- Normally I only speak.
- Oh, that is going to be very difficult to recognize.
- That is, do you want to force the users to adapt to which she can or she cannot make the machine at this moment?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual approach.
I believe that in the future next we are going to have to work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, sensors laser, since they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we spoke of his work with the sensors of Xbox Kinect, what complaints you of the modern cameras have?
Do they need resolution, depth or something more?
- In principle, the present generation is what can be the beginning of our work with the three-dimensional recognition.
By all means, megapíxeles at the speed of 1000 would be good for obtaining 8 fps.
But the question is not in megapíxeles, but in the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From this last point of view, all the present technologies are not sufficiently good for us; this employs more to the designers of algorithms.
That is, that we must remember not only the resolution in x-axis and, but also in Z.
Also the speed, the number of pictures per second is important.
30 the human movements are quite dynamic and the present ones of fps are truly little, mainly for the gestures.
Steven Bathiche, of our laboratory in Redmond, made a sensor of contact with adjustable retardation of processing from 1 to 100 ms and is possible to mention that the modern produced sensors in series are more near the second value (60-100).
Everybody does not understand to what extent this affects to the man-machine interaction.
an equivalent of such device would be to me very useful for my work, but that it does not require contact so that the pictures per second are more.
- And it isn't necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three “cameras”, one of which is in fact the infrared ray emitter and the second receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is in fact a simple sensor of the visible tuning fork.
This one is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more amount of cameras could solve the problem…
Or on the contrary, to increase it and to increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good for creating a flexible analog of Kinect, for playing with the curvature of location of the cameras and for seeing how this would help determinr the three-dimensional position.
- Reason why I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented his glasses to the public.
It doesn't seem to him that, from the point of view of the daily use of technologies of increased reality, the glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- By all means, to spend all the short while maintaining in stop an intelligent telephone in the hands, is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased reality “transmutable” when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you you could happen of the glasses to the intelligent telephone,
The glasses are very personal devices, in that is their force (the private things only you will be able to see them), but also their weakness: an increased reality cradle in glasses will not allow him to work on virtual objects along with other people.
- Imaginémonos for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film “Iron Man”, but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that the critics usually indicate: there is no tactile answer!
The hands do not feel anything!
What answers prepare their group for this challenge?
- In my conferences often I say that the increased reality is the seventh irruption in the interaction between the man and the machine.
I believe that the eighth good could be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as support for the image.
It registers the tact perfectly!
But technologies also exist that truly are oriented to contribute tangibility to these “images in the air”. For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where is the finger gives a sensation similar to which one feels if somebody were blowing to him in the yolks of the fingers, but that sensation still is very weak.
There are also bracelets for the wrist that influence in the nervous completions of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- It has tried to deceive the brain?
To make him think that it feels what it seems that would have to feel at the moment at which it sees something?
- That is a good idea, we have still not tried it.
Here another challenge hides with which we will have to fight during long time, how to do that a person physically located in a space very reduced believes that goes to a opened space, almost endless. We are also working in the idea of tapes to run (not like those of the gymnasiums), movable platforms, as well as the one of giant globes.
So far, to deceive the brain is not so easy, still is necessary to work during many years.
That is what the work with the virtual reality for the investigators does attractive, who many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
“Rosbalt” continues the project “Avant-garde of Saint Petersburg”, dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, to the vanguard of the art and the culture.
In this list of the best ones are brilliants figures of the art and the scene of Saint Petersburg, whose profits arrive beyond the city: often they find recognition in Europe without Russia knows them at least.
The new hero of “Rosbalt” is the outlandish artist Kirill Miller.
All the city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed red from top to bottom, to whom it is possible to be found near the Russian Museum, the Garden of fashionable Summer or in meetings and inaugurations.
The pictures of Kirill Miller always attract multitudes, where it wants that they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociofilósofos confidence tricksters of Saint Petersburg, creators of the new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a representing brilliant of the avant-garde of Saint Petersburg of end of the 80 - principles of the 90.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the wide-awake city in the inhabitants smiles and rises all to the mood.
Recently, it took in its hands a barrel organ and one became the organillero of Saint Petersburg, since it has matured to play so difficult role, by its Bohemian existence, its philosophy and its image.
- Kirill, why you go by the city dressed of red and not turkish yellow or, for example?
- I chose the red color because I am fashionable designer and dedicate myself to the appearance and the image.
In this world, the red color is a commitment between the artist, the creators of images and the society.
Although in the society, everything what it is not a little gray provokes aggressiveness and agitation of not at all good properties.
But my provocations are directed to that a conversation begins.
All the history of my provocation is an invitation to the debate.
- When you understood that you had to be artist?
- In a exhibition of the Palace of Nevsky Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized of which that was my way.
Then the big wave of old artists officials had not finished, and new, the free ones like I, was still misunderstood.
I became friend of artists of the new wave, with the later ones to which they were exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, that took “to Pushkinskaya-10”, and the new wave already finished.
I sank in the theater by the clothes, the music of all the sorts, but not by the letters.
- And all this was joined in your Clinic of art… - For me it was important to find me in center cultural of Saint Petersburg, where the best creative minds were due to reunite.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, a musical artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the bohemianism of Saint Petersburg existed.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, memory the way in which Schnur brought to the project to “the ear of Van Gogh”.
Schnur and its friendly sang slight songs under fonograma, dressed fit trousers, among them was at the moment the fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began to touch live, it became “Leningrad”.
Trachtenberg was entertainer of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave Trachtenberg and was the beginning of its great race; the basic education and formation received it from us.
Gallery “D 137”, the “Griboyedov Club, are the rest of the Clinic of the Art.
There our assiduous employees and clients went.
I am a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the survey became in the press, the prize was “the people of our city”.
In the nomination “Artist of the Year” I was chosen, I took root finished my culmination.
In these new times he is not comfortable to work; I am a man to whom it likes the truth, the honesty and the culture of the past century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity go separated. One can be popular but very little cultured.
- It has in your works somewhat recognizable.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them the present time and the occurrence are expressed clearly.
I am going to make a programmed exhibition, “the Russian Museum in clowns”.
The clowns are a eternal category.
I before was sociable, but now to be thus is painful and frightful.
But in the clowns everything is smeared and the tragedy is eliminated.
The grotesque thing enchants to me, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world by means of a totalitarian and obligatory change of clothes.
Now one they follow it by the clothes, orienting itself in the external thing, but not inside the person.
And, perhaps to that person one is not due nor to give the hand him, but to spit to him in the face.
And the deceit will be eliminated when it changes of clothes.
- Recently we saw you in the paper of urban organillero. - A cultured city must have a hero thus.
The who best one than I for being it!
- Well but, perhaps can the commercial art be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, have tact.
We are being witnesses of the disintegration of the cultures.
Before people grouped themselves in herds, the Bohemians wanted a thing, the nincompoops another.
Now all have been divided in microcommunities, is difficult to please to all.
They To all are not a bill of one hundred dollars to like.
Now it is necessary to think to whom you want to like.
Now, each hero of cult has his 100 fans.
- And to listen Stas Mikhailov they arrive by thousands!
- They are going to see the left ones it, works the sex-social sphere there.
And to a cultural event 300 people go, 10 thousands never will come. Like result, less management, less money, everything fades.
I have to my fans, most important is not to deceive them, not to throw to lose what you have obtained.
When a hung collector was young made such pictures that the tapeworm in the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I began with paintings, with which generally people finish.
Now often they confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
Any culture in the consumption does not exist, that is another history.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, grew under the example of artists who lived in the poverty and died in the poverty, refused to the money to only paint pictures.
I am in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what is what it needs to Saint Petersburg?
- Good experts in culture.
A concept exists: civil servant of the culture.
But all of them cannot be dedicated to the culture.
When the correct kings were the everything was of another way, perhaps the kings did not understand very well the culture, but they knew that it was necessary to maintain the correct experts.
In Moscow now there are very good consultants.
We have people in Saint Petersburg that could well be expert, but are closed, because experts at a level are needed superior who evaluate correctly to these and they lay way to them.
Now it is prospering the subjective personal taste.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they say honestly that all the modern art is not accepted, are some artists whom they must look for other museums.
- What is for you Saint Petersburg?
- Saint Petersburg is not one cultural capital. In Moscow more culture is much, is land there.
But on our stones it is difficult that the art grows.
We need cultural land and we have more writers now than readers, this is bad.
In Europe there is a pile of people with curiosity that goes to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is very small.
We must cause that the art is fashionable, as were it at the beginning of the past century.
The project will be executed with a subsidy of Saint Petersburg.
To give to light in the space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or shock with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board start off in search of a spare part planet.
In order to conserve the humanity the main question is made: How to continue the species in conditionses of weightlessness or the same planet of spare part?
I believe that there is little where to choose.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetical.
“These are Venus and Mars”, says the investigating head of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But the Mars conditions are better for the life, in the surface of Venus the temperature is of 500 degrees.
It is only possible to be lived to great altitudes or in the orbit of Venus… in the space.
It was begun to approach the problems of reproduction in the space with the flora.
Already half a century ago carried out experiments with plants.
Four generations of peas worked in orbit were not different in anything from the terrestrial varieties.
Later the young from insects in the orbit, small flies of the fruit, drosófilas came.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent to the space to verify how the embryo in conditionses of weightlessness is developed.
We obtain like result a normal chick.
But soon the problems begin.
“The problem is in which this chick must find support, must stay on its own feet and begin to move”, Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Problemas Biomédicos (IPBM) of the Academy of Sciences of Russia explains.
When not finding support, the chicks gave somersaults at random.
And after 10 new born hours in a total atrophy of the instincts occurred.
The chicks did not react to the light nor to the sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days simply they died.
“And twice we obtained that the chicks were born, but soon we left it because it was impossible to work there with them”, comments Vladimir Sychev on failure of the experiment with the chicks in the space.
The last time that a “biological minicoffer” flew to the orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of the 2013 they will continue the experiments.
Nevertheless, in the biosatellite “Bion” species of the same sex will only travel.
There was an experiment with rats, that were sent to the space already with fetuses.
In principle, was nothing supernatural.
“This was indeed in the biosatellites, but this it was a unique experiment, and studies as this they must carry out itself”, Vladimir Sychev comments.
After the landing, the space rats had descendants.
Nevertheless, one has still not been able to directly approach the problem of the reproduction in the space.
It is a difficult challenge.
The animal, when losing their habitual habitat, simply cannot realise their sexual instinct.
The man, nevertheless, unlike the small animal, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has the abstract reasoning and is able to create a suitable emotional bottom.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But the women travel already to the space for 50 years.
The greater risk passed it Tereshkova.
And the most appraised than it has the humanity is the feminine organism.
Our gull flying, and nobody in the Earth could say: if it is after a flight to the space.
It will be able or not to have a baby after this flight.
“After all, to this question nobody has responded”, comments the veteran of the aerospace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June of 1964, only after a year of the flight to the space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave to light a daughter.
The father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and he even worked in the opened space, had a son.
Nevertheless, the risk persists.
We are few, are counted the astronauts to those who after long flights everything has been to them well, and a healthy generation comes growing.
“And if more can be said, is dangerous even in orbital flights”, summarizes the pilot cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
Nevertheless, the humanity must look for some new routes in the biotechnology, in the radiological safety, the creation of the artificial gravity.
Hidrolaboratorio of the Center of preparation of cosmonauts is an obligatory stage in the preparation for the flight.
In conditions of null bouyancy, the cosmonauts practice their abilities of work in the space.
The water simulates the weightlessness.
If for an adult the water is comfortable surroundings, although still hostile, for a boy new born it is its native element.
Small the man-amphibian seems to confirm that the Earth life arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby one is approximately 9 months within its mother in amniotic fluid, because it will be easier to him to be accustomed soon to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of the birth to the moment of the first bath they spend only 2 weeks.
“This is very little for forgetting something”, says Marina Aksenova, monitor of swimming of new born.
In summary, if the weightlessness is a more natural state for new born, for the women it is necessary the gravitation, the force of the gravity.
In the weightlessness the abdominal muscles and of the pelvis are decrepitan very fast, the capacity of expulsion of the fetus is reduced.
Good, we omitted that, trusting the action of stimulating for the childbirth.
It is possible, by all means, to be assumed to light in a special-purpose aerial camera, this one will push it.
“And as soon as? ”, Valeri Polyakov becomes this original question.
On the other hand, the boy also needs artificial gravity.
Without the gravity sensation, the organism does not generate the skeleton nor the muscular system.
To new born in orbit it is impossible to dress it in a special suit for training, like the adults.
Simply it will be deprived to him than he is vital for him.
“And this experiment that we are going to do together, when allowing the birth of a boy in an ambient stranger, will give rise to that we bring to the Earth to a disabled one, to a totally unadapted person”, anticipates the head of the committee of bioethics of the Institute of biomedical problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov.
So far, the birth of children in the space is a theoretical question.
Nevertheless, with time this will be a reality, when the human beings in their ships go to a distant planet that will be the home for its children born in the space.
Head of NKÚ: The inspection of the system “švarc” has not given with the guilty politician
In the matter of public awardings, the Czech Republic counts on good inspectors and a legislation of quality, although its application limps.
Thus Miloslav Kala affirms it, vice-president of the Office of Control Suprema (NKÚ) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
“The law never will be perfect”, but its application must be correct. “That is to say, in my opinion, which we need”, thus it describes the present situation.
The joint controls of the Czech inspectors and German also reach similar conclusions.
Like example of an incorrect practice, čas mentions the attitude of Petr Ne towards the system of being independent only on the paper, that knows like the system “švarc”.
Prime minister said recently that ODS (Partido Democrático Cívico) would not bother to the businessmen with inspectors. Then, he is prohibited or he allowed?
“The law must be regulated of some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, nor the president of the government it can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out these controls nor to demand obligations”, Kala states.
In the meeting of the commission of control in the Congress of the Deputies, You spoke of the common project between the Czech equipment and the German, within the framework of who the legislation referring to the public awardings in both countries was compared.
What is exactly?
One is a parallel control that we began to realise about ago two years.
Said of simplified way: the European legislation it regularizes how the public awardings are due to organize, to this follows the effective legislation to him in each country and, later, the praxis in himself.
We have united it everything and, although the control not yet has finalized, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country she is “stricter and more complete”, nevertheless, the concrete praxis in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is confirmed, then, that is not enough with incorporating more and more strict rules, but is necessary to concentrate itself in the application of the same law.
What can contribute in fact this project? Which think that they are the conclusions?
Indeed a common control of this type could contribute to that we stopped investing efforts in the concretion of the laws, the reduction and the improvement of the limits, although this does not have a so positive impact.
The economy of the saving means to secure an suitable thing to a reasonable price (what not always it means that the price is lowest) to avoid therefore the criminal enrichment and, in the long run, actions.
But not due to reducing the limit of the awardings it means that we are going to obtain it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with as much “red tape”, that those that want to look for failures in the system will be able to do it more easily that if the limits stayed as high as now.
You speak of the problems of our country with the transference of the legislation that regulates prácticaa of the public awardings.
How work does the control system in Germany?
It is an office similar to our NKÚ or it is organized of another way?
As far as the offices, like the NKÚ, the only thing acts there the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a school also, is that if so it is structured of a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
Also the competitions are until certain point similar, nevertheless, whereas Germany has a federal organization, the National Audit Offices even are at this level. In this aspect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Cuentas (BRH) only can control the federal money, which we called state bottoms here.
The bottoms public, who are administered by the regions and the municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled in the Federal Court of Accounts.
As far as the local legislation, she is simpler than ours?
Generally, I would not like to establish a comparison without concrete data. However, Germany continues being a model in some aspects, but it is not possible to be needed with exactitude in what it is better.
It could be better, for example, as far as the quality of the inspectors?
That certainly no, but, I repeat, does not like to make this type of comparisons.
It is necessary to even say that those countries that we took as model must do in front of a great number of problems.
If not outside thus, it would not suppose any benefit to them to collaborate with our office, it doesn't create?
As far as the legislation of our country, what meant for their Office the law amendment on the public awardings? Pronounced of some way its is incidence?
Considering that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, not yet it has been pronounced in the control activities.
Since we carried out controls ex post, it is precise to count on a certain delay.
So far, it is observed in the process of preparation of the future controls: we have initiated a new tool of “detection of noneconomic risks”, through which we have made pass almost 14,000 public awardings, that have been analyzed. The changes will be seen perfectly reflected here, since the limits modify, rectify the conditions of some types of the process of selection and similar.
It considers that the approval of this law is beneficial or that, rather, supposes a confusion for the bureaucratic system?
I believe that this law is surely a step in the right direction and hope that thus it is.
The problem that can arise is that the norm “becomes hardened” and that it is impossible to fulfill it.
Already with the previous norm, the controlled people were tie to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operative programs of the regional advice), and each law respected in the matter of public awardings did not mean the violation of the budgetary discipline.
It has sense then to harden the law this way?
I believe that not this way.
The system must exclude which wants to attack it or to take advantage him and not punish to that they commit a formal failure, that does not have incidence in the decision making.
A system of this type will only be able to create a greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how one leaves this?
We will see towards where it takes this initiated way to us.
Prime minister has declared recently who the ODS would not bother to the businessmen with controls of the call system švarc, in reference to the fact of being independent only on the paper. What means this?
Is the system švarc” prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated of some way and, if it prohibits something, then not even prime minister of the government can prevent the action of the Office that has the obligation to carry out these controls and to demand obligations.
It can say: “We changed the law and we allowed it”, but it cannot say that we will do as if nothing.
In the law on the public awardings, the norm is quite strict as far as the way in which it is due to act formally. And thus it is as it must be to protect the public competition.
But, on the other hand, he is tragic that is excluded the candidate with the best supply not to fulfill the formal exigencies.
The law never will be perfect, but its application must be correct. That is to say, in my opinion, which we need.
The highways present icy patches, although in its majority they are passable
In several places of the Czech Republic the highways present snow and icy patches.
Although the majority of the routes is passable, in some must carry far the precaution.
Region of Karlovy Vary
Today in the morning the highways in the region of Karlovy Vary were passable, but they presented snow and icy patches.
The temperature descends and will oscillate below cero between five and ten degrees. During the day the thermometers will raise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low zones the snow layer is fine.
However, in the crests of Metallic Montes the snow reaches the 30 centimeters almost.
In some places the visibility was still bad because of the fog, according to the information of the control center of operations of the highways of the region.
The fast route R6 and the highway of first category in the region are now passable without restrictions.
Nevertheless, it is recommended to carry far the precaution, mainly in some bridges whose surface can be frost and to be slippery.
Also, also all the routes of second and third category are passable, including the mountain highways.
However, in some of them still there are sections with rest of ice and tamped snow.
It is precise to increase the attention in the highway, mainly in the lifted zones more.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
In some highways of Eastern Bohemianism there is a danger of frosts and in lifted zones more and mountains it can have formed a snow layer in the routes, informs in his pages the Direction into highways and freeways.
The workers of highways warn more to the conductive ones on the danger that form icy patches, especially in lifted zones of the region of Pardubice.
They can take place frozen in the environs of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and mainly in the highways of second and third category.
The I/43 highways and I/34 in Svitav have been treated chemically.
Hory is snow especially in the highways of mountains of Krkonoše to Orlické.
Nad Kněžnou and Trutnov is a snow layer tamped in the highest zones of the highways in the municipalities of Rychnov.
In the zone of the Eastern Bohemianism, the sky today between will be cleared and partially storm cloud, without precipitations.
The temperatures will oscillate generally between below cero three and a positive degree, will blow a weak wind.
Region of Pilsen
The highways in the region of Pilsen are passable today in the morning, although the precaution will have to be carried far and will be necessary to adapt to the time.
In the first hours in the morning it will have frozen, the temperatures will oscillate below cero between three and nine degrees.
After the Nevada and of the later reduction of the temperatures, some routes could also be ice covers.
In some places the conductors will be with fog, but the visibility will improve progressively.
This is what it is come off the information of the control center of operations of highways of the region.
The D5 freeway is passable almost without restrictions, although it is recommended to carry far the precaution, mainly in the route between kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of the majority of the highways of first category is dry and without ice.
In the zone of the highway of Pilsen and border Tachov with Germany it can have sections with icy patches.
The routes of second and third category are humid, reason why, in this case, also it is noticed of sections with icy patches.
The conductors would have to be more prudent, especially in the journeyed routes less in the zone of Šumava.
Region of Olomouc
The conductors who go to the highest zones of the region of Olomouc will be partially with snow rejects.
After the chemical treatment, still it was snow in the port of Červenohorské and the route in the direction of Videlský kříž.
The workers of highways cleared the snow during the night; in the highway of Šumper three centimeters of snow were accumulated about, according to the administrators of the routes.
In the rest of the region, the majority of routes is passable without restrictions.
“In the highest zones of the highway of Šumper, they are rest of snow.
The conductors in the port of Červenohorské will be with average snow rejects in the direction of Jeseník”, has confirmed today a worker of the administration of highways of Šumper to the ČTK.
On the land and at night their colleagues went to the Jesenická also and, after the chemical treatment, the tracks of the highest zones now are cleared and dunked.
In the highway of Olomouc the routes are passable without restrictions, in the one of Šternberská the conductors would have to lead with precaution in the forest sections, where the routes continue being humid.
Region of Ústí nad Labem and region of Liberec
The operators of the highways of the north of Bohemianism have informed on complications in different sections first thing in the morning.
Aside from some places in which it has snowed or frozen, according to the data base of the police the mountain highway between Telnice and Knínice in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
The temperatures stay below cero, even in the lowest zones, reason why the ice and the snow obvious remain in the road. However, in the lowest zones, especially in the south-east of the Czech central bulk, there are no problems and the highways, generally, are dry.
By mmento complications have not been registered on watch.
The operators of highways have warned of the ice presence in the neighborhood of Štětí.
According to the meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain is expected and snow that melts and at night the sky will be cleared and will be ice.
From the general highways unfavorable conditions in the I/13 highway have announced, in the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The highway between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had bent on the route with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
One little says that in less than a month is going to arrive the aim from the world, what thinks envelope it?
She is only one among so many other alarmist news to which we like to take hold to us.
To the group of music The APT APT we rather like to make jokes on this and we like to say that we are the only group of music of the world that is able to reunite sufficient positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Be explained can she to our readers?
One is a state act beneficial that we took gliding for two years.
We were decided to take advantage of the potential marketing that in the morning has the end of the enunciated Mayan calendar for the 21 of December to the 11:10.
Previous day, the 20 of December to the 21 hours, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in the Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will finish to the same hour approximately in which the Mayan calendar in the Kiribati island finishes, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours in front of our hour zone.
To whom this idea was happened to him?
Initially it was idea mine, later we were forging the project all together ones with our designer Honza Augusta.
Besides wanting to reunite sufficient positive energy and to avoid the end of the world, also we want to reflect, along with the society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar also we have created a unique article collection: boots, t-shirts, bags and original key rings against the end of the world that can be acquired in www.e-tap.cz, another form to support to us.
The group The APT APT, along with other interpreters, also sang the call hymn against the end of the world, that takes by title “End of the world, cancelled”.
At the moment he is very popular in YouTube, it will be possible to be heard in the beneficial concerts?
Clear that yes, and he will be right last, the good one, whenever everything comes out well and the world does not finish…
All the interpreters in the three concerts will sing it at the same time.
The hymns will connect to each other simultaneously thanks to the special broadcasting in direct in the Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the letter of this song and interprets the protagonist paper of Jesus in video, where also Xindl X sings…
How arise this did collaboration?
We work jointly even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, aside from organizing many beneficial acts and concerts…
We put all our persistence in participating in this project.
One has demonstrated that to the majority of them it interests to them and it amuses to them to work with us.
To what the money collected in the concerts against the end of the world will be destined?
To equipment for the educative center without Studeo barriers, that we upon maturity had been in his sixth consecutive year with civil association APT in Jedličkův ústav.
The students of the school of Jedličkův ústav regularly receive the visit of professors with whom they realise funny and interesting activities.
The students do not have economic means sufficient to pay to the professors and we make efuerzo to do it possible.
Within the framework of the conclusion of works in Jedličkův ústav, will exist an independent building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert several groups and interpreters act.
Which are the selection criteria?
We try to make a program that is attractive for all the generations, including the children.
For example, in the Prague they will act Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The APT APT, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
In order to obtain more detailed data, you can consult www.kpks.cz.
You have predicted some other “similar spectacular action” in the future?
In May we will act for the first time in the Pražské festival jaro, so here surely we will prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year also we would like to touch in the Bohemian National Hall de Nueva York and, personally, being useful that we are in the United States, I she would like to complete it with activities in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not indeed minimalist, until now you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The APT APT is, however, a group formed by people with incapacity.
How she is logistic and the organization of these trips?
It is not so difficult how it can seem at first sight.
There are five members in electrical wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the compartment for luggage and in addition we took much weight, the boxes with the instruments…
Nevertheless, until now we have fixed them to us well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly preparations, something that do not stop surprising to me.
In Moscow, of where we have returned recently, it even left everything without problems.
Thanks to the exits to the foreigner you can compare the different attitudes from the society towards disabled and the other aspects.
With what you have been until now?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything work better than here; in Russia we have been witnesses of which much, in the east, it is way to cross.
Unlike the Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, follows there without being frequent that a person dissatisfies herself single by in an electrical wheelchair.
Something as current as is, for example, to give preference to anybody in wheelchair in elevator, is not it there.
Luckily, a civil association has been created that strives to tematizar the problems of the people with incapacity.
In what aspects we must take example from advanced countries more?
There are many aspects in which we go behind…
But it is important to mention that the improvement and the improvement of the situation always depend on the people to whom affects directly.
In London and Madrid it is very normal that people with a serious incapacity dissatisfy themselves by her account in public and can go to the service, to the museum, where wants…
But it is not very common that a great number of people with incapacity participates actively in the social life, in this aspect, with The APT APT we go a little ahead!
Society respectful or without barriers is thing, but when the moment in that arrives eminent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers arise, will begin to really change everything.
Until now, are isolated cases of people who have a great force of will.
The group The APT APT is at the moment very popular, but we looked at some years back, what took to you to form the group in 1998?
I entered like educator Jedličkův ústav, where it had much young people around that wanted to dedicate itself to something.
And since I am musical, touch, among others, the saxophone, I founded a group amateur with a fellow worker.
And with time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, he was to us a little the hands (laughter).
Nevertheless, the popularity did not arrive until these last years, or equivocal me?
It is truth that helped the fact enough us to connect with famous singers and also to work actively to promote the group.
We reach the conclusion that the work that is not seen, is as if did not exist.
Thanks to the aid of the European Union, we can allow in addition teaching staff us to quality, equipment, etc.
You had intention to arrive so far with The APT APT?
From the beginning I saw the potential that was, that can be done something otherwise.
The world of the spectacle is full of things that are looked some like the other.
It is logical, to his way, all the new one take refuges with caution and takes long time in accepting itself.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare to say that The APT APT is one of them.
The impression of which it sees us for the first time is clearly the compassion, is a natural reaction…
But the compassion is totally superfluous because the people with incapacity are not beings left who suffer and of that we must have compassion.
There is people who are able to live a total life and to be developed, with the condition, by all means, of which she has necessary means.
I always say that if something comes out to them well to people with incapacity, then, it is not only an advance for them, but for all the society.
He helped the fact that You are a demanding head, as she describes much people to him?
If we want to do a work of quality, we must be rigorous in many aspects and to demand certain discipline.
I believe that it is completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with the head in clouds and when they find out that they must go two days to try, to go to the preparatory test and to spend long time being traveled and in concerts, the initial euphoria leaves to them quickly.
But thus it is how it works everywhere, in each group that wants to work and to obtain something.
At the moment the group The APT APT has twenty members.
How many of them they were already in the beginnings of year 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are a opened group, people it enters and it leaves, it is not possible to be avoided.
Who it has will and desire will always find the open doors
It will be the day before the awaited Thursday, world end 20.12.2012 to the 21 hours
It will take place in the Incheba Sand of the Prague, Fléda de Brno and Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate to 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected at the end of the evening through videoconference to jointly sing the song of the group The APT APT “End of the world, cancelled”
The objective of the concert is to reunite the resources necessary to fund multifunctional equipment of the educative center without barriers STUDEO in Jedličkův ústav of the Prague, whose cost ascends to 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and the children up to 12 years free have entrance in the option of sale anticipated in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
In the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency celebrated the past week it was accepted to Poland like twelfth member of THAT. It is the second Member State of THAT of the old block of East Europe, after the Czech Republic, that became total member the 12 of November of 2008).
Poland initiated an intense collaboration with THAT in 1994 and during the later years it participated in the commission of projects of the agency.
Nevertheless, the way of Poland towards the cosmos began long before.
The enthusiastic Poles already dedicated themselves to the flights to the space before World War II, although not always its work was understood.
Memory, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld in the astronomical observatory of Warsaw in which, the 6 of December of 1933, “Introduction to the cosmonautics” presented its ideas on the pioneering study.
The ideas of the young engineer (been born the 1905) left the indifferent assistants and, years later, Šternfeld it remembered that the Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the unique one that had shown interest in their work.
In 1934 Šternfeld obtained in France the prize Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch by its “Introduction to the cosmonautics”.
Doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned previously, later became a great impeller of astronomy and the cosmonautics.
It published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of the cosmonautics, was well-known anywhere in the world and its contribution to science was compensated when its name to one of craters of the dark side of the moon was put.
In year 1925 a dresina was already constructed in Poland that was going to be provided of a motor of rockets.
Lamentably, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and destalles are not known the project either.
It is not clear if the rocket were going to be used for the starting of the dresina or its braking.
The information on this dresina is limited the collection in the press of the time.
As of year 1933 the Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to the missiles.
The investigation was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the conserved material, one becomes evident that the investigation arrived at the stage of the troop trialses.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 it appeared in the specialized press the prototype of a photoelectric missile of hunting designed by Rohoziński engineer and the following year torpeda was published the study “Rakieta - powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza”, of Leliwa-Krzywoblocki author.
Both projects were destined to the military use of the motors for missiles.
Shortly before the war, the provisional scientific advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was in charge of all the projects of techniques of missiles use to militate and coordinated all the works.
The committee was founded on 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to the cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the edition of November of 1954 of the Problemy magazine reference to the society with four very extensive articles dedicated to the astronautics is made for the first time.
In one of them, of Prof. M. Subotowicze, the creation of a society seted out that would dedicate itself to the cosmonautics.
At that time already projects of artificial satellites had started up and was obvious that the cosmic investigation was a discipline with perspective de futuro.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Society of Astronáutica (PTA) aspired to comprise of the Federation the International of Astronautics (founded on 1951) and autumn of that same year the Pta became total member.
The year following the first president of the Pta, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), passed to be vice-president of the Federation Internacional of Astronautics.
It carried out this position until his death in 1959.
As of the 1956, the Pta significantly participated in the development of the sounding rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), that was a success and it became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research took to end.
First type RM-1 was finalized in 1957 and the 10 of October of 1958 were sent for the first time.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and it did not arrive at the 5 kg of weight.
Later, it was finished constructing version RM-1A and in summer of 1959 the aerial tests of rockets RM-2 of two stages in the desert of Błędów began.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket was going to be object of real scientific study. Rocket RM-34 was going to have an apogee of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the height wind.
Nevertheless, in 1962 the works were suspended.
The successor of the first rockets of type RM was the Meteor-1 rocket, that was constructed during years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed like two-stage rocket, with a length overall of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (Meteor-1A calls, -1B and -1C), who were different themselves to each other by the space available for scientific equipment.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was of 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and the Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum apogee in the three types was of 37 km.
Between years 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed in the Aerial Institute, whose first aerial tests began in October of 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to take a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km of height.
Later the version Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 was constructed.
It is necessary to later mention also the entrance of Poland in the COSPAR (for Committee Space Research) in year 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years.
Within the framework of the Interkosmos program, Poland was united to the cosmic space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of the law on social works is not the solution.
The past week social traabajos the constitutional court suspended the law.
The resolution woke up an heated discussion in the society.
Of course he will be interesting to examine problematic the existing one from a ampler point of view.
The liberal economic systems in the EU, just as on the globalized world, are based on the principle of a greater economic and less normative competition.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and the national economic systems are in permanent conflict to each other.
The cause is in the principle of the free trade and the free and limitless movement of private capital, along with the wild financial speculation.
The effect of the great differences in the labor cost (of the wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap merchandise, tries to shorten distances and for it “bajadda” of the price of the competitor with the aim of taking control most of the market causes one and, in this way, to increase its margin of benefits.
On a large scale it means, for the majority of the businessmen, to transfer the production to the foreigner, to buy more cheap or to disappear there. The result is an unemployment elevated in those countries in which the price of the work, in comparison with other economies, is higher.
Because the private capital does not have social responsibility some and, in this way, he is not either responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, necessarily grows the social spending of the state.
All this situation causes the total disinterestedness of the businessmen to pay taxes and to compensate the economic and social damages that have caused in their eagerness to obtain benefits.
The situation is universally so well-known that it is not necessary to present concrete statistical data.
The little scrupulous practices of the private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of reducing artificially the social level of the own population and, in this way, to attract foreign capital the country.
To put it another way, the governments put private capital at the disposal of their own population without considering the social declivity.
This is mainly made patent in the changes of the effective laws.
The objective is to force to the population to that it accepts the dictation of the private capital, mainly with regard to the wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, by means of the system of economic obligation in the case of unemployment long play; on the other, by means of the restricted right of the employees as far as labor rights.
The result is an increasing poverty along with the increase of the differences between rich poor men and.
For a series of years, distributing points of foods for poor people exist in Germany who cannot stay with their own work.
The number of people who receive this type of aid reachs the million already.
Within the framework of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economy, a quite frequent case takes place: people employed with a wage so under that the state must pay the rest to arrive at the minimum essential to survive.
Public became a scandal of this type related to the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament.
The measures of saving of practically all the states of the south of the EU lead, without doubt, to the same situation. The people, pressed by an abysmal declivity of their social level, are forced to emigrate as in century XIX or to malvivir with a terrible wage in the limit of the society, with the hope from which someday she arrives at the deprived investing capital country.
It is necessary to preguntrar itself from where comes?
In case one is other countries of the EU, then the poverty happens from a country to another one or it never arrives, since Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African they continue working by a very small part of an European wage.
This also affects to all Latin America.
The liberal theories and the mass media affirm over and over again that the state would not have to contribute capital to the economy, that to direct the economy leads to its failure.
The private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis of which the state would not have to take part in the economy interfering in the control.
Next, it is necessary to ask itself if the private capital does not influence with its egoism in the political march and, therefore, in all the state.
In this case the answer is clearly affirmative.
The test is the existence of lobbies, very powerful and actually omnipresent, in all the states.
The result is a desperate situation that is pronounced in the scope of the corruption, in the mutual favors, a legislation that is practically reprovable everywhere but he is not punishable.
In Germany the situation is the following one: the state ministries, for want of average financiers, order the writing of projects of law to private legal companies, which are often tie with the industry.
This type of law projects is approved later in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all the power does not emanate of the town, as it announces in the constitutions of the western democracies, but of the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that the democracies with a liberal direction are quickly in a situation how the one that describes to Appiános in its work the crisis of the Roman republic in the days of Caesar and Pompei: “The state had been time disintegrating itself and the administrations took care to the force”.
In exchange for bribes, obtained favors illegally and help to fund stones or swords.
The bribe and the corruption extended without impediment some and people went beforehand to the ballot boxes with the agreed to vote”… “there was no people with character that aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls”… “The only remedy for a so serious situation Began to be spoken in serious of which was the autocracy and that was necessary to choose an energetic man”… Although Appiános thought about Pompei, Caesar raised the power and transformed the democracy for always into autocracy.
The conclusion, in the same way that in the antiquity, it is that the present society is based on desconsideradas preferences of the individual benefit without considering the common interests.
The private capital is not able, in its essence, to understand and to demand the benefits of all the society.
The result is the same that at that time ones, a decay of the elite without precedents, without a effort is realised to reform it in depth.
The causes of the height of the facist and communist regimes must look for, therefore, in the wild liberalization of the economic systems in century XIX and XX.
With respect to the present situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems to the benefit of a democracy of liberal type, as a defined pause, in the hope of the next blow.
The really demolishing fact is that the present elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes of which we have been witnesses, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in the old and most recent history.
The suspension of the law on public awardings is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure of the economic competition, as much international level as within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic one will be forced to continue looking for other routes to reduce the social level of the population.
This tendency is, therefore, systemic.
The solution happens through concrete sociopolitical reforms, that reinforce so much the participation of the State Capital as the influence of the citizens in the government and which they debilitate the position of monopoly of the private capital in the society to the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of the chaos.
“That nothing you eat from violence and nothing to ever could” (nothing arises from the violence and nothing could do it), Sting in its Fragile song and whose refrain says “Let's do not forget how fragile we plows” (we do not forget the fragile thing that we are).
“If my children did not want wars, there would not be any” Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in his I milk of death in 1849.
After the last ones adminisering extreme unction to violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, have arisen, as always, diverse reactions.
One, of the side of Israel, argues in favor of the self-defense right and classifies to the Palestinians in the roll of terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and erases to Israel of terrorist state.
I do not want to concentrate in whom he is guilty of the slaughters that are repeated periodically and who is the victim. After all, the citizens of nowadays of Israel, including the independent territories, were born within the present political situation and the beginnings did not live on the violence.
My intention is to offer to the readers a glance behind the curtain, a glance to discover who extraction benefit of the tensions that crawl for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November of 1917) in a small land surface of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others in conclusions at which I have arrived on the base of my own way to understand the subject, on whom or what group of people is the main impeller of the events of modern history.
In the history of the humanity the history of the fights by the power is in first row.
At every time we can find an Alejandro Magno or a Napoleón.
But what no longer it is so evident it is if those were always these characters that directed their passages of independent way or if behind its throne there was somebody oriented its actions towards a certain objective.
We must accept that we lived at a time that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power that this implies, has not been able to arrive in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families it emphasizes one that could be considered most prominent (if still there is somebody behind, I do not know it, but I do not discard it): the Rothschild.
It is not written much to near them.
Naturally.
In years 90 of century XIX they bought the first agency of the news (Reuters) so that they stopped associating its name with criminal acts of much gravity. The power and the wealth, or both, covered the backs to them, something that always stop they meant a fortification.
They have important participation in almost all the central banks of the world and in those countries in which they are not represented, it has been declared or a war is being prepared: before the attack to Afghanistan they were 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq were 5, after overthrowing to Gadafi were only four, but meanwhile Russia has submitted the central bank to the Russian government.
All that one that has tried to be against to this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the central bank Bank of America of the Rothschild, began during the War of Secession to print money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began to print money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned year 1936 after wanting to demand to the EDF to have triggered the great economic crisis of year 1929.
Its eagerness by the world-wide power took to them during years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the Albert Pike mason, decorated with degree 33.
The first war was marked like objective to eliminate the great monarchic states in all Europe; second it wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially of Great Britain, and third one seted out to reduce the Earth population between means million and billions of people (similar amount of slaves for its well-being and luxury would be enough and they would not consume so many resources), besides the creation of a universal religion (the ecumenicalism is not nothing else that a first draft for similar solution) and the definitive adoption of the absolute powers.
The method with which it operates the group of the richest families, along with the Rothschild, follows the dynamics of the outbreak of crisis and the later offer of a solution (to order ab cao - order from the chaos).
These solutions are, nevertheless, erroneous, and always entail a worsening of the situation. If no, it is enough to remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis like the one of year 1907 was not repeated.
So, after the success of the murder of the heir to the Austrohungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after, as a result of it, World War I was triggered, they destroyed to czarist Russia with the beginning of the revolution Bolshevik.
World War I finished of sudden and unwarranted way from the military and economic capitulation, point of view of Germany (the wars to end czarist Russia were already unnecessary) and later dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austrohungarian empire.
In order to prepare the land of World War II, they allowed that the bankers and politicians created, of way concealed, a conflicting situation as a result of the enormous imposed repairs military on Germany, and so the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses were created. Later, it was enough with serving to them to the Germans the solution to them as the Führer, that was sufficiently strong and simple and indicated to guilty, and later constructing a Czechoslovakia composed by several nationalities with a strong German minority that had to represent and represented the function of the fifth column so well, that caught the flame and brought about the outbreak of the war.
To the end of century XIX, the Rothschild drove the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of the old Judea with Jerusalem like capital (return to the Sion).
Mentioned the Balfour declaration previously established the bases for the massive immigration from Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
Terrorist attacks in both parts took place.
World War II exploded: it is difficult to know if Hitler threw too much of the cord to which they had it at first tied the international bankers or if everything what did comprised of a plan. Nevertheless, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the world-wide society.
Israel was founded officially on 1948 and, similarly to the way in which the imposed repairs military to Germany smoothed the way towards World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the center for one third war was created.
If the international bankers were able to initiate it, the Jewish nation, like World War II, he would become victim in forward edge battle, now along with the Arab population or, generally, Muslim of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a machine of weld and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also on international scale. We take as example how the supporters and detractors of Israel are divided of categorical way.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the conflict Palestinian-Israeli? Where does the injustice generate injustice in a spiral of interminable violence, S.A. beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their eagerness by the world-wide power?
In this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and its agent chief executives, because, like he happens in our country, the international bankers only present to their candidates in the elections.
The present president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of facist, loyal politician to the international bankers, whom the possible one does all to declare the war to Iran and, whereas clause that Iran is member of the Organization of Cooperation of Shanghai (China, India, Russia, Pakistan…), it would threaten in becoming a global conflict and, if we consider that Iran controls the Straits of Ormuz, through where it passes 20% of all the world oil (the navigation runner has only two miles in width), would take to the destruction of the global economy.
Under what light are now the words that David Rockefeller in 1994 pronounced: “The only thing that we needed is a general crisis and people will be in agreement with a new world order.”
The new world order in its imagination is a world of gentlemen and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves to a handful of people who comprise of the financial aristocracy rich good.
A world in which to each new individual a chip when being born is implanted to him that it controls all their being.
“And it forces to all, small and great, rich and poor, free and enslaved, to have a brand in the right hand or the forehead, to not being able to buy nor to sell, unless they take to the name of this monster or the numbers of its name.
It is necessary to understand it: who front has two fingers, that add the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred sixty-six”.
Film Argon: If it is put crude, it calls to Hollywood
In November of 1979 a group of the manifestation of students islamists occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduate ones like hostages.
Its release was going to be in exchange for overthrown shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, which after the revolution fled to EE.UU, country that had sponsored its regime during decades.
For the American administration the situation did not offer any positive perspective: to throw shah by the hut could not be allowed, since, if it did, it put in danger the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had ended at the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not to its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, that later intensified still more with the attempt bankrupt to release to the hostages by the force.
The jailed diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the government of Algeria.
In EE.UU., their destiny it caused to a wave of solidarity and antagonism against Iran.
The failure in Iran decisively contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in front Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections of 1980.
The film “Argon” of the director and tematiza actor Ben Affleck an episode of this history, that reaped a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees of the building escaped.
After a complicated long journey, they finished in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
Company, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, it was able to remove them from Iran, for it helped to a concealed history a outlandish point: they left with Canadian passports, like members of the cinematographic equipment that examined the location in the country for the running of a science overproduction fiction.
Combination of sorts
The plan that Toni Mendez drew up to the expert in “exfiltración” required the collaboration of Hollywood.
So that the lie seemed truthful, it was written on the cinematographic project in specialized magazines, organized press conferences, the society of fictitious production even had a real office.
The details on the operation stayed privily during long time, the film has become from the memories of Tony Mendez.
The film of Affleck is a singular combination of several sorts.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a call “to caper movie”, the history of an episode that came out well, a deceit (an example can be the series Ocean's Eleven).
In the film the moods are combined. We find on the one hand documented sequences good of Tehran. In the sequence of credits are emblematic photographies of the time of the events, that were shaped in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this respect.
On the other, typical scenes of Hollywood somewhat lighter, marked by the irony and one weigh exaggeration.
And in addition, scenes of the power station of the company and other institutions: trajeados men who analyze the situation in the table of negotiations, in the corridors of the office, by telephone…
Ben Affleck has been able to reinitiate its race of an excellent way.
The actor, who had been object of ridicules, has become a director respectable and its way to act has stopped being the target of ironic commentaries.
Argon is his third film, after “small Goodbye, Goodbye” (2007) and the thriller “The Town. City of thieves” (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film of Affleck in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where it grew up.
Also, sensitivity to catch the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that located to the directors of old films over standards of Hollywood.
And Affleck demonstrates it in Argon, where Tehran “wheel” in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the truthful events. The introductory sequence of the taking of the embassy is impressive by its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, the emotion of the disagreement passes on and of the lack of forecast that arises when, in some place, history gives a step forward.
Affleck and its collaborators secure a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the cheating equipment in the bazaar of Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained history does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And one fixes them rather well. Sometimes it adds something to him to the reality: here it does not leave everything so elegant way (the scene in which it watchs the crisis in the airport of Tehran, the deviation from a call to America and the wild search after their track become a madness).
The Argon leanness is the uncontrol that arises from the necessity to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very graceful paper like collaborator of Hollywood, although their characters deserved more space and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this films.
By these reasons, the film of Affleck loses a little dramatic outline, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, to value its accomplishment and the retro style of a thriller that evokes years 70.
But that collapses, that will be difficult.
Like evocation of a real history and test of the exaggerated thing that they can be the slight knowledge of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services, it is sufficient.
Rules for the inflation of globes, bananas and circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com servant, who every year presents a survey on the more absurd banking rates, now has decided to announce the contest on “the regulation or the most absurd ideas of the factory of the EU”.
“It happened us after the last event, the EU has predicted to approve a quota of the 40 percent of women in control points in the great European companies”, explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Between the name absurdities it is, for example, the recent decision of the European court to unify the insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, the women surpassed themselves of better prices in the life insurances because they represent a smaller risk objectively.
“Other incredible ideas of the factory of the EU can be propose by people until the end of this year”.
The election will take place to end of the month of February of 2013”, informed Nacher.
Between the controversial regulations of the EU it is, for example, the obligatory addition of biocomponentes to the fuel that, like result, damages the environment; another prohibition is the use of the mercury thermometers of all the life only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the directive shades the size of the cages of the hens, that has contributed to the considerable increase of the price of eggs this year.
The factual prohibition has been criticized to use the expression “butter to grease” or the retirement of the classic light bulb of the commerces.
A quality banana must have a length of 14 centimeters.
Equipment of the Union often takes this type from decisions under the pressure of one or the other mercantile lobby or industrial, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, with the threat of I even veto, vindicates the exigencies of his banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, of which the bananas of greater quality must at least have in the EU a length of 14 centimeters and they could not present “abnormal curvatures”.
The European Commission was defended saying that with this it only looks for to until now, harmonize the not homogenised national norms that only complicated their commercialization.
The norms that make reference to fruits and vegetables in the EU, in spite of the opposition of some states, have smoothed on the base of which the existing directive entails a waste of foods.
The candidate to gain the survey could be the prescription of the EU of the last year according to which in the inflatable globes that are commercialized it is obligatory to notice that the smaller children of 8 years are not authorized to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The EU made reference here to an American study according to which, when speech of toys, the globes are the main cause of infantile death by asphyxia.
Also a similar restriction applicable to the use of matasuegras on the part of children of up to 14 years is effective.
Peculiar occurrences are even born in our country
Equally absurd it is the regulation referring to the European civil servants: all that one that has some official function in the EU cannot use the denomination of Macedonia. Not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, one is due to speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com servant, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, name in the survey, between some mentioned absurd proposals more above, the prescription of the Union on the volume of the food provisions in the territory of a Member State.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food provisions that can be in the territory of the Czech Republic the same day from our entrance to the EU.
Later, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the volume established for conserve mushrooms, which supposed a threat to him of substantial fine.
To the organizers of the survey also it interested the occurrence to pay to them to those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea to grant a subsidy for the subsidy request.
This class of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in the Prague.
“We are disadvantaged due to not having sea.
We ask for to the European Union a compensation”, it declared in autumn of the 2004 then minister of Jaroslav Palas agriculture (ČSSD).
It argued it with the fact that in our country much cereal took place and, as a result of the calls intervention buyings, the state had the full warehouses and it had to export.
According to Shovels, since the Czech Republic is far from the seaports, the EU would have to pay hundreds to us of million Euros.
In the end, the European Commission was arranged to help to the Czech Republic and organized a public contest for the purchase of the cereal of the countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy to receive a subsidy went propose to the municipalities by the ministry for the local development directed by minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Concretely, he is destined to the writing of requests of subsidy of Brussels.
The EU: The rare prescriptions are an exception
The directives of the Member States are often white of critics, the efforts of the EU in the matter of regulations and, also, a more effective operation and development in all the Union deserve rather, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to the experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of subsidy of the EU for projects that do not have anything to do with the deepening of the European integration, but that the Member States have obtained in the negotiations on budgets.
To the Czechs also it touches the chord to them, in the same way that to other countries of the Union, the fight by the right to the appellation of origin of its traditional products, although our country not always has left victorious these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with German and Austrians, successfully defended the appellation of origin of the ricotta of Olomouc, but they had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country goes back to century XIX, and happened to be called “tuzemák”.
Only the products made from the sugarcane distillate can be denominated rum, but not those facts from sugar beet.
In the official listing of appellations of origin protected of the EU, along with well-known cheeses feta and gorgonzola anywhere in the world, the marzipan of the German city Lubeck or ham of Parma, already are for example cakes of Karlovy Vary, the carp of Pohořelice and Třeboň and, even, the variety of hops of Žatec.
Like protected gangs of the EU, they could be proud of the gingerbread of Pardubice and the rolled wafers of Hořice v Podkrkonoší.
People want that she saves the republic, but I am a fan, affirms Okamura
Sir senator, how it happened oneself to him to appear to the elections for president?
Is not to be senator or president.
If in our country it was all good, then it would not present my candidacy.
But no longer I can support to see how one in the last robs twenty years in our country, how the thieves are unpunished, are increased to the taxes and the age of retirement.
It did not have ambitions of being politician.
When I see something that I do not like, attempt to give with a solution to change it.
And since or I am forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only possibility that I must to change the things is to present like senator or president to me.
At the Senate already it has arrived, but shortly after it has been put in way towards the presidency.
It isn't giving the back to those people who have voted it?
I always said that my candidacy to the presidency depended on the results in the elections of the Senate.
Later I needed that if left chosen senator, it would present my candidacy to the presidency.
But my objective is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make reality my own ideas.
For that reason I need the greater possible influence and the mandate more hard possible.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticized in the bar or in front of the television, but tread down to whatever it wants to initiate a change.
To this the mass media are added to him, that discredit to you and confuse the freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
Of me one says that I have bribed journalists or who I have been adviser of Jiří Paroubek.
We are going to speak of its ideas.
One appears to the presidential fight with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of the property over twenty million.
For it must change the law.
As president does not have this competition and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How it wants to solve it?
Like citizen, I have been member of a pressure group so that the guide office was clear like independent work, and we obtained it.
The problem is in the policy: if somebody arrives with a good proposal, or of rights or lefts, it is rejected on purpose and this affects the citizens.
Like independent candidate, I have a potential major to obtain the support of all the parliamentary groups.
Without classifications nor dogmas of party, I have the capacity to be able to choose something of each party that is better our country and to apply it.
Consider itself rather does a man of rights or lefts?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more of lefts.
For me it does not have importance, or a little lefts or a little rights.
What it matters to me is that we leave ahead.
It does not matter to me if somebody is of rights or lefts, I want to unite to people.
Always support openly any good solution, independent of if the proposal it comes from the KSČM or the ODS and, in the same way, I will be against the bad ideas.
It makes joke when one says of You that you are Populist.
But it isn't demonstrating it and so it says?
When an enterprise plan for the company is created, you also have certain objectives and ideals.
And you try to approach you them.
There will be some who call it Populism, but all the proposals of which I speak or work in the world or well-known experts speak of them.
But without the support of the parliament only it has left slogans.
And in this way it cannot survive in the long term in the policy.
Or create do you who if she goes to the people and she speaks with them, will obtain, for example, a criminal responsibility and financial?
I do not have another option.
To convince politicians, to journalists and the civil society and to try to put them of my part to obtain it.
If outside chosen president, there would not be problem in organizing a broadcasting in direct by television in which it would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties that legitimized the criminal responsibility and financial for politicians, civil servants, judges and public prosecutors of the state.
And, possibly, they would have to communicate because they do not wish it.
If there is a strong character who indicates the disputes, pressure in the political scene can be done.
We take by case the direct election of the president, who has been a profit of the public pressure.
At the same time I affirm that only I am a fan, I am not neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals attempt to look for allies.
I finish beginning in the policy and attempt to obtain the greater possible support for my program.
Attempt to remove to the things I myself ahead, but in case it does not come out well, within six years I will leave it and return to the private sector.
It sounds a little as if Okamura went to save the Czech Republic.
I am not any rescuer.
I know that with a person I do not do anything, for that reason have visited a series of known personalities, in case perhaps they cheered up to present its candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but one refused because it had much work.
As for me, at least I have supported the journalist of Jana Lorencová investigation, that brought to light the frauds with light oils from heating.
I appeared assuming that people are really unsatisfied, now I am in the balance.
The sixty percent of the population did not go to the ballot boxes and, those that did it, voted to the representatives of establishment.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, in such a way that he will be complicated to obtain changes.
Nevertheless, I will defend my own ideas, like for example the direct election of mayors or governors.
It is whereas clause to form its own party?
Not yet I have not considered it because I do not have time for it, to verify the past faultless of each one of the member potentials of the party, nor have money either.
I do not have money nor for the campaign to the presidency, in my account is only transparent are 20,000 crowns.
It doesn't have money?
Speech of declarations of the property, how she is hers?
I consider my private property in about 60 million.
In the Prague I have a land evaluated in 25 million, a evaluated floor ten million, another floor appraised in eight million, a work collection of art with a value of ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued in a million, and in the account I have a pair of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, that she drived this car, he was gallant with the women and, at the same time, fought against the badnesses and injustices.
Lead does a Aston Martin, is its property evaluated in 60 million and it doesn't have money for the campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic but she does not want to put too much money of his part.
He is not very convincing.
I do not have 15 million for the campaign.
I have to become indebted to me?
In the campaign already I have put 2.5 million.
The fact that it does not have any sponsor demonstrates that there is no too much interest in my program.
And I do not have the obligation to pay the campaign with money of my pocket.
The expenses of the campaign cover in essence which I will receive for senator pay.
But it could not live on it. For example, the English school could not pay to him to son, that costs 30,000 monthly crowns.
If it only wanted to make money, then it would not present to me like candidate.
So it will follow with its enterprise activity to be able to live?
It hasn't said before it was going to leave this activity?
This does not have anything to do with a greater pay.
Since there am fiance, partly I have left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will happen to be my substitute in spring.
People would want that the Samaritan one outside that she saved the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much it is used to winning monthly like businessman?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, that itself winning.
If outside president, then would leave the businesses.

The study of architecture MVRDV demonstrates that the true adventures not only are in the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and just finished “book mountain” - 2 photos
“I believe that the building is funny, it has a futurist aspect, and finally there is something interesting that to see”, affirms Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by who happens through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, technician of YOU in a great company located near the library, aims: “in addition, the building is beautiful”.
But I wonder myself why we needed a library nowadays.
All we have electronic Internet, tablets and books.
Nobody enters those old-fashioned libraries in vain, no?
Spijkenisse, a commuter town located to the doors of Róterdam that as soon as it deserves a fleeting visit, shows the doubtful honor of to have raised with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants presents the rate of lower alphabetization of the Netherlands.
In order to resist this so shameful situation, some years ago it was decided to contribute somehow to the general culture and to copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear represented in tickets of Euro in the form of reinforced concrete miniatures decorated.
The success of the educative offensive was limited.
And thus it was as the political people in charge decided that only a possibility existed to improve the statistics: it was necessary to construct a library!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch study of architecture MVRDV, everything a teacher in the art of the bar charts and person in charge of funny at the same time as cynical buildings, took the subject with its habitual serenity and upon presentment appeared of the contest in 2003 with five books under the arm and smile in the face.
And while the jury looked around perplex at his and he shrank of shoulders, Maas came to pile up books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: “Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, the denominated “Boekenberg””.
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million Euros rises in the predicted place.
This one form leaves from the revitalisation project, that is completed with an underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a pair of back-to-back buildings of houses and.
At the beginning of November the book mountain was awarded with the second prize “Best Library of NL 2012”.
In addition, the project also is name to the “Dutch National Wood Award 2012”.
Of this form, small city devoid of history, that to date it did not have nothing else to offer that a pedestrian zone posmoderna and an incredibly ugly city council after whose white facade one would intuit a milk power station rather, counts now on a work of contemporary architecture.
But mainly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building of its history.
The long way until the book
The first impression is that it is a book paradise under a quesera.
It is certain well that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountainous bulk, but the true lovers of the space and the reading do not use it, but they prefer to be fused with his topography to each passage of his scaling to the top.
The completely glazed interior is luminous and easy to include with the view, the ground of expert brick and the elegant lampposts support of unequivocal form the public condition of the library.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
When raising the view can be gotten to visualize the banks of the park, the dogs and the children and children playing soccer.
And by all sides books, books and more books.
“Normally the book bookcases are prepared throughout the facade and in center an enormous dark room is opened that, generally, usually is something uncomfortable and impersonal”, it affirms Winy Maas.
What we have done we are to put legs above the classic space configuration and to remove the zone from reading of the interior to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well taken advantage of: in means are the offices, the library of Internet, the club of chess, the center of environmental education and the room of maintenance.
Special mention deserves the black bookcases that assume the coating functions mural, parapet and railing at the same time.
The view, the tact and the sense of smell are strange.
The civil architects and engineers to the day even more shake the head when they hear speak of this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with materials recyclings”, explains Joop Trouborst to us, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And thus it is like a day, in an agricultural operation Friesland, we ran into with the by-product adapted coming from agriculture.
For many years, in the greenhouses and the fields of the Netherlands a plastic weave of little millimeters of thickness is used as it bases to hold the roots of the cultures.
One is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine weave lasts two stations and later it is rejected.
For the library this weave was pressed, for the first time in such amounts, until obtaining plates of four centimeters of thickness.
With the heat and the pressure, denominated the plastic agriculturist (KLP) changes of color and she becomes a dark, homogenous and resistant material that smells of a mixture of car new and sneaker of sport.
After 105 steps it is arrived at the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain it waits the reward to us: from the cafeteria not only a fantastic view of the city is had, but in her also it is possible to be enjoyed some flavorful Dutch croquettes and their rubber plants planted in enormous flowerpots.
These create an pleasant atmosphere at the same time as maintain the suitable atmospheric humidity for this mountain of Literature.
Donations for a new soul
“Although it costs to believe given it his great glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project with regard to the ecology”, indicates Trouborst.
The necessary heating and the refrigeration are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the book mountain is located under an enormous crystal pyramid, even in the sunniest days the sun only shines during few hours in its interior.
The enormous wood segments located in cross-sectional sense to the crystal facade serve to give shade and absorb the majority of rays of the sun.
This creates a comfortable inner climate.
The rest is thing of the automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the working skeptic of the sector of the Technologies of the Information, already has itself bold to put the foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig also has been there.
Also, traditional medicine professor Chinese Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She describes the “Boekenberg” like the “delayed soul” as Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place makes a pair of weeks, invited all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book of its private collection.
Of this form it is tried to fill, at the moment, the optical hollows of a library that not yet counts on its complete file; at present it has 70,000 units.
The concept has pierced deep.
The bookcases are filled.
“There is nothing no worse than a half empty library”, affirms architect Winy Maas.
“I believe that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain bond with this building.
All know that its book comprises of the library.
Although it only is there for adorning.
Of this form, study MVRDV has secured to everything a success in that discipline queen who in the specialized jargon knows herself like “creation of an identity”.
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of Literature.
Independent of young and the uncultivated thing that can be.
Finally a starting point to conform its identity.
Szabo: “The Germans must play a role more protagonist”
Germany has abstained in the voting on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert in relations EE. UU. - Europe, this locates to Berlin in a quite arduous diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of week, Germany gave to understand that it would vote against the proposal to grant to the Palestinian territories the condition of observant State of the United Nations.
Nevertheless, finally Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, due to the special relationship that unites to the country with Israel, Germany must have well-taken care of.
But at the same time I believe that either it does not endorse the North American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical with Israel.
During the rise that took place in Libya in March of 2011, Germany also abstained when than era to establish a zone of prohibition of flight was tried.
This one has been declared finally by NATO.
It is to him difficult to Germany to adopt a clear position when they are in game important international subjects?
Yes, thus it is.
This is due to that at the moment it is reorienting his foreign policy, moving away of a led policy, so to speak, by the United States and concentrating in a German foreign policy.
And what makes difficult still more the things are that the European do not have a coherent policy and uniform.
Therefore, the Germans are in crossroads.
Of them it is hoped that they carry out a more independent roll, but are not customary to do it.
I believe that still they are estimating which will be its paper, but already have initiated the way towards “normal” a foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to the countries like France or Great Britain.
What concretely means “normal” an outer policy from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it is national interests, is had to defend positions different from those the United States or their European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in the economic policy, that is to say, exports and their relations with certain regions, as they can be Russia, China or Near East.
The economic interests German are until certain point different from those from other great powers and by that Germany reason it must protect his interests.
Have these economic interests influenced in the position adopted with respect to the conflict in Near East and the voting of the UN?
On the one hand, Germany counts on great markets in Near East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason it does not have to be careful and not to alienate itself either of the Arab public opinion nor of the Arab elites.
This is important, by all means.
But I would not give as much importance him since she is not a totally unilateral relation.
Nevertheless, yes they play a fundamental role in the German considerations.
Its relation with EE has undermined Germany. UU. when abstaining to vote in important decisions like in the voting on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that a as drastic rupture as in the case of Libya has taken place.
Perhaps in this way Germany has managed to win a certain respect.
After all, all this has not made but demonstrate that it is a country to which they take in serious as international actor and whose interests it is necessary to consider.
In Europe different opinions exist about the Palestinian initiative.
However, EE. UU. one has been clearly in favor of I veto.
Disparity of opinions between EE exists. UU. and many European nations?
These disparities due to the American inner policy have always existed.
I believe that the government of Obama privily shows a great understanding towards the European position.
But, because of the political situation that is lived here, it is evident that the government cannot defend in public that position.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions in fact does not have the spread that is attributed to him.
If we analyzed the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not for anything excited with the policy that he develops.
It is difficult to council Germany the close relations to him that maintain with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of their main partners in the EU, by another one?
I believe that he is indeed that what causes that is so difficult for the Germans.
By all means that would be a little easier for the Germans if a coherent and homogenous European policy existed, but it is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of comprising of a being superior, but they must drive the things from his own position.
That is indeed what they are doing now with the Euro.
I believe that in the future Germany it will assume a role of leadership at the time of forcing to Europe to adopt an European position.
By all means that this is not far from easy for Germany, or simply by the relation that maintains with Israel.
This it has been always an arduous subject.
But I believe that the Germans know clearly that they must play the role of independent figure.
See itself does Germany itself in the paper of important international actor? It wishes Germany in fact to assume a protagonist role?
Or perhaps it continues to him being difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany not yet has itself customary, always is something uncomfortable and, by evident reasons, the country it continues to him costing to play a more important role.
If we observed the crisis of the Euro, for example, we see that whenever Germany positions itself like leading actor, antiGermans untie to certain feelings.
This is not easy for the Germans.
One is an old problem and it is that nobody wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries.
Sight of this form, Germany is in a much more difficult position that the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude in front of the different neighbors and opinions and that it is not easy.
The EE influence. UU. in the European policy it falls more and more, but the EU does not cover at the moment that emptiness, who is then?
To the Germans they will not have left more remedy than to assume a role more protagonist.
Even if they do not like, if it is to them disagreeable or if it turns to them into a still more unpopular town, c'est the vie!

“Protection of brands” in China: when Puma and Armani become Chinese brands suddenly
Armani is a well-known brand at world-wide level and Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But, what is Armani Polo?
After this name a denomination registered in China hides officially but that does not have anything to do with the original companies.
However, this one enjoys protection while the true eponyms do not present a demand.
And then it is not even clear that one is going away to give the reason to them.
“To the foreigners it is to them more and more difficult to protect his brands in China”, indicates Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the Taylor Wessing writing desk specialized in violations of rights of protection in the Far East.
Every week a new case arrives table.
The imitators simply add a pair of letters to be able to register their brands.
Of this form, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada Prada-Kny is registered.
The German companies are also copied legally in the same way, as him it has happened to the sport article manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens an archivist in whom it keeps seats from the office of brands of Beijing.
The 14 of September of 2010 a Chinese company solicitd to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also used as the fashionable house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world-wide champions in that to copy and to violate the rights of intellectual property very well is known.
In the great cities of several dedicated plants of falsifications exist exclusively on sale department store.
Nevertheless, the cases of Pattloch are of another nature. By order of its clients, it fights against the fact that the office of brands he grants of official form to the Chinese companies the right to remove benefit from a denomination that already is registered in another place.
The Chinese denominate “Ming Pai Bang” or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term “Dakuan Bang”,
that it makes reference to women who “have fished” to a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel like guilty
“It is detrimental for the business, is necessary to fight against it”, demands Pattloch.
“The brand leaks, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage that undergoes the image is enormous.”
The financial losses and the procedural coasts of the affected sectors are millionaire, mainly in the case of emblematic products of luxury.
According to data of the company of analysis of market CLSA, with a volume of 15,000 million Euros to the China year it is, in size, the third luxury article market and the one that grows to greater rate.
Nevertheless, to obtain the cancellation of inscriptions of doubtful legality in the registry of brands is complicated and in addition it supposes much money.
The processes can be prolonged up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speech of cases in which the court rejected a demand because as much time had passed that the name object of the demand already had become a “reality of market”.
“If the plaintiff has bad luck, perhaps even she must pay money to the plagiarist because the process has damaged to the brand of this one in China”, she indicates Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the law of the forest.
Some of the known cases more have to do with graphical elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz it lost a lawsuit against the manufacturer of machinery of Sany construction, the company that has been absorbed recently by the German manufacturer of pumps Putzmeister concrete.
For that reason day of today the Chinese can continue using an emblem very similar to the star of Mercedes.
The buyer of Volvo, Geely, at the outset used a logo in blue target and that remembered to a great extent to BMW; the subject was dissolved in the courts and Geely had to modify it.
The manufacturer of Lacoste clothes lost in China against imitators coming from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposed direction of the original one.
The Chinese authorities do not feel like guilty.
The office of brands CTMO in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and manpower level.
The last year, nevertheless, “in emergency labor situation returned to normality”.
Of this form, the amount of processes of claim without transacting has been reduced in a 22%.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were solved resolute, a 75% more than the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 claims follow resolution slopes.
To fight against this hill much money
As usually he is habitual in China, the numbers are surprising.
The past year the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million requests of protection of brands, almost a third more than in 2010.
One would be a new record and it means that China anywhere in the world leads by tenth consecutive year the list of new inscriptions, according to indicates the office of brands.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, number that ascends altogether to 5.5 million.
In 2011 1,800 million Yuan for rights would have pocketed.
Said of another form, this means that of average each inscription it costs 1,280 Yuan or 160 Euros.
To fight against this hill much money, as it demonstrates the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years the group fights in the courts against a Chinese imitator.
Although the Germans have been able to stop the illegal manufacture of pieces of imitation automobile,
the imitator has managed to make sure the Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
“We ourself we have brought about this situation because in Germany the last names are not protected”, it indicates to Hanno Wentzler, President and Delegated Advisor of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The office of brands CTMO also rejected the resource of the inhabitants of Munich.
In the two following instances they have given the reason him to Freudenberg, but the opposite part at present continues fighting.
It is necessary to have very many well-taken care of
Now the case has arrived at the doors from the Court Superior from Justice, where it follows resolution slope.
Wentzler trusts being able to solve the question favorably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
Nevertheless, also it affirms that “the procedure is extremely expensive, as much in terms of money as of time”.
It is difficult to consider the internal costs; the enterprise file has had to review files of up to one hundred years of antiquity being able to present evidence.
Five Freudenberg years ago it offered to the opposite part a “sum of six numbers in Euros” with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it was not successful.
“This demonstrates much that it matters to us”, it indicates Wentzler.
The dangers that watch in the Far East even threaten affecting to Europe,
concretely if the imitators make sure there right on brands nonprotected.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the Freudenberg name for shoes and products leather.
A long time ago the group left this commercial scope, despite managed to prevent the inscription.
“It is necessary to be very many careful”, affirms Wentzler.
As much it as Pattloch lawyer recommends to the German companies that are extremely prudent at the time of making businesses with China.
It is not enough with trusting the international legislation on rights name brand, but what there is to do it is “to also register in China everything what it can be susceptible of protection”, as points Wentzler.
Otherwise, the subject can be much more expensive that a simple registry.
In fact, in case Freudenberg lost the last assault of its particular battle, then it would have to pay to the opposite part right of license by its own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment at issue would expel to us from the market.
World-wide day of the fight against AIDS: to dance, to sing, to help
In Heidelberg he tries the Imbongi choir and in Swaziland the orphans of AIDS are glad
The history of an able bond of which to surpass much more of 8,733 kilometers of distance.
First one begins by the dance: boots of cowboy, sneakers of basketball, heel shoes and moccasins look for the compass on the parquet ground, and they find it quickly.
, Two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers only begin to rise slowly (alto, low, tenor and soprano), crowding around themselves, getting stuck and following some others.
And Entrust Hopf to you, the director of 29 years, threatens leave almost its squares when trying to put order with its energetic and smooth gestures.
It is Monday in the evening and in the room of music of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg the Imbongi choir tries a new song.
Also the fifty singers have arrived, among 23 and 69 years, from the human geneticist to the housewife.
“Om'Obani” is not a easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and in addition in hardly well-known a foreign language: the Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botsuana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some zones of Swaziland.
Aid for the self-help
According to an estimation of ONUSIDA, the program of the United Nations for the fight against AIDS, anywhere in the world approximately 34 million people infected by the virus of HIV exist.
23,5 million of them live in the south of Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 orphans of AIDS.
More of 40% of the population already she is seropositive.
The association for Voices Africa has found in Germany godfathers for the 180 orphans of the AIDS of the town of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend the secondary school.
By 15 or 20 Euros to the month it is possible to be supported to a boy.
This contribution will cover the matriculation with the school, the uniform and it will guarantee a hot meal to him to the day in Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in narrative Zulu “of histories” or “panegirista”.
In this room nobody knows to speak with fluidity this bantú language, but to sing yes they know.
For ten years this choir tries songs in this smooth foreign language that sometimes manages to transport to them to its place of origin: the south of Africa.
To 8,733 kilometers of in line straight distance from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, a called town Esitjeni exists that depends on the voices of this German choir.
The forty percent is infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud huts and straw, a great part of them is young.
More than 300 no longer they have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example than it affects to Swaziland: the rate of infection of higher AIDS and the lower life expectancies worldwide, according to Unicef.
The population does not see with good eyes the circumcision, a practice that according to has been demonstrated reduces to half the contagion risk.
More of 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland they are carrying of the virus of the immunodeficiency, and to die with a little more thirty years has become something habitual.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the choir discovered this recondite population, but what they saw mainly they were many children in the streets that lacked not only the protection of their parents, but of the main thing: food, clothes and formation.
Without scholastic title, the possibilities in a poor country are than little more.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few what did possible that a boy went to the school and enjoyed a hot meal to the day. All this by a few Euros.
Nevertheless, a year later the choir founded the association “for Voices Africa” that since then it has taken care professionally of the orphans of AIDS in Esitjeni.
Facts on the infections of sexual transmission
Which are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Between the ETS of bacterial origin they are the syphilis, clamidia and the gonorrhea.
The more habitual ETS of viral origin are AIDS, the virus of the human papilloma, the herpes genital or the hepatitis.
The crab lice and the scabies are between the ETS transmitted by parasites.
Which are the main affected groups of?
The syphilis and the gonorrhea occur with more frequency in men than they maintain sexual relations with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute leaves from the base of which at least four of each five registered cases of syphilis in Germany have their origin in a sexual contact between men.
In the case of the heterosexual adults the most habitual sexually transmitted diseases are the infections by clamidia, tricomonas, the virus of the human papilloma, the candidiasis (fungus) and the gonorrhea.
The contagion of HIV between the heterosexual adults of the country is relatively little; however, approximately 20% of the new infections by HIV are registered in this group.
Between the young people, the infections by clamidia are much more habitual that in other groups of population.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all the infections affect to young people among 15 and 25 years.
In our country, the virus of the human papilloma also adds itself to the most habitual diseases between youth.
How evolved has the number of infections?
All the sexually transmitted diseases are not subject to obligatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of infections by syphilis has doubled its number of 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new infections by HIV maintains a descendent tendency from 2007.
In 2011 approximately 2,700 cases were registered.
One is one tenth part less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital zone, annoyances when tinkling, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
Often they do not cause pain neither they bring about other symptoms and for that reason they are not detected.
How can one be protected?
The preservatives can reduce the contagion risk, but they do not offer protection to the one hundred percent.
Some pathogenic agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also transmit themselves through infections by dirt and physical contact.
For this reason, the experts recommend to be put under medical examinations regularly, mainly if he changes frequently of sexual pair.
If they are diagnosed of early form, the majority of the ETS can be cured and is possible to avoid any delayed consequence.
Through collaborations, donations and, finally but for that reason less nonimportant, from the honoraria that the choir by its activities in all Germany acquires, get to collect money enough.
“Altogether we have sent already about 200,000 Euros to Esitjeni”, it indicates proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the own Zodwa Dlamini town a safe woman of itself and with dowries of leadership administers the money sent from Germany.
One takes care of which the orphans find a good lodging, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The “gogos”, as it denominates to the women majors in Zulu, are the pillars of the town.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans to their position, they offer a ceiling to them where to live and they take care of which the children go to the school every day precise and dressed in their uniforms.
Those that does not have to are under the protection of Khanyisile, an unmarried woman who, like the two cooks which they are in charge to cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a wage of the association.
In addition, “Voices of Africa” has started up a seam school, has constructed two hen houses and, in collaboration with the sanitary organization American PSI, it has obtained who many of the inhabitants of the town have been put under a test of HIV.
This is not something obvious, since, in spite of it patents it that it is this disease in all the country, usually it is not spoken openly of her.
A king with 14 spouses
“AIDS is an absolute taboo”, affirms Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with the sexuality”.
Something strange in a country in which the king has 14 spouses officially.
The last absolute monarch of África Negra, king Mswati III, is met by his lifestyle opulent and filled with excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This form of accepted life officially is not to a large extent responsible for the so fast propagation that the virus of HIV in the last decades has experimented.
But also one is due to the innumerable seasonal workers who cross the country from a side to another one and that they take it there where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, “in any corner preservatives can be obtained free, but these as soon as they are used.
It is another culture, only accept the contact here skin against skin”.
In order to foment the cultural interchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years by the south of Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, fighting spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the most southern end of the African continent still remember of the time of the apartheid.
A full bus of targets that sing songs in a black language; as much recognition not only brings with himself an excellent atmosphere and much joy, but also it has managed to take a pair to him of tears to which another rabid border soldier.
The trip always takes to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the young sponsored people.
Although this small population as soon as it appears in the maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river is very well-known.
“Approach to you Esitjeni, shines the light there”, affirm the people of the place.
And after crossing the 8,733 kilometers in line straight of return to Heidelberg until the rooms of test of the Bergheimer street filled with singers marking the step, one realizes of which also it is possible to see shine his light thence.
Messenger: The NASA discovers Mercury ice
The Messenger sounding has found tests of the Mercury ice existence.
Probably the ice layer has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The NASA, the North American space agency, have presented evidence of the Mercury ice existence.
In spite of being the planet nearest the sun, also there is frozen water there, as Thursday in the specialized magazine “Science” is come off three published studies.
The Messenger sounding would have found tests that in the zone of the planet that is permanently in the shade has formed an ice layer.
It seems that this one has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters of thickness.
The water comes presumably from comets or, with great probability, from asteroids that at the time hit against Mercury.
Nobody relates the ice finding to the possibility that life in the planet exists, affirms the investigating head of the Messenger sounding, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
Nevertheless, the findings could help to clarify how the water and other components have arrived from the life at other zones of the Solar System.
Of completely inadvertent form for the inhabitants of the planet Earth, the soundings, telescopes and small robots as the Phoenix is dedicated to explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to the Earth: small windows to the immensity of the space.
The image comes from a camera developed by investigators German of the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that conform our Solar System, besides the Ceres dwarf planet.
Like Pluto, that turns around the right sun behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the Astronomical Union the International in 2006 Ceres is not any “planet”.
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a “picture of family” in whom they appear infinite generations of stars: the oldest stars are like blue points, although most difficult to recognize it is the pink color of stars “new born”.
This region of star formation, denominated of little romantic form by the W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, to a distance of 6,500 years light.
This iridescent image of a star in extinction was taken by the Spitzer telescope of the NASA.
The ring in the form of doughnut is made up of the material that the star spits in its process of extinction.
In the enormous Trífida Nebula, to 5,400 years Earth light, new stars from gas and dust form.
The Spitzer telescope of the NASA took this photo from the zone of galactic stellar formation.
The Pleiads, a star group also known with the nickname “the Seven Brothers”, they are a visible object at first in the sky nocturne.
Nevertheless, with the telescope the colors can be appreciated better.
The Nebula of the Helix appears as an enormous red eye appears in this infrared image.
One is located to 700 years light of the constellation of Aquarius.
Its similarity with a terrestrial continent has been worth him the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photography and an infrared image gives rise spectacular a colorful one.
This budding star could for the first time be caught in all their splendor by the infra red seekers of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its ring: how they were originated continues being one of the great incognitos of astronomy.
Probably one is rest of one of Saturn moons that disappeared without leaving sign makes 4,500 million years.
One of the majors and clearer photographies taken by the Hubble telescope: the Galaxy of the Eddy.
Following the tonalities, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the Austral European Observatory shows the Trífida Nebula located to several thousands of years light in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The Trífida name comes from the Latin term “trifidus” (divided in three), since some dark lines of dust divide the burning heart of this zone of stellar formation in three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco the astronomers could photograph the indications of a cosmic cannon: to 400 million years Earth light the nuclei of two galaxies in fusion process rush the one towards the other to end up hitting of irremediable form.
This star formation was caught by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those that does not like of technical abbreviations can talk about to her with the nickname of Austral Pinwheel.
The photography of the space telescope Hubble shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cefeo.
The nebula located to 1,400 years light is composed by particles of dust whose size is between ten and one hundred times smaller than the one of the dust particles that we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and of x-rays done by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located to 430 million years Earth light.
This group of galaxies, denominated Arp 273, for a moment served as model for the space telescope Hubble of the NASA.
The scientists denominate spiral galaxy larger UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the young star group more brilliants of our Vía Láctea.
This zone of stellar formation produces new stars constantly.
In this star cloud, associated to the Cloudy Rosette, they also arise continuously new star; to 5,000 years Earth light.
In this so shining galaxy with a small black hole not yet there is dust, only gas.
The investigators suppose that bang formed shortly after big, when in the universe hydrogen could be found mainly.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it later a year to observe stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have not stopped to grow and the images that offer to us have depth more and more.
During 30 years, concretely from 1947 to 1975, the telescope Pulls ahead located in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was greatest of the world.
Its mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, EE. UU., rises the Binocular Large Telescope.
This one allows to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The Canary interior of the Great Telescope located in the island of the Palm is enormous - the mirror only has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
In spite of it, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The disadvantage of this economic construction is than the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, reason why its mobility is limited.
The Hobby telescope in Roofing tiles also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularitity is its enormous capacity to pick up light.
In spite of counting on a diameter of comparativily smaller mirror, this capacity is comparable to the one of the greater telescopes of mirror of the world.
With the help of the radio telescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico) the investigators can explore the universe in search of signals of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the “Search of Extraterrestrial Intelligence” (SETI by its abbreviations in English) any person can help who owns a computer, contributing processing capacity.
Vista of the Austral European Observatory (THAT) located in Chilean the Andes.
Here the Very Large Telescope rises, a telescope that makes honor to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the infrared phantom half.
THAT also will welcome the denominated E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or Extremely Great European Telescopio).
Its primary mirror will include 42 meters and will be made up of a total of 1,000 reflecting elements.
Until 2018 it is not hoped to be able to take images.
Until 2007 both Keck telescopes located in the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered greatest of the world.
These count on two mirrors, each of them with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes comprise of the Observatory Mauna Kea, that next to them explores the sky with the aid of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is predicted to construct a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a diameter of mirror of thirty meters.
This one is an image of how it would be.
Nevertheless, the most important information of the cosmos arrives from the hand of the space telescope Hubble to us.
From the 24 of April of 1990 it sends distant world images.
From March of 2009 the space telescope Kepler looks for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are inhabitable.
The 2 of February of 2011 the NASA announced that from the beginning of their mission 1,235 candidates to planets had been located.
In the image the last previous preparations are seen the launching of the space telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope telescope (JWST) will not be sent to the space on board a rocket Ariane 5 until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for the light of first stars and galaxies formed after big bang.
The investigators leave from the base of which in the Mercury South Pole also there is ice.
Nevertheless, convincing tests, since do not exist the Messenger sounding turns around the planet in an orbit much more near the North Pole.
For decades the measurements of radar aim at the Mercury ice existence.
Thanks to the Messenger sounding (2004), first that orbit around Mercury, now the scientists have the certainty that he is thus.
To drink butter on a daily basis and to live 168 years
To the south of Azerbaijan many people manage to reach Biblical ages.
There a museum dedicated to the longevity exists even.
A search of tracks in a country in which the people of 97 years still are considered young.
To the south of Azerbaijan many people manage to reach Biblical ages.
There a museum dedicated to the longevity exists even.
A search of tracks in a country in which the people of 97 years still are considered young.
The route by the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as romantic savage and.
The minibus advances with great noise through the winding highway that happens next to wooded hills, rivers of great volume and the simple houses of the local farmers.
Everything is green and substantial, one could even think that it is in Selva Negra.
Nevertheless, we were in the most southern zone of Azerbaijan; from the border with Iran one is to only some kilometers here.
Here “talyshi” live, a town of which it does not know much, aside from that perfectly dominate Persian and the Azeri and that they are very long-lived.
Our final destiny is Lerik.
This small city is conceited of a perhaps designed too massive architecture in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit absolutely in a so colorful mountainous landscape.
The European tourists as soon as they arrive at this place, since the way from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
In order to cross the 323 kilometers that separate both urban nuclei, eight hours are needed because the highway is of a single sense.
The amazing wealth which it not yet enjoys the country thanks to the petroleum of the Caspian Sea has arrived at this recondite region.
Nevertheless, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what there is to have to become a tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the celebration of the Festival of Eurovisión and the next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people of the world”, indicates Fatulayeva.
One is the director of the Museum of the Longevity, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.
Here the life of eight dozens of talyshis of the place is documented that have surpassed the 100 years of age. Fatulayeva indicates an image in black and white.
This one is my grandfathers, who lived 120 years.
A son his died at the age of 136 years
Nevertheless, the unquestionable star of the museum is the shepherd of ewes Șirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, any game of birth does not exist that certifies it.
And if we consider that the man of greater documented age lived 122 years, seems that the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious.
“It was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973”, explains Fatulayeva to us.
The man was married in three occasions and had 23 children. Apparently still he had time to conceive a daughter at the age of 136 years.
Been mistaken then has Șirali Müslümov in its age in a pair of decades?
Nevertheless, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontólogo in the Institute Max Planck de Rostock, also have heard speak of the outpost age of this inhabitant of Central Asia.
“In some regions of China, Japan or in the valley of Hunza in Pakistan also lives very elderly people”, affirms Scholz, “even in Sardinia are many men majors”.
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to present scientific evidences about the age; especially when any civil registry does not exist either.
Every day full glasses of melted butter
It is a cause that, of form surprising frequents, the inhabitants of the region located around Lerik usually they reach a Biblical age.
At present there are 20 people who surpass the 100 years of age.
Why they live here, in the south, so many elderly people?
The tour guide Azeri Farid Mugimzadeh explains that she is the special genes of talyshis.
The director of the museum, the Mrs Fatulayeva, creates however that the cause resides in the feeding.
Nevertheless, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that indeed the rich feeding in calories of talyshi, that they adore the meat, the bread and mainly the milky products and many of which, in addition, drinks a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthful.
Or perhaps is the form of natural life the one that maintains young people? In Cengemiran, a small establishment far from the city of Lerik does not live Rubaba Mirzayeva.
To its 97 years it is relatively young so estila by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, that it affirms to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple typical wood house of all the region of the Caucasus.
Sitting in the ground, moves of untiring form an enormous bathtub of butter.
Eight people live under a ceiling, among them one of the children and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents a long time ago.
Also they jump of a side to another two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea who serve in some typical glasses with convex form.
The teeth of Mirzayeva are white and perfectly are aligned and under the handkerchief it hides two long braids of dark blond hair that his son discovers to us proud.
I have always washed the hair with milk, for that reason never one has fallen and it maintained its color to me.
“I have used never a shampoo Either”, affirms Mirzayeva.
The pension is sufficient to live
Of always it has eaten only what produced in its own farm: tomatos, potatoes and peas.
In all my life I have never been going to make the purchase to a supermarket.
Then it speaks to us of his husband, who was in the army.
The worse thing was the time subsequent to World War II.
Nevertheless, everything returned to its channel when the “dear father”, Heydar Aliyew, took the control from the situation.
This type of propaganda sounds rare in mouth of a greater woman.
Nevertheless, in Azerbaijan the cult that is professed to the paternal figure of the nation, that directs its country like a dictator, does not know limits.
This one stayed in the power until 2003, moment at which yielded the witness to its Ilham son.
The adults of Azerbaijan at least do not know what is the poverty.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manat (approximately the same amount in Euros) for monthly pension, an amount with which it is possible to be lived here well considering the situation.
And perhaps the grey-haired son of Mirzayeva is right: “in our culture the majors are very respected”.
They live in a great family, are loved, they receive all the necessary cares and they are happy.
As if this was not reason sufficient to stay with life many years…
In the Constitution the expression needs “Human rights”
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Manifestations that compete to each other in Cairo show the tremendous division in which the country is sunk.
The future constitution, with the sharia as it bases, is very controverted.
The Egyptian president did not scrimp in pathos.
“We must surpass the transition.
And that happens is my responsibility, before the town and God”, it affirmed in the public television.
Its speech went directed to all the town, mainly to the Christian Copts, the liberal ones, the informed Muslims and the secular ones.
All of them, sunk without remedy until now in a confused opposition, are scared.
Fear of a theocracy to borders of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost apologising, he has had to annul of temporary form the competitions of the Constitutional Court and to extend his “to be able to save the revolution”.
Nevertheless, neither Egyptian nor the entire world knows very or what this engineer of 61 years with a title of doctorate granted by the University of Southern Californiums wants to really save.
It tries to prevail of his power to the judicature?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed member percent predominantly islamists in a nocturnal meeting of 15 hours of duration, are truly worrisome.
Like in previous constitutions, in the rough draft also one says that the jurisprudence is based on the “principles of the Islamic right”.
Nevertheless, what means that of “principles”?
This was and continues being open the interpretation and seems that the islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal manoeuvre margin that takes prepared, to impose a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
This is at least what suggests a new added article: in all the questions regarding the sharia it is obligatory to consult to the University To - the Ashar, the more important Islamic institution of the country with a great power in all the Sunni Islam.
It thus does not have why to be, but this can mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - would have like result the incapacity of the judicature.
Great part of the rough draft of the constitution is open to the interpretation
What also it is problematic is that tries to maintain the military jurisdiction.
During the dictatorship of Mubarak these courts served to exert one lasts repression on the opposition.
After it fell it of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians were prisoners in military prisons.
As it establishes the rough draft, the State has to protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “to promote its moral and its values”.
One is a so imprecise formulation in legal terms that with the aid of this article the state institutions could even control the contents of the cinematography and Literature.
Speaking clear one is not another thing that of censorship.
By the way that no article establishes of explicit form the equality between men and women.
However another one prohibits to offend or to slander to Prophet Mohammed and his legacies.
Nevertheless, it is not clear what is an offense and how there is to be sanctioned.
The same of doubtful it is the formulation that prohibits the “offense to the people”
Is sufficient a cartoon of the president or a joke on a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the rough draft that has been presented to Mursi for its signature and that according to, its words, “in a moment” will be presented the Egyptians to be put under referendum.
“The revolution has returned”
For weeks the opposition has been close up against the superiority of the islamists.
Ten thousand people met in an unusual harmony in afternoon of Friday in the Tahrir place of Cario and swore to make fail the Act before she can enter in force.
“The revolution has returned and we will end up winning”, affirms Hamdin Sabbahi, that it occupies the third place in the lists to the presidential elections.
Nobel of La Paz and ex-director of the Organism the International of Atomic Energy, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the rough draft of the constitution would have to be “in the dustbin of history”.
Through Twitter it accused the followers of Mursi to want to lead a “coup d'etat against the democracy”.
“When it summons the referendum we go to its palace and we overthrow it”, it affirms the opponent Jasser Said.
“Not yet we are tired, the blood of our brothers not yet has been atoned for”, mentioned in Egyptian means the competing politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to supervise the referendum, reason why would not be considered valid.
“Quran is our constitution”
On the other hand, the Muslim community organized good made a call to celebrate a counter demonstration; just in case not in the Tahrir place, but after an oration to the other side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and those in favor with the Salafist ones took part in the same to the shout from: “the town demands the application of the divine law”.
They demanded to Mursi “to clean the country”, at the same time as they proclaimed: “Quran is our constitution”.
A fight by the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir place, where everything began, had brought about a situation similar to the one of a civil war.
It is evident that those in favor of Mursi did not want to risk to that something thus happened.
The Muslim brothers as much affirmed that those that are against clearly to the rough draft of the constitution as those in favor of the same would have expressed their opinions high and.
Now the moment would have arrived for leaving the town decided in the ballot boxes what direction would have to follow the country.
In this sense, it seems that the rough draft of the islamists has guaranteed the majority.
“The expression “Human rights” not even appears”
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that in fact must have lasted until February and salary including a all the social forces.
This lawyer of 48 years specialized in human rights and president of the Egyptian Organization of Human rights (EOHR) defended to the Muslim brothers when they were retained in prison or they had to do against a judgment during the dictatorship of Mubarak.
Because it did not share his ideology, but because for him the Human rights are indivisible.
For this reason it was struck, condemned and jailed.
“And now the expression “Human rights” not even appears in the new constitution”, is lamented in a conversation with the newspaper “Welt a.m. Sonntag”.
The extension of the competitions of Mursi to the three powers of the State caused that this lawyer resigned himself.
The adopted measures are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will take to Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of fortifying the civil society, which has made the president is to abolish it”, Saeda is lamented.
Nevertheless, the democracy cannot work without the organizations of the civil society.
Saeda feels left, also by the international community, which observes the ideological fight that is taking place to borders of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could become in his against.
A demonstrator in the Tahrir place warns: “you are conceiving a monster that you will not be able to control”.
Rakfisk Norwegian: the most evil-smelling fish of the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one the majors standards of life, not only of Europe but of the world.
It is possible that the success of the country bears some relation to its avidity by an extremely evil-smelling fish?
Tome a series from excessively cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of clothes of dirty and humid soccer.
Leave it one week there.
It will be able then to smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of the exquisiteness of Norway.
I am in the small city of Fagernes, to some three hours of Oslo.
He is snowed. The landscape is spectacular and that scent, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is salt meat trout that is let ferment during in water, following the evil-smelling thing that you prefer it, until a year.
As he grows dark and he is being more cold, the Norwegians go in a mad rush to a festival that is celebrated here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this delicacy of, so to speak, more captivating.
“One eats crude and soon a glass of aquavit of a drink drinks”, says Havard Halvarsen, fireman of the city that is also what is called the “General of the Rakfisk”, that is in charge to organize the festival.
By all sides we see people eating this fish that keeps in small important buckets and drinking of a drink amounts of the drink.
“To some people they like plus aquavit that rakfisk”, affirms Havard.
The drink can kill the scent.
I prove some pieces.
If you can avoid to pass it near the nose, he is not bad; he is not very different from a portion of sushi that has crossed a few kilometers in bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in that the poverty whipped Norway and in which, before the refrigeration existed, the fish kept during the autumn submerged in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the heat of winter, when already well it is fermented, removes and, evidently with the inactive senses due to the alcohol, it eats.
It makes only one generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
At the moment, the population is increasing quickly; more of 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, lifted wages and a complete system of social services.
A current of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and until does not too much much more rich who Norway, arrives at this country to work.
Rakfisk considers something important, an essential, although quite evil-smelling part, of the past of Norway.
One is between plates more expensive than they are possible to be bought.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A cane of beer or a sandwich costs the trifle to you of 10€ ($14) each.
Norway usually does not appear in the daily routine of the international news and to the majority of Norwegians they like that thus it is.
Here people still little are prepared to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the extreme right racist who pestered with shots and assassinated 77 people, between whom there were men, women and children.
In its place, they talk about to the shooting like “the event of the 22 of July”.
To the Norwegians it costs to them very many to think that in his calm country one of theirs outside able to commit such cruelty and homicide.
After much of the present wealth of Norway is the growth, since the beginning of the 70, of one of the industries of greater petroleum and gas of the world.
“But petroleum is not the only reason for which it goes to us so well”, it affirms Ana, our waiter, while it is passing trays of rakfisk and that, with his long blond long hair and its surprising blue eyes, it represents the image of the Norwegian well-being.
“We are, as you say, prudent people”.
His English, like the one of the majority of people in this country, is impeccable.
“We do not like to boast, does not like us the ostentation”.
Norway has managed its petroliferous wealth with much caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money coming from this industry, is reversed in a special bottom to the benefit of the future generations.
While everybody squandered money that it did not have during the years that preceded anywhere in the world to the financial crisis, Norway maintained the closed good wallet.
“While we can ski in winter and do hiking in summer, we are contentments”, says Anna.
“And to eat rakfisk”, it adds with an eloquent outburst of laughter.
I am in the snow doing tail to eat something; I have already had sufficient rakfisk.
Now an elk hamburger is without a doubt something different and quite succulent that to savor.
But at night, it returns that evil-smelling fish.
The hotel in which I lodge is one of the many premises in which a dinner of rakfisk is celebrated in which the companions at table vote the best fish, or perhaps the one that puts on approval the nostrils more.
A television has connected in direct with a presenter who takes bow tie and that is surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
It seems the contest of Eurovisión.
“Which are your scores for the best fish arrives there in mountains, Thor-Juergen”
“Here it is our score, Havard.”
There are laughter and applause.
A man falls of the chair, perhaps won by aquavit.
Or perhaps they are the steam of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a duro beginning
While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares himself to take possession from his position, the correspondent of BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION, Will Grant, analyzes the challenges which she will face the new president and the different expectations from his population.
The traffic in City of Mexico is especially bad at the moment.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, already is of in case congested, a steel wall has settled from Monday that cuts several of the main highways that take to the city and that is causing an enormous chaos in the highways.
The objective, however, was not to prevent that the workers could arrive at their place of work, but to avoid that the demonstrators could arrive at the parliament.
Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and will assume the management of the nation.
One faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been obtaining good economic performance during the salient government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is submerged in a war against narcotráfco that has received some already 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government has the great commitment with the Mexican town to reduce the violence”, explained Mr. Peña Nieto at the beginning of this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Office.
“I am going to propose a new strategy of security that will allow us to reach that objective”.
Before elbowing itself with the president of the EE.UU., previous the political experience of Mr. Peña it was like governor of its native state, the one of Mexico.
A state very populated and with a fast growth, that surrounds the capital; The opinions on the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valley of Bravo, for example, one remembers to him with affection.
Their residents attribute the merit to him of the growth of the tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructures.
In order to arrive at the city it is possible to be lead by one of the new highways of Mr. Peña Nieto, which supposes an enormous improvement compared with the highways cracked and full of pockets that were rehabilitated.
Also plates with their name in the entrance of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum can be seen on the climate change.
“We trusted that he is able to realise a lasting real change and”, he says to his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, deputy of the party of Mr. Peña Nieto, the PRI.
“Particularly, concerning security and economy, we waited for the interesting and true change that our country as much needs”.
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in the power, the PRI was supplanted by Vicente Fox in the year 2000.
Deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of the Pines, within the party there are many expectations with respect to Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the qualification that the opposition for of lack of essence of the new president.
“He is a very sincere man, very it jeopardize and with an excellent vision of the country.
He is a fantastic man of state and above all she is a person who knows to listen.”
Nevertheless, to the other side of the state that is not the impression that has much people on its old governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, well-known also like Neza City, the resistance with Valley the paved streets of Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under high sections of freeway it is, in many senses, a suburb of the own City of Mexico.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year the intervention of the military was requested so that they helped in the fight against the drug bands that operate in the districts and the violence against the women is especially serious.
In a desert parcel, located next to a sweepings garbage dump, they have been left left in only both last years the bodies of dozens of assassinated women.
More than 1,000 women they were assassinated in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a rate much more lifted that the one of Juárez City, unfortunately famous by its violence and a place that is synonymous of homicide of innocent women.
The critics of Mr. Peña Nieto say, in the best one of the cases, that he did not know to approach the problem of feminicidio while he was in the position.
The critics blame their administration more to make the fat view.
In a concrete house, typical of the aggravated district, Irinea Buendía must deliver attacks to contain the tears while it shows photographies to me of his passed away daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Marian one committed suicide in 2010.
Nevertheless, her family thinks that its pair assassinated it.
“When I arrived at its house, it seemed as if they had cleaned the body to him”, it remembers Mrs. Buendía.
“There were signs of which had been struck and the rigor mortis already had appeared”.
While her mother relates history, a photography of Marian observes from the walls, next to a cross in which an only word is read: Justice.
Nevertheless, that is exactly what the family says that has refused to him.
“The authorities of the state have tried to me as if outside an old busybody, an agitator, a complainant.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and that street”.
“But that cannot thus be when there has been so many irregularities and as much negligence”, it affirms.
The presidential sash that President Peña Nieto will receive Saturday will come accompanied from an enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico during last the six years and the new president has promised to give priority them during his mandate.
“I hope that he is the same type of president who was when he was governor”, the deputy of the PRI Olvera in Valley of Bravo says.
Nevertheless, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Neza City fear more.
Bradley Manning did not denounce bad treatments, according to affirm the public prosecutors
The public prosecutors try to do against the denunciations of abuses of Bradley Manning during their stay in prison
The judgment concentrates in the period of Manning in the military prison of Quantico in Virginia
The defense wants that the case being based on that misestimates the imprisonment of Manning was severe
The soldier of the army is accused to rob thousands of confidential documents.
The public prosecutors tried to demonstrate Friday that soldier Bradley Manning, defendant of the greater filtration of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost multiple opportunities to denounce the bad treatments that now that alleges it suffered while was under military halting.
During the interrogation that the office of the public prosecutor realised to Manning in a previous view in the opinion in Ft. Meade, Maryland, fiscal Commander Ashden Fein affirmed that the registries of the weekly visits of officials of the unit that Manning received during nine months of halting in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any denunciation on the treatment that received.
Interrogation, that was carried out during a view realised as a result of the request of the defense of which the case since its imprisonment had been hard and that it already was sufficient assumption punishment, arrived a day after misestimated Manning had testified who had thought about committing suicide while he was lengthy.
The analyst of intelligence of the army, arrested in June of 2010, is accused to rob thousands of confidential documents while he was on watch in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material in Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of intelligence.
In the view of Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that the officials filled up after the visits to Manning during their arrest in the military prison of Quantico, where she was jailed in regime of maximum imprisonment from July of 2010 to April 2011.
The officials would have realised questions to Manning and written down their answers.
When Fein Friday asked on the forms, Manning recognized that she had described the treatment that gave the watchman him like “excellent” and the treatment received in the facilities generally like “very professional”.
Forms not show no denunciation of bad treatments, although the officials asked Manning directly on the treatment that received, affirmed Fein.
Manning responded that she had expressed his preoccupation on some questions and that the officials who visited to him had spoken of those problems and they had indicated to him that they would treat, but that they did not put record of those questions in the registry.
“They wrote “without incidences” (after to have spoken of the problems) but this does not mean necessarily that I had not mentioned any problem”, Manning said.
The judge, Colonel of the Denise Lind Army, also asked Manning why she had not denounced the treatment that received during the meeting that took place in January of 2011 with an advice in charge to examine the intentions of suicide that had expressed in a form months before.
Manning responded that its intention during that one meeting was the one to obtain the reduction of the regime of “prevention of injuries” under which was.
The military said that they had put to him under that restrictive regime, that is a degree below the one of monitoring by possible suicide, to guarantee his protection and the security of other people.
“It wanted that the General Staff knew that I was well and (she wanted) stopping being under prevention of injuries… to be able to enjoy than, from my point of view, it is one better quality of life”, said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and its transfer to Kuwait, where she was retained during almost two months before being transferred to the military prison located in the base of the Marins in Quantico, Virginia, in 2010 July.
It said that it had considered to commit suicide in Kuwait and that in an occasion it lost the knowledge due to the heat.
It said that the fact that was not allowed him to know what it was happening to him or what it happened in the outside world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced only to the Arafjon Camping, to that cage”, explained Manning Thursday.
“I thought that it was going to die in that cage”.
Manning affirmed that, once transferred to Quantico, she passed the majority of the days in a small cell, at least during 21 hours and often during 23 hours, without company.
Manning said that only she allowed herself him to have a mattress, a blanket, some slippers, to something of clothes and his glasses.
It explained that it tried to move all along, since was prohibited to sleep or to even ease up during the day.
Manning affirmed that always she had a light coming from it go aiming at his eyes while she slept.
It said that if the watchman could not see the face him when the return occurred at night, they woke up to him so that the return returned to occur.
The lawyer of Manning presented in January of 2011 a formal claim on the treatment that received Manning.
Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April of 2011.
Friday the judge asked Manning on a plea that had realised in the declaration of Thursday, according to which, after being forced one night to sleep naked in its cell of Quantico, commited himself to him during a morning count to remain desdnudo standing up in front of the watchman and of other prisoners.
Manning had testified who never had occurred the opportunity him to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the interrogation of the judge Friday, Manning said that he deduced by the order that gave the watchman him who had to drop the blanket with which he could have covered, but recognized that nobody had ordered him that dropped it.
Manning testified Thursday that had forced to him to sleep naked the previous night because of an attempt to demonstrate to an official who he did not suppose a danger for itself.
Manning affirmed that she had said to him to the official who could have used the elastic of his underwear or his thongs to autolesionar itself but that she had not done it.
Manning testified that one night they had retired of his cell his underwear, its thongs and their glasses.
Their lawyers have the hope of which the judge considers at least the experiences through which happened during their stay in prison and drastically reduce their sentence in case outside condemned in the council of war, who is predicted that he begins at the beginning of next year.
The defense affirmed that it has predicted to cause that Manning declares culprit of misdemeanors and to defend other considered accusations too extreme.
It is predicted that the view starts again this weekend and hopes that the public prosecutors argue that the conditions of the halting were just.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was retained according to the norms of application all prisoner who is under maximum safekeeping in Quantico.
The positions against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, to illegally bring about the publication of information in Internet, filtration of information of the national defense and robbery of property or registries public.
If it is declared guilty of all the positions, it could face life imprisonment.
My crisis of identity Mexican-American
It affirms that many were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
The Mexicans lie down to criticize to that they went; he says that they remember to the Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that the Mexican-Americans are catched between two worlds.
In a recent trip to City of Mexico, as soon as it had lowered by the esplanade and arrived at the zone of immigration procedure and already he was totally confused.
Some posters indicated the way towards two tails: one for “Mexican” and another one for “Foreigners”.
I remained some there seconds without being safe towards where it had to go.
To the salary grown in California Central, during all my life they have called to me “Mexican”.
One is ethnic shorthand, in the same way in which my friendly of Boston talk about to themselves as “Irish” or my friendly of New York are described to “Italian” themselves.
Later I was decided by “Mexican-American”.
But this was Mexico.
And, in the mother country of my grandfathers, the shorthand or the scripts was not necessary.
Simply he was American.
I speak Spanish. Sufficiently well as to handle to me during an interview in this language.
But I do not have the level of vocabulary of a native one and I cannot undo of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I put myself in the tail of foreigners.
I thought at that time of this week in which the President-Elect of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
In the agenda of the day, as always that meets the leaders of these two countries, it consisted: immigration, drugs and commerce.
Rock Grandson was wishing to also speak of the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons by which at the moment it is so probable that a Mexican remains in Mexico because he is ventured to go to the United States.
It wants to be associated with the United States and Canada and to create in North America a commercial block in the style of the European Union.
In addition, Rock Grandson promised to continue fighting against the cartels of the drug in Mexico, although it did not give details.
For Mexico, the relation with the United States is complicated and is full of resentment.
Probably the majority of Americans never remembers that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced their leaders to yield half from their territory to pistol end.
But for the Mexicans, that thinks about centuries, not in minutes, the elements that remember it are throughout.
So, at the moment at which a civil servant of the United States says any thing that entails the minimum critic to Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, as much in the press as between the elite Mexican, on how the Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Moctezuma put themselves still on military.
And even so, for Mexico, the relation that really supposes everything a challenge is the one that they have with more than 35 million Mexican-Americans who live in the United States.
We speak of resentment?
There is much.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not thus.
The only reason for which there are so many people of Mexican ancestry living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, in some point of our genealogical tree, there was a person, perhaps the father or the mother or some of the grandparents, to whom the door of the opportunities at Mexico was closed to him and had to march towards the north.
And the majority of the times that one person fitted in a certain profile: skin dark, a low level of studies, coming from a poor town, etc.
We are their descendent ones and we are to them loyal.
To Mexico no.
And perhaps, although we are living now the American dream, to the salary gone to good schools and had salary good works, we cannot never lose of view that what we are living are that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty yes that is it.
It is for the United States.
In addition, we are conscious that to many of Mexican pertaining to the elite of the class the leader they did not like.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and looks to us over the shoulder as if we were of a category inferior that is not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish never will be sufficiently good and our bows with Mexico never will be sufficiently strong.
To its way to see, our existence is synonymous of failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone away.
And now we would not be catched after this curtain of silk, living well in the United States but, even so, like solitary souls.
My woman, that was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a girl, remembers me that this rubbing between the Mexicans exists and the Mexican-Americans because first they know with more solidity who are and to the seconds this bothers to them.
Although she is citizen of the United States, she considers part of countries both.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans who I know feel that they are not part of neither.
It enchants to us to listen to the Mexican group the Tigers of the North, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best thing of each country, but you are not ingrained to any of them.
In Mexico they see us like Americans.
And in the United States us it is considered Mexican.
Now, to complicate the things still more, reason why I have found out during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to return to connect with the diaspora.
They want that the Mexican-Americans work like “improvised ambassadors” of Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We would say to our American companions the fantastic thing who are to visit that country and we would press the political leaders so that they reinforced its bows with Mexico.
Yes, clearly…
That is not going to happen.
There is too much resentment.
And, with the inequality of wages, the galloping corruption and the violence by drugs, many of us we are not so safe that it is a fantastic country.
I am afraid that you are going away to be single with this idea, friendly.
It is just.
If some Mexicans not yet are preparations to pardon to the United States by the form in which they tried to Mexico an average century ago and, then they must accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans still are suffered by how she treated his relatives does very many less time.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are more “Mexican” than it thought.
Old battles, the new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamás could well be a little probable base for La Paz
It will be able someday to have a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the middle of the useless and habitual discussions on whom it began first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubbish; more than 140 Palestinians, the majority of civil them, and six Israelis they have been assassinated and, for the first time, missiles coming from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the city santa of Jerusalem.
But, although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, all whatever surrounds in the Middle East is changing to them.
The Arab spring they have left to all fact pieces it likes or no, Palestinian and Israeli they have been catched in the regional uproar.
Perhaps this causes that their fight is still more bloody that before.
Nevertheless, reasons exist to think that its lethal situation of deadlock could refloat.
A war that neither is lost nor gained
At first sight, the optimism at the moment seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the cease-fire decided the 21 November stays, the confrontations of this week have reinforced the hawks of both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the movement islamist that has governed Gaza from 2007, will affirm to have forced the Israelis to retire, although Gaza has received a good beating.
And in spite of to have killed to some of its leaders and to have put under pressure to the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable corners and towns of the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas are taking terrain in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine at the moment governed by its implacable rivals of Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, the leaders of Hamas could reach the conclusion that the time plays its favor.
Since the islamists have been gaining influence by everybody Arab, Hamas have made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that previously had been the Muslim ally nearer Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Also Qatar has done it, one of the richest and dynamic states of the Gulf.
The elated members of Hamas say that the average moon islamist is surrounding Israel, from the Lebanon to the north, where it dominates the Hizbulá party-militia, happening through Syria, where the rebels of a tendency more and more islamist could overthrow Bashar Assad, until arriving at Jordan, where the allies of Hamas are threatening the king.
Mainly in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brothers directed by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, with difference the most populated and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, tyrant the lay one who governed in Egypt during 30 years until its fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
However, the Muslim Brothers are prime brothers of Hamas and their leaders depend more on the popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas arise like protagonist whom cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, the hard wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.
As regards the military question, they have put to Hamas in its site.
The system anti-missile Iron Dome of Israel has demonstrated its effectiveness and many of the missiles of Hamas have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep calmer… during some time.
As far as the diplomacy, the United States is firmer than ever; many European countries also blamed to Hamas of to have initiated the last big wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjamín Netanyahu, prime minister who has ignored widely the peace process.
Although the rockets shot from Gaza have ended the life of about 30 Israelis from 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, partly thanks to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of a suction territory to become state of Palestine, and protects the Jewish establishments that continue increasing although, according to the international legislation, they are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has been united to a group of a line still more lasts led by Avigdor Lieberman in the previous period to the elections the 22 of January, is in a good position.
Why to pamper to those Palestinian doublings giving an own state them?
If they really governed in the West Bank, they wouldn't shoot rockets as their compatriots in Gaza have done?
He is better to have them after that wall and to give a good blow them if they raise the head.
Perhaps the hard wing prevails, although the Arab spring could alter its calculations.
Although the islamists that take the power in Egypt and other sites do not have too much esteem to Israel, their priority will be to approach the internal difficulties.
The budget of defense of Israel is major that the one of its four together Arab neighbors.
To initiate a war with the superpower of the zone hardly will help to the new Arab governments to improve its economies.
That pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to obtain the cease-fire is a good augury and could mark the beginning of something.
Also the Israelis would have to think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, to prevail to the Palestinians of its right to the self-determination it supposes to create a powder magazine that a day will explode in the territories occupied by Israel, of the same form that this week operated a bus in Tel Aviv.
The repression already is mining the democracy in the Jewish state and the demography makes worse the situation as it increases the Arab population.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject to Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push people other people's to the conflict.
The solution continues being the one that announces sensible people of both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the cession of territory on the part of Israel for reasons of security.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the cease-fire gives a little more impulse to the other people's people who are fighting by this cause.
Egypt, that must begin to put brake to the entrance of arms in Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in a situation without precedents to convince to Hamas that it accepts the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with interchanges of earth and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs other people's to the subject also would have to press to Hamás and Fatah so that they are united.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state that the imminent attempt to obtain a category of virtual state in the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important paper concerning to be able to take to Israel to the negotiation table.
During his first term it omitted to present his own plan for La Paz.
Again in the White House, it seems equal of reticent dedicating its attention to him.
This attitude supposes a deplorable vision de futuro.
The stable Middle East is of vital interest for the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The law of generic tobacco packaging enters Australia in force
Warnings on the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases shine on small boxes of a dull green color, that are the same for all the brands of tobacco
The Australian in the matter of tobacco and generic packaging, pioneering law the world in force, enters and replacing logos and the colors of the brands by a package of extinguished a green olive, some frightful images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of children and ill babies for being children of parents smokers.
With the exception of the different images and sanitary warnings, the only difference between the small boxes, obligatory from Saturday, is the names of the brands, all of them forms in a small type of source.
One is the strictest regime of the world applied to the tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia affirms that the objective is to dissuade the young people to smoke by means of the elimination of the characteristics that cause that this habit has glamor.
It trusts studies that demonstrate that if a person has not begun to smoke before the 26 years, a 99% of possibilities that exist never it does it.
“It is possible to be seen that the children, even from very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand”, it affirmed minister of federal Health, Tanya Plibersek, mentioning studies that showed, for example, how the children related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia counts on one of the lower rates of smokers of the world and that these changes will not affect too much to the benefits of the multinationals, other countries are whereas clause to take similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted an enormous pressure against the law.
The tobacco companies affirmed that the law would foment the black tobacco market, in which the cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
“The legislation it will cause serious involuntary consequences”, said Scott McIntyre, of British American Tobacco, in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that will bring the falsifiers of China and Indonesia to sell it in the streets of Australia.
Other people say that its business has benefitted after the approval of the law.
Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a familiar small business, affirmed that the demand of cigarette cases and covers of silicone to cover the disagreeable images of the small boxes had gone off almost from zero two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a rejection to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
The Mrs Has affirmed that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and that it was waiting for more existence.
“For us it is a good business”.
According to the experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of the social networks enters the demographic sector which goes the plan.
After a series of Australian laws that prohibit the publicity in the television and the sponsorship of sports and that force to the majority of salesmen not to put cigarettes in view, the marketing of the tobacco has happened to be realised in line.
Australia has prohibited the publicity in Internet to companies and local webpages, but it cannot restrict it in foreign pages.
“If you commercialize tobacco and only you have left this small window to promote your products, the space in line is the most convincing place in the one than to be”, said to Becky Freeman, investigator of public health of the University of Sydney.
Freeman observed an increase of reviews on brands coming from “citizens of on foot” published in webpages of social networks like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It is possible to ask itself if one is only a deprived citizen to whom really the Marlboro cigarettes enchant to him and the annoyance has been taken to realise a video or if some company of marketing is behind all this.
The British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry concentrates more in which implies the new norm that in marketing.
The industry has gotten to even pay so that the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic challenge the new norms; these countries are affirming before the World Trade Organisation who is restricting the commerce unjustly, although no of these countries has a volume of significant commerce with Australia.
It is probable that the WTO dictates a resolution in the middle of 2013.
Plibersek affirmed that the government had maintained conversations with other countries that are whereas clause to apply similar laws in the matter of tobacco packaging.
In 2001 Canada became the first country that introduced the obligatory nature to include images in the small boxes.
At the moment they are obligatory in more than 40 countries, between which are Brazil, Turkey and the Ukraine.
In Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India are whereas clause to apply harder laws.
In Australia many smokers are challenging.
“The photographies do not affect to me.
Simply I do not do case to them”.
“You take to the cigarette and guards the package”, says Victor El Hage while he buys a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth.
“Sincerely, only there is a reason for which it would stop smoking: by my daughter.”
James Yu, manager of the King tobacconist of the Pack in center of Sydney, indicates that the uniform small boxes cause that turns out to him more complicated to place them in the bookcases.
“Normally one hour in desenvalar a delivery took; now I take four”, affirms Yu.
“The government must totally have prohibited the tobacco and then, already he is, he is worth, he finished and we closed the store”, he says while he raises the hands upwards.
In a world constantly connected, he is not so bad to become bored a little
During the celebrations of the Thanksgiving day of this year, of unexpected form I had to spend five hours in an airport because the airplane in which we flew underwent a mechanical problem and we had to hope at that another airplane arrived.
So I had very many time to think about the boredom.
I am not going to you to lie.
To go noon in an airport being hoped to that it arrives a flight is quite boring, even if you have means to be entertained, like books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the stores duty-free to us.
But every time it has more academic and expert developing infantile that praises kindness of the boredom.
According to them, it is well that, as much we as our children, become bored from time to time.
To become bored forces to the brain to look for interesting options and perhaps it foments the creativity.
Since, at the moment, the majority of us we are connected to this or that one screen, we did not undergo the benefits that the boredom contributes.
So, we would have to accept of good spirit the boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But, already we will speak of it more ahead.
First of all, like much people, supposed that, now we have more time to the leisure, the boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as he affirms Peter Toohey, university professor of Greek and Roman History of the University of Calgary, in Canada, and author of the book “Boredom: To Lively History” (“the boredom, an animated history”) published in 2011 by Yale University Press, he is not thus.
“In fact, the history of the boredom is very extensive”, it affirms.
In the walls of Pompei graffittis in Latin exist on the boredom that date from century I d.C.
Also we must consider how we defined the boredom.
“The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed of very diverse ways”, indicates John D. Eastwood, professor of Psychology of the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published investigations and raising the idea before a trained group of discussion percent people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the boredom like the experience “to wish, but not to be able, to participate in an activity that fills to you”.
It affirms that the difference between the boredom and the apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
It indicates that with the apathy desire does not exist to do something.
The main experience of the boredom, affirms, is “the alteration of the process of attention, associated to a low mood and a sensation of which the time happens slowly”.
The boredom can sound terribly similar to the depression.
Nevertheless, Professor Eastwood says that, although they can be related, the people who are boring lie down to see the problem like a question of the surroundings or the world, whereas the people who are depressed consider that the problem they have it.
Sometimes we think that we are boring, when what happens to us in fact is that we have problems to concentrate to us.
In its study “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention”, published in the edition of September of the Perspectives magazine on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues was sent to a previous experiment in which the participants listened to a tape of a person who read the article of a magazine.
Some groups listened to in the contiguous room a program of television all volume that did not have any relation, others listened to it with the low volume, so that he was hardly perceivable, whereas the third group did not listen to the audio one at any moment.
The group that listened to the program with the volume under showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost to them to concentrate itself, but they were not safe of why and they attributed it to the boredom.
“When you try to concentrate itself in a difficult or interesting task, the alteration of the attention can take to the boredom”, indicated Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neuroscience of University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
“On the other hand, when you are doing something boring, like detecting defective pieces in a line of manufacture, a music that distracts you to you can help not to bore to you”.
“In fact, at the moment we know that to move or to make pothooks, actions that often are interpreted as boredom sign, can in fact help to fight it, since they cause that person is physically more alert”.
“The investigations demonstrate that those children to whom is allowed them to move learn more and retain more information than those to which it is commited to them to be quiet”, affirm Professor Fenske.
All we know what is to become bored at some time: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, a especially boring film.
But some people have more tendency to become bored that others.
In order to help to measure it, some investigators developed in 80 years a “scale of tendency to the boredom”.
The scale includes questions like “many of the things that I must do are repetitive and monotonous” and “there are so many things that interest to me that I do not have time to do it everything”.
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of Psychology of the University of West Florida, affirms that, using these scales, the investigators are shortage that the boys have more tendency to more often become bored than the girls, and concretely need more varied external stimulation and more.
But, generally, the adolescents are a type of group that becomes bored enough with facility.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and communitarian Development of the University of Illinois, took to end an experiment in which he made contact with 400 adolescents and with his parents between seven and eight times to the day by means of he looks for.
It discovered that the 32 percent of the adolescents said that it became bored while it was in the school or making the duties, whereas the 23 percent said that it became bored when it was not in the school.
On the other hand, the 3 percent of the parents said that they became bored.
Professor Larson said that he did not know if the present percentage of boredom, 21 years later, would be superiors or inferiors.
But it said that what yes knew era that “the adolescence is a period in which the boredom reaches its higher levels”, to a large extent because as much to the children as to the adolescents a great control does not occur them exceeds what they want to do.
So, returning it asks of the principle: it is good for becoming bored?
Sometimes it is not it, since, taken to the end, it can cause that we expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, since to make bets or to fall in the consumption of substances like method to fight it, as they demonstrate the investigations.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak of the connection between the boredom and the creativity, according to affirms Professor Vodanovich, that there is studying this question for more than two decades.
“The boredom is the way that has the brain to say to you that you would have to be making another thing”, Gary Marcus, professor of Psychology of the University of New York says.
But the brain not always knows what is most appropriate.
If you are boring and you use that energy to touch the guitar or to cook, that will satisfy you.
But you watch, is possible that it satisfies you in the short term, but not in the long term.
“So, if your son is boring and it give iPad him, it is possible that no longer one becomes bored, but will not have learned to entertain themselves by itself or to dose themselves”, affirms Professor Fenske.
And “that capacity to dose itself is applied to other situations”, it indicates.
Your son not only learns to entertain himself by itself, but he learns to control itself better in other areas.
I do not believe that really we want to praise the boredom.
But we would not have either to be too much critics with him.
Our objective would have to be, rather, the one to feel us comfortable sections of the constant rumor of the activities and the technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“To our way to see, we needed to become bored more, but the boredom is a too distressing and disquieting desire like relating it to which is worth the trouble”, it affirms.
She indicates that what people really look for is a way to disconnect and to enjoy an idling.
“In surroundings in which constantly we are sobrestimulated”, it affirms, “is difficult to find forms to center our attention when the noise stops”.
Colorado: without book of instructions for the new law on the marijuana consumption
Anthony Orozco, student of 19 years in a communitarian institute and soccer player of the Southeast of Colorado, face a penal process by which soon he will be legal in all the state: the possession of some stones of marijuana and a pipe that used to smoke it.
Orozco says that a day of September, he and some friendly lead by Lamar, in the plains near the border of Kansas, when the police stopped them.
The police found marijuana in the car and a time later Orozco received a judicial citation by possession of drugs and related articles (misdemeanors than entail a each fine of 100 dollars American) in which inquired to him into the date of the judgment.
“They try to Us like a criminal”, says Orozco.
And they are it?
In the weeks of uncertainty following to the voting that took place in Colorado for the legalization of the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of smaller causes by drug possession less than depends the law than on the location.
Hundreds of misdemeanors by marijuana possession are being annulled as much here as in the state of Washington, where a similar measurement was approved.
The police departments have stopped presenting positions against the majors of 21 years by possession on small scale, that will be approved once the law legally has entered in force the next weeks.
But the public prosecutors of more preservative districts of Colorado have themselves it jeopardize to follow ahead with the cases opened by marijuana possession and still they are mentioning people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to western mountains, are voting to prevent recently that marijuana stores are opened, authorized, in their communities.
“All this is changing so quickly that I do not know what will be the following thing”, Daniel J. Oates, head of police in Aurora, right said to the east of Denver.
Who are also in charge of the regulations in the state of Washington they are giving him returned to the subject.
And they continue looking for advising to establish a system of licenses of production, manufacture, distribution and sale; all this before limit arrives the date, the 1 of December of 2013.
They say that, for or or evil, Colorado it goes in front of the majority of the states as far as the regulation of the use of the marijuana, first with therapeutic aims and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has more a regulated market, so she will be a good guide”, it affirms Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Commission of control of the alcohol of the state of Washington.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system only can make suggestions exceeds what could work.
“A true precedent does not exist that serves to us as model”, it affirms.
The law of Washington, denominated I-502, enters the 6 of December in force, which also leaves a year during which it will be swum between two waters, since the system of licenses in that state not yet will exist, but the possession will be legal.
In addition, some delicate mechanical questions exist that must be solved during that period, as the way to maintain a balance between the exigency of the state to offer a “adapted access” to the authorized marijuana and its prohibition to realise cannabis businesses in a radius inferior to 300 meters of schools, parks, infantile zones of game or infantile centers.
“In no place it will be more difficult to locate a business of authorized cannabis that in the urban zones, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle”, says Ben Livingston, spokesman of the Center for the legal cannabis, a group of investigation created recently.
The 21 of November, Oates, the head of police of Aurora, sent an e-mail to its policemen in which it informed to them into which the public prosecutor of the city would stop interposing legal actions by minor offenses by possession of marijuana to adults of 21 years and into that the police would stop presenting positions against those crimes “with immediate effect”.
The head of Oates police said that they would be in charge to make fulfill the norm of the city that regulates the culture of marijuana with therapeutic aims and that would continue persecuting dealers and salesmen of drug.
In the county of Weld, in the north of Colorado, the public prosecutor of the district, Ken Buck, it represents a stricter vision.
After the voting, it assured that its office would continue persecuting the cases of marijuana possession, mainly to press the consumers and who are decided to receive treatment.
At the moment, 119 people less than face positions by possession of 56 grams or marijuana, although many of them have other positions.
“Our office has the obligation to interpose legal actions against those lack that at the moment in which they took place were crime”, Mr. Buck in a declaration said.
The answer has been complicated even in places like the table rural county, where the voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of the marijuana.
The police of Grand Junction, the greater city of the county, no longer mentions to adults by possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, public prosecutor of the district of the county, supported this decision, but also he decided not to misestimate no of the pending cases by possession.
“I do not consider that it is wasting the time when continuing enforcing the law until this one changes”, it affirmed.
Although the 55 percent of the voters supported the measurement, it was never considered that to take the consumption of marijuana for recreational use to the sine of the government and the judicial system it went to being easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise by all the state show a noticeable ambivalence between the civil servants with respect to the great ecological experiment in this state.
“One is a cultural barrier with the public prosecutors of the district”, affirms Sean McAllister, a lawyer of Denver that represents the defendant by marijuana possession and that is local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reformation of the law on the marijuana.
“They have spent as much time taking to people before the courts who, in fact, still cannot accept that he is legal”, affirmed.
To the being the first states that in the same way consider the amounts small of marijuana that if outside alcohol, Colorado and the Washingtons are prepared to become the cases of test at national level as far as the drug legalization.
While lawyers and civil servants of the state count on a new border of legal sales, they also hope anxious to receive indications of the federal government, who still anticipates the consideration of the sale and the culture of marijuana like federal crimes.
The defenders of the legalization of the marijuana have the hope of which the Department of justice bristle.
Although some outstanding arrests of patients and salesmen of marijuana for therapeutic aims have taken place, the federal government has allowed in his majority that exist businesses of sale of marijuana with these aims in Colorado, Washington and 16 states more.
“Although it is probable that the agents antidrug do not throw doors down to confiscate a small drug stock market, probably they will be obstinate to allow the operation of stores regulated by the state for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, allowed in the new law”, said to Kevin A. Sabet, a exasesor of antidrug policy of the administration of Obama.
Several cities of Colorado do not hope to that the federal authorities act.
Even before the day of the elections, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new store of marijuana, although he will happen around a year before anyone of them can open.
The last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a prohibition of six months and is probable that the week approves it that comes.
“We do not want to put us in a situation in which we authorize to somebody and soon we have a serious problem at federal level”, it explained Bob Nicholson, member of the city council.
“Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favor of which the community against voting voted in favor of which the state voted.”
Many questions arise on the matter.
Petronella Wyatt: “They harassed to Me until throwing to me of Oxford for being a Tory”
It is not only attacked the college students by his points of view now
Nonmemory no moment in my life in which it does not have been dreaming in securing a place in the University of Oxford.
As much my father as my older brother had been in whom I supposed I was the best place of the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fomented pillars of the civilization both: the free thought and the tolerance.
Nevertheless, to the two weeks to occupy my place in the Worcester College at the end of years 80 to attend the race of History, already it had made the suitcases, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and he lay down to cry.
My friendly were disturbed.
The newspaper The Evening Standard affirmed that I had left because she did not tolerate that some companions of university maintained sexual relations in the room of alongside.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced joking who had gone to me because they forced to me to drink in chipped cups.
The truth was less funny.
I fled from there.
Yes, I fled, because been it had put under systematic a harassment and intimidation.
Not due to my outlandish name, nor to the fact that it came from a private school.
They harassed me for an only reason, that in the cradle of the supposed illustration was something intolerant and Barbarian: my father, the deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was an advisory outstanding of Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative Party.
Perhaps they are asked what that comes now.
, Several information indicate well that a new generation of right center students is undergoing a similar persecution.
Institutionalized and increasing hatred towards the students of the Conservative Party is so in Oxfords that, the last week, a group of them demanded the same level of equality of rights that have the homosexuals, disabled and the ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (grouping of degree students) of the Christi College Corpus affirm that “they are often seriously separated, personally attacked and tried like nonpleasing people” by his political ideas.
They want to create a position in the committee of equal opportunity of its university school to make sure being able to express its opinions freely.
Its situation was not favored by recent a documentary one of the called BBC2 “Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right” (the paradise: young people, brilliants and of rights) on the policy of the students and that presented to the Tories like eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It showed the student of postgraduate course Joe Cooke, ex-president of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Oxford (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, shining a silver-plated suit and a cane with the silver grip.
In other universities, the preservative students say that she treats to them more like “Turk heads” by the introduction of lifted rates of matriculation.
Luke Black, of 20 years and vice-president of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, declared in a dominical newspaper that “exists an increasing tendency of lefts in the universities.
People assume that we are like the Bullingdon Club without nor so at least knowing us”.
Samuel Roberts, of 21 years and student of history in Corpus Christi that presented the motion for a greater protection, affirms that this atmosphere is “uncomfortable”, whereas Stephanie Cherill, of 19 years and elect president of the OUCA, affirms that the attitude of the members of the JCR towards the people which they are of right center has gotten worse.
“This supposes a threat for the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as for the well-being of the members”, it affirms.
During my first weeks in Oxford I was single than the one.
I entered the university in September of 1986, was a terribly timid young person of 18 years.
Hatred towards the Conservative Party was in its higher point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, old student, “an honorary” title after cuts in the financing of the Education Superior.
The atmosphere would have made shake of fright to any Stalinist.
During the first days of the week of welcome to the new college students, when the new students know themselves and know the university professors, I already received a sample of the bitterness that hoped to me.
I discovered that the university professors not only made the fat view before the mockery that became of the preservative college students, but participated willingly in her.
The policy of the strike of the miners, the privatization and the opposition from the government to the sanctions against the apartheid in South Africa arrived until the rooms of wood of the seminary.
To first that I attended they were due to translate to English French texts of century XVIII and I was not prepared so she came next.
“Young lady Wyatt”, said university professor Harry Pitt (already passed away), “please, translates the first paragraph”.
I did not give nor one.
Pitt, a man verily low with a face that seemed mass of sponge cake, knew well how to expel bad bile.
“It is that the thatcheristas refuse to learn French or is that, simply, they are idiot? ”, it asked.
The other college students laughed themselves.
The eyes burned to me with the tears that tried to contain.
“I suggest to Him goes to French classes in its free time, as long as too much he is not occupied knowing people”, Pitt groaned.
I returned room like a soul in pain.
That one night I sat down single at the time of dinner in the university; then I felt a slight pat in the back.
She was an English student of second called year James who appeared like member of the OUCA.
“I know the one who you are”, it said to me amiably.
“I am afraid that thus it is as goes the thing.
They put with whatever suspect of being Tory.
For me he is very complicated, but they know that your father is near Margaret Thatcher, so for you he will be still worse.
Many Tories just arrived to pretend to be Labour Party members”.
More ahead, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to disguise.
I insisted on which it was not in agreement with everything what Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick was useless.
A student of first year of Philosophy, Policies and Economy that, paradoxicalally, had studied in Eton, said: “You are daughter of a facist pig.
You are contaminated”.
Other students adopted that cancioncilla.
I became the dirty one perverted.
“How have sexual do relations the Tories? ”, asked one.
“They occur to a beating the one to the other, no”
I felt in the same way that they must have felt the homosexuals before the liberal law of years 60.
It could someday take a normal life in Oxford?
See would I forced to have left with people who thought like I only after the dusk?
It would have to do Labour Party member to me and to repress my natural tendencies?
The three years that hoped to me appeared like an isolation and ostracism purgatory of.
The only university professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History destined university school.
They hated to him for being not only of the Conservative Party, but also adviser of Thatcher in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote their speeches to him.
It hardly was that way.
It detested the place so that provincial considered it and insignificant and by its adhesion to the vision Marxist-determinist of history.
In 1997 it accepted a chair in the University of Bilkent, in Ankara, Turkey.
“Here you are not going to be happy”, said to me.
I began to daily move from Oxford to house of my parents in London, finding refuge in my relatives and friendly of opened metropolitan mentality more.
I said father to him who hated Oxford and why.
It did not believe to me.
When it studied there in years 40, all the political points of view were accepted.
“But it is the best place of the world”, it said with sadness.
“They never would do that, not there between my dear needles of dream.
Until my communist friendly always they had an impeccable attitude”.
Their sore eyes began to become cloudy.
“Give another opportunity him.
I am sure that they have made it to only joke.
The heart would be divided to me if you left it.”
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was being deteriorated.
A friend mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to the pressure and had resigned to his creed.
The following week, during a seminary in which another university professor of History had insinuated, speaking totally in serious, that I was a “enemy of the town”, I decided to do the same.
Red of shame on the inside, I admitted that my parents “had washed the brain to me” and I called to them “old stupid”.
The truce lasted just a short time.
He was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my university race in Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in the press of Murdoch.
My door was closed with key.
I inside was curled up of fear and, spent five minutes, my pursuers stopped.
When they went away I made the suitcase and I took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Perhaps you call to me weak weeping.
But no person of 18 years would have turns put under such level of intimidation and hostility in an educative institution.
What is still more tragic is that was Oxford, that not only has formed to 14 prime minister of the Conservative Party but, to day of today, nothing deserved of equality and freedom of thought hides after a reputation.
“Valentino prefers the elegance to the notoriety”
On the occasion of the sample “Valentino: Teacher of the Seam”, that has been inaugurated this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, famous Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and another clientas of the Italian designer
Somerset House, old residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy to welcome a exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of “Valentino: Teacher of the Seam”, tremendous a retrospective one that reunites more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his “maison” during last the 50 years.
“I adore this palace”, it says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the finishing touch of a history whose only protagonist is “il signore” Garavani, but that could not be written without his distinguished clientas.
Valentino always has felt fascination by the rarefied and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, opened until next the 3 of March, private letters and photos with the most seeded signature with of the aristocracy abound, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, happening through Princess Marie-Chantal de Grecia and Margarita de Inglaterra.
Valentino teaches those personal memories like trophies of its social ascent: of humble couturier of the city of Voghera, in the north of Italy, to idol of the “jet-set” international.
To be enamored with the royalty does not have anything of bad.
“They At least do not extinguish the butts of their smokes on your magnificent carpet since they make some beautiful celebrities of music MGP”, the baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza says.
In years 60 and 70, both we lived in friendly the Alps and good éramos.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
“To all it enchanted us to be invited to its villa in Gstaad”, explains exmujer of “Heini” Thyssen, intimate of beauties forgotten like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino always has preferred the elegance to the notoriety.
And even so, it is a star.
Valeria Mazza, shining a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza either does not forget the charisma the couturier.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza I gave Spagna, in Rome, we went to have dinner to its floor.
Éramos twenty people, between whom they were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In each detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, music, in everything was seen and his spirit felt.
“To each one of the guests it made us feel important and beloveds”, remembers the “top model”, that began to work with him during the Week of Haute couture of Paris, in 1995.
“It never happens fashionable because their designs are art works”, it ends.
Parade of lineage
The life of Garavani is not a history of obsessions, but of corresponded loves good.
It loves people with good education and better titles, and they love to him him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamurosa footbridge of sixty meters in length that proposes a change of rolls: the visitor takes the place from the models and must march past by the footbridge to contemplate to a “hearing” of dream that shines masterpieces of Valentino, like the dress that chose Jackie Kennedy for its wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the clothes who used Monica Vitti in “the Notte”, or a coat of wool and skin that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In that public of dummies names like the one of Sibilla de Luxemburgo shine, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Noruega, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sofía de Habsburgo.
Naty Abascal and the couturier, in 2006
Many of those clientas say that the first Valentino is like the first love, “impossible to forget”.
The memory perfectly.
It was trousers, a shirt, a vest “gillette” and a jacket of the collection autumn-winter 1971-1972.
“It was a gift that to me he did”, he says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
“I prefer It to him over others by his femininity, by his great love to the women, because it heightens our beauty”, it adds the ex- duchess of Fair.
I like much the colors that use, have great light and are “donors” to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashionable prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time that a Valentino dressed.
When he was adolescent and it lived in Italy, it dreamed about getting to have the age and the occasion to be able to use one of his evening dresses…
Finally the hour at the end of years 90 arrived.
I bought my first dress of Valentino to use in a celebration in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with skirt of flown, “corsage” draped and decollete honor word.
“It was a dream made reality”, says to the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
“Valentino is indifferent in fashion, its obsession is the eternal thing”, explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her party dresses from the couturier with “the maximum cares… because a dress is not only a dress, also is the set of memories that entails”.
The “king” of the fashion
The great end of the exhibition of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller in its wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months were needed work and 25 “ragazze” (as it calls the couturier to his seamstresses) to make that suit of silk color ivory with incrustations of pearls, twelve different types of embroider and one average tail of four meters and.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, highest authority of the specialized press, that one dress represents a landmark of the haute couture of end of century XX, “the return of clientas of the high society”.
Obnubilado during years with “savoir-être” of the elite, now Valentino is its better unit.
Cavaliere I gave Great Croce (the distinction of more high rank in Italy), Cavaliere of Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre DES Arts ET DES Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates so many honors as anyone of the spouses of his clientas.
“Its refinement, its calm, its clean and perfect aspect has always drawn me attention”, recognizes D'Arenberg.
The last time that I saw was a month ago in a dinner in full dress in the Museum of Orsay.
It was in the table of countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend mine.
“He was impeccable, the time does not happen for him”.
If a princess says it…
The office lasts more of the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
By four Euros, the porteadores of the Indonesian volcano gamble the life and the health loading 70 kilos of sulphur through lofty stone footpaths
There is people for whom its work is a hell and other than, literally, works in hell.
It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who gain the life removing sulphur from volcano Kawah Ijen, to the east of the Indonesia island of Java.
For it, it must lower every day until the bottom of its crater, where the sulfurous gas that emanates of the Earth entrails is solidified when making contact with the air.
After taking great sulphur rocks, that altogether arrive even though about 70 kilos, it carries them in two baskets of bamboo that it loads on its shoulders through steep stone footpaths.
They are only 250 meters until the top of the volcano, that rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted porteadores take more than 40 minutes in promoting to turtle passage, keeping the balance and measuring with touch their steps not to slip and to fall by the precipice.
They know that any stumble could cost the life to them, as it happened to him to a French tourist who fell headlong years ago by the crags of the Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen gain 5 pennies of Euro by each kilo of sulphur that they extract
Once above, they break through between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, loading fatigosamente the heavy baskets, walk three kilometers until the balance that a mining company has located a little more down, to 1,850 meters of height.
One is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that explodes from 1960 the volcano and, never rather, to his workers, to whom it pays 662 rupees Indonesian (5 pennies of Euro) by each kilo of sulphur.
Soon it sells by 10,000 rupees (83 pennies of Euro) the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is generalized in the daily life and it is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetic, dynamite and until whitening the sugar.
“As the normal thing is to load 70 kilos, we removed some 46,000 rupees (3.8 Euros) in each trip”, explains Anto to us, that usually carries out three daily bearings.
It takes three hours in each and it finishes wet grinding, but they allow him to join 138,000 rupees (11.5 Euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for so cruel effort, is the triple than it would win in the field.
“The wage of the miners is very high here, where the harvesting of the coffee is pleased to 15,000 rupees (1.2 Euros) the day and the half monthly wage is of two million rupees (167 Euros)”, it clarifies the porteador, that before worked like bricklayer in the tourist island of Bali.
There, its pay was of 75,000 rupees (6.2 Euros) to the day and the edge was not so hard, but Anto has returned with its family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a good reason that, in Indonesia, is as forceful as sulphur: “I married with a young person of Bali, where they are Hindu, and I have brought it to Java so that one becomes to the Islam”.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and the eyes by toxic gases are irritated to him
To its 27 years, Anto takes three gambling the skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur already has begun to pass invoice to him in spite of covering the face with a mask and special glasses.
It has asthma, it breathes with difficulty, it coughs constantly and the eyes by the toxic gases are irritated to him that the volcano dismisses.
It is the price that must pay to secure its dream.
“I will work two years more because I want to open a store or to study Spanish or French”, it promises in English than a more acceptable one.
Punished by the life, this likeable and intelligent young person could be tour guide, waiter or receptionist of a hotel, but instead of that does the work of a mule.
Sharing an impure wood cabin with other porteadores, every day to two rises of the dawn because sulphur does not stop flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the shades, low Anto to the crater illuminating itself with a small lantern adhered to its helmet, that the same has bought with its money.
About 400 porteadores load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
In spite of his pingües benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs nor provides any equipment to the porteadores, that work as much by their account and to the weight.
In fact, not even they see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 Euros) of surcharge by camera that, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 Euros), the guards of this natural park receive to the tourists who go to photograph the volcano and their human mules.
“This work is for the beasts and it does not stop the people”, protests Madrusin, a strapping porteador of 42 years that has been in the Kawah Ijen three decades, since it left the school.
Able to rise up to 110 kilos, it assures that it will hold working “everything what can” because needs the money to educate its three children, among 18 and 10 years.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life
Although sulphur burning fire the throat and stings the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and catches to the miners in the thick columns that leave the volcano, are so hard that no complaint to suffer serious diseases further on…, of course, of its habitual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pains in the knees and sores in the shoulders, that have been malformado by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on its back, Unainik already only can load 50 kilos to its 53 years.
Every day, he and its companions takes 15 tons of sulphur to the volcano, that three trucks transfer to the warehouse of Tamansari, to 18 kilometers of distance by a way of goats between the weeds.
“I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life”, the mouth proclaims Unainik opening well, where it needs several teeth.
Of its five children, the major, of 30 years, also works loading sulphur.
The time happens, but the misery perpetuates of generation in generation one of the hardest offices of the world: the one that makes the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore looks for babies to save the economy
The singapurenses blame to the race, the stress and the cost of the properties and the education of not having children.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow”.
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill ours to have civic and we create life!
It can seem improbable that these verses are part of an announcement of mint tablets, but in spite of that - or perhaps due to that - the video became viral earlier this year in YouTube in Singapore.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references as “We are going to put a beam (bun) in the furnace” to laugh itself of the rate of natality of Singapore.
The publicity company that made the video, BBH, lodges the hope of which with the announcement they manage to draw attention on the problem of an funny way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, say that he wanted to use the power of music so that people fulfill “his to have national”.
This is something purely of Internet, so we had to do it funny and graceful.
It is the greater problem in this country.
We are the worse ones of the world in reproducing to us same, so we felt that this era a subject that we had to approach.
We knew that the government had tried many things, as to send perfumes with pheromones or to organize veiled of fast appointments (speed-dating).
Many of those ideas can have been creative, but not necessarily they worked.
So we thought, why we don't do most creative possible to solve this problem, that is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one that the taking so lightly is not the government of Singapore.
It spends US$1.300 to the year in policies to animate to the citizens to have more children.
A package of the government for marriages and parents grants up to 15,000 dollars by boy, extends the licenses by maternity and distributes fiscal benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and of high tech in the Southeast of Asia, also well-known city-state by the conservatism of its leaders and their strict social controls.
The rate of natality of Singapore, in agreement with its national division of population, is placed at the moment in 1,2 children by woman.
The last time that was over 2 - well-known as rate of replacement were in 1976.
So why don't the singapurenses have more children?
So Wei Ming, director of Policies of Marriage and Family of the National Division of Population, say that it is due to one “better education” and “one more ampler range of race opportunities”.
“That has allowed people to have a ampler range of options in terms of objectives of life and priorities, beyond marrying and training a family”, it explains.
These changes in the social norms have contributed to the increase of the single person, and to delay the marriage and the births, which gives like result a diminution of the rate of natality in Singapore.
Meanwhile, a policy of immigration the EU end to increase drastically immigration to do to him against the diminution of the population has created resentment between the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where the disguised xenophobia as soon as against many new immigrants abounds, in particular the Chinese, to whom they criticize to maintain the low wages and not to integrate themselves.
The increase of immigration also is seen like one of the reasons for which the past year the party of government of Singapore underwent its worse election result from independence.
From the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the higher quotas and burdens for the foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
Whereas the fall in the rate of natality has effects known in the economic growth of a nation, the sanitary tax revenues, costs and the policies of immigration, the example of Singapore also is having some unexpected consequences.
The government tries that so many small houses are not constructed.
For example, it has begun to affect to the real estate.
The authority of urban development has happened to control the number of small apartments, known like “box shoes”, that can be constructed in certain zones of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 meters square and have been much successful of sales.
, Is preoccupation of which they can promote a single person lifestyle and discourage to the developers that want to construct great houses, nevertheless familiar.
But Lim Yew Soon, general director of the real estate company the Developers, says that their “boxes of shoes” are sold much more fast that the greatest units.
They are more popular, in the sense that the units run out days, weeks, even faster than the larger units.
This causes that it is far better for our flow of box.
Nevertheless, it admits that the new norms give clearer directions for the developers, to which before introduced ties to them if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much estresados
Singapore is a city-state.
Although these new rules can be a passage towards the increase of the rate of national natality, when speaking with the singapurenses that work in the financial district of the center it seemed that they are not going to have much effect.
“People are very estresada, the houses are expensive and also it is it the education, reason why many people are postponing”, says it a young executive.
Other people can have children.
“But for me it is important to count on my own money and time”, it says to another young person of about 20 years.
Men and women mention their race, the stress and the cost of the properties and the education like the reasons that they prevent them to have children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to push his citizens to have children, when he is to make babies, the singapurenses are the one who have the last word.
Prevailed in off line is private on line
Privacy.
In agreement with the Dictionary of Real Academia Española one is the private quality of or “the scope of the private life that must right to protect of any interference”.
What is private for a minor of 16 years?
How it applies this definition in its daily life and the social networks?
It understands the dangers to which it is exposed to ventilate in Internet situations that surely would not share out of line?
elPeriódico interviewed to five boys among ten and 15 years, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term to “something very mine”, in the personal plane, and “the key and names of the user”, when they applied it to social networks.
“My deeper secrets would not raise them a post”, says Jorge, of ten years, when he tries to explain the meaning of private in sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
“They are secret very secret, my mother can know them, but not everybody”, it affirms.
In FB I raise beautiful images or of games.
Also I entertain myself with my well-known.
“It would not share a photo that is not mine, or of whom it is making the ridiculous situation”, says.
The boy recognizes that he is bad to publish obscene photographies, of naked people, crimes or to write humiliating or violent commentaries.
Jorge assures to know the 35 friendly that have in FB and their nine followers in Twitter.
The majority is relatives.
The mother is including, has the key of one of the accounts.
I opened interesting Twitter to express to me and to write tweets.
“I do not know if they answer to me, I only raise them”, she adds.
“The social networks are entertained, I can speak with distant relatives or my friendly of fast way”, it indicates.
Nondoubt in answering that it would never accept a request of a unknown person.
Nor it would do case to him to which it recommended a stranger to him.
The case of Jose, of 14 years, is different.
The adolescent owns accounts opened in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in this last one admits not to know 20 the added people in his friendly list.
“It does not scare to me, because we have something common, music for example”, it indicates.
According to the boy, no has insinuated nor to him has requested him the direction of its house or its telephone number.
“If they pressed to me or they demanded me simply coat of my account”, it recognizes.
Jose became follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
To the boy the experiences are not to him other people's than today it is known like ciberbullying.
To a well-known of one my friend was extorting it in a social network.
They threatened it and they demanded money to him.
“It never knew who was”, it assures.
The victim, according to Jose, did not close the account.
“It only put privacy to him”.
Soon it explains a series of steps to form the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would raise photos of well-known in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes it would do it, if it falls to me bad or I take desire to him.
“Although I know that is ciberbullying”, it affirms.
Questions nail
Marielos Porras, English teacher of and lawyer in Education and Learning, consider that to orient to the children and the adolescents he must be understood that the intention of the social networks is to inform.
“Internet arose like means to look for information, but with the appearance of these sites they changed the rules of the game”, it mentions.
Clubs indicate that academic Marc Prensky, masters in Pedagogy by the University of Yale and Native author of the work and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The native digitalises are they, the children and young people who were born with the technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who we must teach them, when still we are learning”, he says.
It comments that the subject is complex, “because we are asking to them that has a defined criterion envelope what agrees or not to spread, to publish or to say to an age that the maturity does not give for that”.
“Also that is selective when what matters to them more it is to be popular, to have thousands of friendly without thinking about the consequences”, it adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what is privacy to adolescent children and is through questions that make them reflect.
“To say to them that it does not do it does not serve”, it adds.
Next, Clubs enumerate some options: There are things that you would not tell a stranger, why it beams in Internet?
Or, would you like that they publish a photo of you like whom you published of a friend?
You know what the other publish on you?
When labels photos of celebrations, you asked permission the other people to label them?
And more, do all need to know what you are making every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act on line since they do it in off line.
They are the same rules.
“One outside Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, equal must be in the social networks”, it affirms.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guard, university university professor, primary and consulting professor of educative, comments that it is indispensable who the family parents conscientiously read the policies of the social networks.
When understanding each one of the interjections they have solid foundations to talk with their children on the implications to open an account in Internet.
“For example, the age and what it is allowed to share or to publish”, says.
In agreement with Guard, it turns out key to remember to the children the lesson of “you do not speak with strangers”.
Summit of the Unasur without making public the Declaration finalizes of Lima
The presidential VI Cumbre of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the Declaration became public of Lima, announced previously and theoretically subscribed by the seven attending agent chief executives.
Efe tried in repeated opportunities to accede to the document signed in VI Reunión Ordinaria de Jefes of State and Government of the Unasur, but sources of Chancellery and Presidency indicated at the beginning that they were going it to give after the closing, but later affirmed that at some time it will be published in the Web of the Peruvian Government.
To the being consulted by the text, they indicated that the content had been set out by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during some brief declarations to the press.
The access of the journalists to the information of the Summit was restricted at any moment.
During the day it was only transmitted, in the press room, the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the message “deprived session, audio restricted”.
The little information that circulated between the reporters was given by the spokesmen of press of some of the attending governments of the Unasur to the appointment, although not the Peruvian.
The only document disclosed during the day was the list of attending presidents, which caused the malaise of hundreds of national and international means journalists diverse that requested majors data.
Later, the Presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to means with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it is the uprising of Humala, and not of the official document that closed the summit.
In last October, Peru was the host of III the America Summit of the Arab South-Countries (VANE), and in that occasion, in spite of being required very insistently by the press, Declaration of Lima did not spread also to the call either that previously had announced.
In the official Web of VANE it is possible to be corroborated that the document was published Tuesday the past.
In both international appointments, the Peruvian authorities strived in which there were assured systems of transmission for all the journalists but they limited the obtaining of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a failure of the Court of The Hague that dissolves an border disagreement between both countries.
Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, reunited during appointment regional and ratified that they will respect the decision of (CIJ), that begins Monday in The Hague to listen to the pleas of both parts, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
“We will accept and execute the sentence that defines the differences that nowadays we are taking to this international court”, Humala said, next to its Chilean pair.
“Chile has been, is and is going to continue being a respectful country of the international law, of the peaceful solution of the controversies, treaties and the international courts”, added Piñera, and saluted with a handshake to Humala, next to the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents of which they will be put under the CIJ happened as soon as Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogota by which it had accepted to be put under to the failures of that international court, after a decision on marine limits with Nicaragua that considered seriously erroneous.
The summit was realised with non-appearances of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended of Unasur from 2011 after the destitution of its ex- president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment.
The president host, Ollanta Humala, was the one in charge to open the deliberations in the morning and to close the summit, shortly after the noon of Lima.
The agent chief executive read the final document in which he informed that 16 agreements were adopted and the attachment lines for 31 projects between the South American countries by a total of 17 billions of dollars paid attention to investments.
Between the adopted agreements it mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take “important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship so we are extending the agreements on residence”.
It informed that actions are impelled to improve “the cooperation in the fight against the citizen insecurity and the transnational organized crime, action to make more accessible medecines, the access to cheap Internet in all the corners of South America, and to take care of together and efficient the risks of natural disasters”.
With a Europe in crisis, “the economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have an enthusiastic matrix but it must serve to extend nustra first productive and to glimpse a better future for our towns”, added Humala.
“We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural areas and of borders… uniting to our countries and generating new economic circuits”, the Peruvian president in a read message said.
Between those projects, it mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and estan located in the transverse axes of his territory, from the coast towards Brazil, and two aim at a greater connection with Ecuador, although it did not give to majors details.
Also, the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hoped that the electoral process in that country is used for its restoration to the Union of South American Nations”, of which it is at the moment excluded.
The necessity that Latin America stays like a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and of good relations between neighbors, was another one of the subjects underlinings by the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before initiating his participation in the regional appointment that hoped to meet with its pair of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, Saturday in Mexico to deal with in respectful form the marine disagreement after a failure the CIJ, questioned by Bogota.
“At some future date (Saturday) it is possible that it has an encounter with president Daniel Ortega”, said Santos.
“We are going to review all these ways, are not excluding, including the deal with Nicaragua is going to require a conversation with Nicaragua”, it emphasized.
“With president Ortega I hope to be able to say to him that we handle this of the possible civilized and respectful form more”, it added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would be Saturday in Mexico where they have predicted to attend the taking of control of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, like part of the summit, the ministers of Defense of the block met previously to approve the Plan of Action of the year 2013, that he looks for to fortify the dialogue and the consensus in the matter of Defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the presidency acting of the regional bloc.
“South America must learn of Europe to integrate a citizenship”: Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, affirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case yes, must learn of Europe”.
Strap, that participated in the presidential VI Cumbre of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), celebrated in Lima, declared to the state TV Peru which the European “were killed in World War II” and other conflicts, “but now they are practically a mother country”.
It defended, in that sense, the project to establish the South American citizenship that encourages the Member States of the Unasur.
“It is necessary to secure the free mobility of citizens and workers by any South-American country, as already it happens with the members of the Andean Community, but still there are reactionary sectors that want to give back to us the past”, it warned.
The Ecuadorian president was, in addition, in favor of the resetting of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and to consider to which they have signed the pact of San José on the human rights.
Those that never gives chair are committed to anything and, however, we South-American them signed it everything.
“He is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission of Human rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States”, it affirmed in reference to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Strap assured that he is not sorry of that decision because it has in this way not betrayed his principles, but has respected its “deep democratic values and of human rights”.
It added that, at the time, “there were founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and its process would not be respected”.
It criticized, in addition, to Swedish justice to demand to him that it is put under in its territory the interrogation by a presumed sexual crime when “the own Swedish legislation allows to realise it by means of videoconference, that could be done from the embassy of Ecuador in London”.
Strap affirmed that the risk exists of which the physical and mental health of Assange is deteriorated.
“I have not spoken with him since she is in our embassy, but the ambassador informed that she had a small pulmonary problem, nothing to me burdens”, said the Ecuadorian agent chief executive.
What yes it has is the danger that its physical and mental health is deteriorated to be locked up in a small space without being able to make exercises outdoors.
“That complicates the health of any person”, it added.
Strap indicated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange from June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by means of the concession of salvaconducto that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and emphasized that there have been conversations with London in search of a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We did not negotiate with human rights, that word we did not use it in this case, but there have been permanent conversations.
“The solution of this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and of the European legal authorities because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, is making a series of procedures in different European instances”, he mentioned.
And it thought that “if Great Britain gives to the safe-conduct this tomorrow finishes”.
And if Sweden, as perfectly it allows it his legislation and since it has done in other cases, interrogates to Mr. Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London or it tomorrow interrogates it via Skype finishes this problem.
Strap was useful to reaffirm itself as a defender of the freedom of press and clarified that what does not tolerate is “the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lie, that weaken the freedom of expression”.
“The enemy majors of the freedom of press we are not perverse the evil politicians and but the bad journalists based on the profit, the blackmail and extortion”, it said.
In that aspect it was congratulated that no longer the hegemonic bankers nor countries are these journalists “neither and bourgeois those that dominate to Ecuador”, and advanced that of being reelected “will deepen in the revolution to continue the way and the correct direction”.
Strap also supported the decision to maintain I veto at least to Paraguay in the Unasur until its next elections, when arguing that the organism “must be firm and not to tolerate opportunism and the coup d'etat mentality had with legality” because in fact “destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy”.
The Ecuadorian president considered, in addition, the desire of his homologous Colombian, Juan Manuel Santos “perfectly pertinent”, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the marine limits between both countries after the failure of the Court the International of Justice of The Hague, that benefitted to the Nicaraguan marine sovereignty.
For the moment that failure is not accepted.
It is a problem between a South American country and one Central American.
The conflicts are inevitable, but they must be surpassed by the will to walk together.
It is necessary to process them of ample form to surpass them and to follow ahead.
Also it trusted a good conclusion of the litigation by marine limits that maintain in the same court Peru and Chile and thought that “Latin America is correct to look for international instances if both countries are committed to accept failure by duro that is”.
With reference to the eventuality that appears as candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to look for a third consecutive mandate indicated that it sees that possibility “by far optimism and joy, although sometimes is quite hard”.
Strap assured that if loses the elections of February of the 2013 will retire of the public life.
In the personnel never the power has interested me, but in as unjust situations as the one of Ecuador that socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected from the political power.
“My political movement thought that I was who I guaranteed that probable victory, because we must accept that responsibility”, she said.
to win it would be my last period in the presidency and we left the public life there.
If we lose equal.
“It is a decision”, it affirmed.
Strap also talked about to the new treatment of health of Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I finish speaking with Venezuelan vice-president Nicolás Maduro and it says me that she traveled to a treatment that already was planned, of routine, that hoped that pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
“It does not mean a relapse in the state of health of president Chávez”, it commented.
The Ecuadorian Chief of State today participated in Lima in the VI Cumbre of Chiefs of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that concluded with calls to a greater regional integration to maintain the progress, the equality and the security.
Deaths by AIDS today are cause of delayed detection
Fabrizio had 21 years of age when they confirmed the test results to him: Positive AIDS.
“It was as if a pump fell to me”, it refers when recalling the moment of the announcement, that the doctor tried to make “more suavecito”, without evident success.
The boy hid it to his family.
Position decided to become of its disease and only began to inquire envelope she; with such persistence that already celebrated its birthday 43.
It is, without a doubt, one of the oldest patients of the Unit of HIV of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), at which it arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio lives with the virus of the human immunodeficiency (VIH) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 90, when there was many doubts, few options of treatment and more stigma.
Then, until the director of a clinic of the IMSS it avoided to take leave of him “because it brought one cut”.
Then, to have AIDS was synonymous of death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and to do it with quality of life.
, Nevertheless ignorant from their disease, still many people arrive when the virus already has caused damage, “exhausted” their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
To 31 years of the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, “the great profit means at this moment that the survival of a patient who initiates treatment in opportune form and the survival of the general population, is exactly equal”, indicated the commander of the Unit of HIV of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring that this information was guaranteed in April of this year in a sanctioned scientific publication.
Infectólogo and expert in VIH/sida, Andrade Villanueva commented that from year 2008, the scientists had concluded who AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and the quality of life depend on the degree of affectation to the immune system that present the patients when initiating the diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not usuary of drugs: of up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, the previous thing means that the diagnosis of positive HIV to the 25 years of age receives, under these terms “while it stays in control will be able to live without problems until the 75 years”, explained the interviewed person.
In order to determine the proportions this advance, it is possible to remember that the Mexican life expectancy of the today is of 76 years in average.
Although mortality has lowered significantly in the last years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS under 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (it reports annual of ONUSIDA), also is certain that from the appearance of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients in the national data base have passed away.
Only in Jalisco 255 people passed away in 2011, and go 187 deaths until May of this year; despite one makes sure that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs from 2005.
- Why it continues being deaths?
- it seems to me that the problem is not of access to treatment.
Thus I visualize it, therefore it has happened to us in our hospital.
12 years we have at least in the last not had desabasto of medicine the problem is that the patients arrive very advanced because they, that is to say, do not know his state of infection in delayed stages of the disease.
It gave a forceful data: “Nine of each ten patients arrive when already they present some opportunistic infection what it must make to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, they must offer tests of detection of massive way, to all the people who require it”.
In his proposal agrees specialistic and civil service of Advice State of Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida), also own patients, like Fabrizio, who went to test to a particular laboratory, only motivated because a friend had done it and, in spite of his short age, already was in AIDS stage and she even suffered sarcoma of Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they are going away to die and do not want to know nothing.
“If I am already going away to die, better I burst three times to the week”, they say not in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed to me well, I make exercise, volume medecines.
To the date, their parents only know that he suffered cancer.
Alive a normal life, like anyone.
“Work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsible, I take care of and the other person”, enumerated Fabrizio, who accepted to share his privacy with JALISCO MILLENIUM to motivate today with his testimony those who, within the framework of the Día Mundial of AIDS, they are scared.
That they test, if they had risk, that enters more soon know if they are HIV positive, he is better and if they already have the diagnosis, that learn that they can live like any person, being responsible.
That one, its message, summarizes the motto of battle to AIDS this 2012.
Condoms after the counter
Great they are the hollows that are between the programs of health and the common citizen, maintained Ricardo Salazar, journalist tapatío that has assumed the cause around HIV.
And greatest it is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task “indeed the distribution of condoms has been increased, before gave us of one or two, now give packages us of a one hundred, and that is very well but it is that there are some that today, still, does not have access to a condom”, said.
It enters most vulnerable new infections are the adolescents.
“Why you want them” it is common question, sarcastically and judgments of value of social workers, scholastic advisers, employees of pharmacies and personnel of health, to which they are not wanted to exhibit the adolescents, assured the signaller.
It proposed to reorient this ineffective distribution; that the condoms are not only after the counters and those one hundred public of the sites are in dispatchers of baths that frequent the young people.
It is not to motivate the promiscuity.
Nor one is to pay to them chelas and the motel, as governor Emilio González responded, when asking to him if there would be preservative distribution in its Administration.
“Thus it is not the sexuality, the best thing is to approach the condoms to those who already practice a sexual activity”, it aimed.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13.435 accumulated cases (12.158 of AIDS and 1.317 of HIV).
The S-state 4° national place in cases of new and accumulated AIDS and 13° of HIV.
92% of the contagions correspond to the sexual route, 6% to sanguineous route and 2% to the perinatal route.
Esteem that 50 thousand people can be living with HIV since by a registered case there are of 4 5 people who do not know it.
Ratified by a court of appeals of the United States a sentence that does not know the restructuring of the debt of successful the Vitro Group via a mercantile contest in Mexico, the scene places an ominous precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighboring country that has solution problems.
It would be said, then, that the procedures in endorsement of survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the bars and stars, the wrong way round of international treaties.
In the practical land, the accolade to the emitted sentence 15 of June the last through judge Harlin Hale of the court of Bankruptcies for the North district of Texas, leaves defenseless to the Mexican companies against the possibility of embargo of its properties in beyond Bravo.
Nevertheless, the resolution opens the door to him to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the Supreme Court of the United States, being alleged three inconsistencies.
Of entrance, while the judge of the cause indicates that the creditors must be in force by the Law of Bankruptcies of the United States, the court of appeals of Quinto Circuito, with headquarters in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is the transacted mercantile contest in Mexico.
The first point would imply to not know international the procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with transnational profile.
In fact, towards that aim the Law was created Model of United Nations for the Uniformity of the Commercial law the International, being placed like referee the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the sentence establishes that without the vote intercompanies, recognized in the critical mass of the mercantile contest the debts that had with their matrix the branchs of Vitro, would not have managed the required majority to approve restructuring.
Nevertheless, the possibility the Mexican laws recognize it.
In fact, the one of Vitro has not been the first case in that the scheme is accepted.
There they are average dozen of examples, among them Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts intercompanies guaranteed the Federal Institute of Mercantile Contests.
The certain thing, in addition, is that reducing the votes of the branchs, anyway the creditors of Vitro who fought against this one in Cortes of the United States, that is to say the bottoms “vulture” like Capital Aurelios, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, will not have obtained majority.
The voting would have been of 45 percent against 37.
The data omits it the Court of appeals.
From another angle, this one fault to Vitro of the difficult situation that it faced as of the 2008 I avoid of the serious economic crisis that faced the United States, beating to him the blows to the country.
So far, the signature of the family González Sada will interpose a reconsideration resource before the own court of appeals so that the voting arrives at the plenary session from this one, that is to say the five magistrates, since three only voted.
Of not prospering this one the resource will call to each other of Will assure that it demands the revision of the process on the part of an instance superior, in this case the Supreme Court of Law of the United States.
The serious thing of the case is that the court avoided a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae (“friend of the Court”), in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the frame of the Law of Mercantile Contests is detailed, indicating that this one was relieved with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to tie this one with chapter 15 of the Law of Bankruptcies of the United States.
Still more, it is indicated that the country folded to the principles of the Commission of the United Nations for the International trade, that is to say the rules determined for cross-border cases of insolvency, that they guarantee fairness for indebted and deserving.
Cannon of two bands: they beat to him to Vitro and they beat to him to the country.
General balance sheet
Slept during several months the placed denunciations in the table by the unions of Mexicana de Aviación against exdueño of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, whom blame themselves of fraudulent administration, the Union Association of Aviator Pilots already found the bottle neck.

Héctor “Hetin” Kings: “The basketball has been my life”
Globetrotter of the basketball Héctor “Hetin” Kings was more than 60 years bound to the sport of the floor and, thanks to him, the entire world traveled.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental harvesting of the history of as ample local basketball as she has Héctor “Hetin” Kings.
And it is that before a stroke confined it to a wheelchair in the 2008, Kings were immersed in the sport by more than 60 years, would be like player of smaller categories, player of the Basketball National Superior, empowered and leader in the BSN with the Jeans of Bayamón or president of the Federation of Basketball.
“I put many hats in the basketball through my life, including several to the same time, like when he was president of the BSN, general manager of the National team and federal president during years 90”, it remembered Kings during a visit of First Hour to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife by more than 50 years.
“The basketball has been my life”.
Kings do not exaggerate when doing that asseveration.
The walls of their house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilias that denotes their ample trajectory, therefore testify it.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all, those that hoard with greater emotion are those than they recall his passage by the Jeans from mid the decade of the 50 like player until 1982, when it turned 15 years acting like seize or empowered of the tax exemption.
“Those were my better years, those than I enjoyed myself because I had the opportunity of being part of eight championships of the Jeans from 1967, or would be more like proxy, seized or leader.
They were many years of satisfactions, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And soon I took leave with one to the 1981, the year of debut of Jerome Mincy in the BSN.
in future position was made there “Cuckoo” Ortiz, who was a great administrator”, indicated Kings.
Memory that Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was in the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: “I have a good player hard to You, of stature 6 " 7”.
You want it”
And that was the principle of Mincy, one of the best players than it has had Puerto Rico.
Bartow soon recommended the sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativizado and was one of our better gunners.
Memory that said if Mincy had given a championship him to Bayamon, Gausse would help to bring another one more.
The championship of the Jeans with Gausse enjoyed it, but or to the distance, because for 1988 or it appeared of federal big shot.
For that time it preferred to enjoy his executory and those of Mincy in the National team.
Memory when we won to him for the first time to the United States during the Olympic qualification in Mexico of 1989.
Soon 1990 came World-wide from, where we arrived fourth place and must have been bronze but for that one Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, said Reyes.
Is that group of the World-wide one of 1990 the best National team than you have seen?
It is between the best ones, just as the one than it gained to the Dream Team to him in the Olympic Games of 2004.
But my favorite was the one of the Pan-American ones in Cuba in 1991, when we gained gold and we gave one him peels to the equipment of the United States, that was quite similar to that it gained the bronze to us in the world-wide one.
That one equipment not only repeated to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and “Piculín” (Ortiz), but also had a (Javier) “Toñito” young Columbus and James Carter, to the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and to Mario “Quijote” Morales, who could not have been in the 90 due to an injury in the knee.
An equipment that was not perhaps the best one in terms of personnel, but gave a gold medal us and a great joy was the one of the Olympic qualification of the 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players of roll like “Canito” Snows, Pablo Alicea and a youthful Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the mess of the Pan-American one of Mar del Plata, we gained gold against all the prognoses.
Which has been the best player of Puerto Rico?
Doubtless, that has been Piculín Ortiz.
Their numbers concerning international matches are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level since Piculín did it.
And that without counting its trajectory in the different leagues that played.
Who has been the best Puerto Rican leader?
That is very difficult.
We have had a very good litter that it includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young people, I like much the work of Leo Arill.
Which you consider your greater profit in the federation?
To have been part of the most glorious era of the National team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the 90 beginnings of the BSN had up to 17 equipment in one season.
What you had left to do?
There were things that had wanted to implement, like the regionalisation of the smaller categories.
For example, that the boys of Ponce only played in their area and they would only face equipment of other corners of the Island in the play - offs national.
Right now the children travel and play too much of unnecessary form.
I at least see the fruit of the compulsive certifications and course for leaders, table officials and referees.
That pleases to me.
What you do now?
More than I do is to listen to music, to see videos of the music of my time in YouTube, to enjoy me to my grandsons and from time to time to go to basketball games.
And clear, to enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who always has been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies

It took joy to him who it knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, graceful, affectionate and talented, and I will surprise it very many.
“Era an original person and lived the life to the maximum”, affirmed Gray in an official notice.
To Hagman they diagnosed hepatic cirrhosis to him in 1992 and recognized that it had drunk much during years.

They initiate course that explores the “End of the world”
Every week, the students explore apocalyptic subjects like the nuclear war, the zombies, the virus and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor in Stuart Charmé religion decided to distribute a course on the end of the world, knew that it counted on an irresistible hook: The aim of the “long regressive account” of the Mayan Calendar, the 21 of December, to that many people like a test that have themselves obstinate the end of the world comes.
Pero Charmé did not have idea than it hoped to him in the following pair of months: The cataclísmico Sandy hurricane, a fiscal precipice that some have called “deudarmagedón” and an increasing conflict that it involves to Israel, the place where the Christian theoreticians of the time end think that the Apocalypse will begin.
“I did not realize of which this it was going to be the semester more apocalyptic than it has had”, it said to Charmé this week to the students of the Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If one analyzes what is happening in the world nowadays as if we were to 30 days and counting, this it has been a really good period.
And they remember that bad it is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not only professor who offers courses on the “end of the world” this semester, in theory the last one of history.
In Weather, the attached professor Average Barry Vacker is distributing the course “, Culture and the end of the world”.
Every week, the students explore apocalyptic subjects like the nuclear war, the zombies, the virus and germs, and global warming.
“We analyzed why these ideas proliferate with time”, it said, and the way in which offers hypothetical scenes that guide certain human conduct.
If the nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could explode.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic subjects and explored how they compare themselves with examples of the real life.
“I have tried to inform to the students exceeds what is possible, probable, credible and impossible”, said Vacker.
In the main campus of the Pennsylvania State University, the professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and its colleague Amara Solari, an attached professor of History of the Art and Antropología, has made equipment to distribute a course, titleholder only “the end of the world”.
“We did not add “2012” to always count on the option to distribute the course again, in case the world does not finish”, Restall said.
In spite of the “imminent ruin”, the students must study, generate projects and take final examinations.
In Penn State, the final examination will be taken in eve of the Apocalypse, which does not leave to the students another option more than to work “until the same night in which it assumes that the world finishes”, Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
“It was saturated in two hours”, said Restall on its course for students with high average, that filled with 35 students.
We receive messages by e-mail during weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, of people who asked if still there were place.
The students, on the other hand, assure that the course is one of most interesting.
“He turns out to Me fascinating to see what the people make to be consoled to themselves”, Bridgid Robinson, a student of the race in Religion said and Sociology of 23 years of Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality, is only question of consolation or the absence of the same.

But no interviewed student - and much less a professor - said to believe in the expiration date of the 21 of December.
“Our first project tried on the Mayan prophecy and of certain way we discredited”, it said it Julie Zeglen, student of last year in Weather, 21 years and West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
But it limited that an apocalyptic anxiety in the western culture, that goes back to several centuries, in which exists people reacts around to the changes to his predicting the end of the world.
Internet has caused a height of these speculations.
“About other sides people do not think about this”, she said.
In mainly in the world of English speech.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion of the La Salle University that distributes courses in the Philippines this year, responded to the question quickly of if he knew there on some course on the “end of the world”.
“The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world”, it wrote, insinuating an exception of an authority superior.
We have an indult of the Pope.
Restall made notice that throughout the years it has been spoken of many days of the final judgment, and said that if the 21 does not pass anything of December, “people will begin to think about the next date” or to philosophise immediately that the 21 of December is the beginning of a period of seven years after which the world will finish.
Students and professors are taking lightly the date.
Several said that they think to go to celebrations “of the end of the world”.
