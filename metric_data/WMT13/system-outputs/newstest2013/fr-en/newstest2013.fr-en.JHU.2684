A Republican strategy to counter Obama's reelection
Republican leaders justifièrent their policy by the need to fight the election fraud.
However, the Centre brennan sees it as a myth, arguing that the electoral fraud is more rare in the United States that the number of people killed by lightning.
Moreover, the Republican lawyers have identified 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: the new rules will affect negatively the turnout.
In this sense, these measures will undermine in part the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the United States is responsible for organising the federal election in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments promulguèrent from 2009 to new voting laws, making it more difficult or registration process.
This phenomenon has grown after the elections in November 2010 that turning added 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during the year of 2011 alone.
The new election laws require that voters have a card with photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws reduce the voting times in anticipation, invalident the right to register as voters on polling day and withdraw citizens with a judicial matter their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present an identity card with photo.
The Indiana became the first state to put such a requirement.
In 2008, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law in Indiana.
The authorities Republican empressèrent to extend it to other states.
Over the past two years, they parrainaient draft laws in 34 States to force voters to present identity cards with photographs.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens have no identity cards as the universal health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have ID cards with photo issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 does not have such an identity document.
He often costs more than 100 dollars to obtain an identity card required.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African-American, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of people aged over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required with photo ID card.
Much more.
Students of voters considered voting for more candidates, Democrats are not allowed in several states to use their identity cards with photographs from their institution.
However, those same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who vote more of Republicans to use the cards issued by clubs to vote.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
For 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic vote.
However, it appears that two in three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have sponsored by 2011 laws abolishing the registration of voters on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters seeking to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, in the general election in 2004, campaigns for the registration of voters have contributed to record around 10 million people.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have driven the registration rate of 17% of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states to reduce the voting period in anticipation.
For example, in the general election in 2008 in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-American, as they were only 13% of voters in the state.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They were only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of people who voted in advance.
In return, the whites who were 76% of voters were only 46% of the electorate voting in advance.
Of course the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters strongly objected to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes governing democrats.
The Attorney General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They have partly to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 States have passed laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with photo.
However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make more difficult the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
The criticism Democrats denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A report from the centre brennan 2011 shows that states that have adopted these laws are 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: the new rules will affect negatively the turnout.
In this sense, these measures will undermine in part the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes incorrect results, with false negative results or of false positives, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
What do hesitate even more men already reluctant to pass testing.
Pass the test or not?
We sought the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies in the United States, there were many contamination between the groups witnesses, so it is difficult to interpret the data and recommendations for farms.
Another study, this one European, concluded that a difference in mortality among patients who had a screening and those who do not have had.
The study also showed, with monitoring after 12 years, which was between 30 and 40% more likely to have an extension if it is not dépisté.
I commend the test from 50 years, or direct from 40 years if you have a parent who has had prostate cancer.
The original African-American men are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision when cancer was detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others who are indolents.
We really must explain to patients the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering options, not treating necessarily prostate cancers that do not harm the lives in the long run, in these cases, and opting instead for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men in whom we detect cancer will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
It will suggest that active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we will offer them treatment.
Increasingly, it accurately determines the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend, therefore, to pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with her doctor to determine whether it should be shown.
In cooperation with the International Society of urologie movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no magic recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress of the search, the right diet of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone mangeait well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked as, this rate grimperait to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian cancer society.
By contrast, it estimates that around 10% of cancers are caused by the heredity.
Many are also totally unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the reduction in the number of smokers.
Smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
This enormously detrimental to people's health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," deplores the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Given encouraging: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, the risk of dying of cancer fall by half.
The weight
The embonpoint and obesity are also an outbreak of the disease, according to the scc.
They accroîtraient côlon's risk of breast cancer, and the rectum of pancréas oesophage, and cervical cancer.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," ajoute-t-on.
Food
The Agency also recommends limiting consumption of red meat.
In too much, it raises the risk of being diagnosed with colorectal cancer.
Processed meat products, and they should be avoided.
The conservation of meat by fumage, drying or salaison can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," explique-t-on.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the links between cancer and vitamin supplements.
Their research is not conclusive for now.
Conflicting studies on vitamin E, says the scc.
When one of them showed a lower risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear either.
Moreover, Mr Beaulieu emphasises the importance of talking about his concerns and his family history with his doctor.
"That does not pass the test, the cancer."
The so-called Higgs examined closely
The expected announcement of the discovery of the so-called Higgs has created a stir, last summer, and for good reason.
We believe that this so-called participates in mechanism responsible for the mass of all things in the universe, just that.
And then there is the last particles whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of nature and the behaviour of the material - but that has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure whether the Higgs.
We know beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is a genuine new particles, and it closely resembles the so-called Higgs predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data uncovered this week at a major conference of physical, in Kyoto, seem to confirm, but it still lacks data to be absolutely sure.
Suppose that there is a long Higgs, since the chances of error seem SLIM, and see what it is.
There is, in this world, a law inevitably inescapable whereby two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and do not try too strong, you will be hurt.
But even if the physical particles is a very strange world, it, too, has such a law: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same quantum state "- the" rule "of roughly by some of them.
From there, the physicists rank the particles into two categories.
In one corner, there is a good citizen named close, who obeyed the principle of Pauli wisely.
And the other is in the bosons dirty, a bunch of anarchists who have no respect for nothing - at least not for this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons will then split into two groups, according to the site - absolutely extraordinary, for that matter - the particle adventure, Berkeley labs: the mésons, that we cannot tackle here, and the "force" particles, in which the great forces of nature is spreading and that the so-called Higgs is somehow related.
Here, it must be said, are not all of these bosons-l bestioles as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you are reading this column, it is thanks to an extraordinary so-called banality: the photon, or the "particles of light" is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, an electrically charged particles that accelerates or changes direction, that "bother" electromagnetic field in this specific location, just as a pebble thrown into a pond such.
In this "discomfort" born electromagnetic waves - of the light, or the infrared, or the ultraviolet, etc. - and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus, one of bosons "with force."
Field more stable
So it is with the so-called Higgs, except for the fact that this is another area, the scope of Higgs, which must be "upset" for this so-called appear.
However, this area of Higgs is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; for the alarmed, there has to be a very, very high energies, almost as if it were a frozen pond with only a very large rock could rider the surface.
That is why we need a huge particle accelerator as CERN - the broad Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of circonférence! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful again to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
These are not all the particles, or all the materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, never take himself on the ice.
And in the same way, it is not all the particles that interact with the scope of Higgs: those who do have a mass, while others - such as the photon, would have not.
Now, what does "can provide" all the research, ask Mrs plamondon?
For science, this is to check the validity of the standard model, Ms, and it also enables us to scrutinise any gap between the observations and predictions of Ms.
There are many to believe that this is because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" model and plug some holes.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, offering no explanation for the seriousness - oups! - or the dark matter, which is approximately 80% of the area of the universe - re-oups!.
But such differences at CERN has not been found until now.
Repercussions
The impact of this research in the everyday lives of ordinary men and women, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no.
Take: at the beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of laser, in the bell laboratories, suspected not the revolution that their work would trigger.
They saw scientific applications, but not the rest.
In fact, we said the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked in the bell labs, where the laser was invented in 1960 and who himself has developed the first continuous laser - the first were pulsés - in 1962 - from the laser was rather labo seen as a "gimmick."
Imagine...
And then the applications can also come from the use of research as an instrument.
For example, the same Willard Boyle has developed a small capteur of light in 1969, during its work in perspective.
This capteur, although this was not at all its original intention, is now "eye" in digital cameras around the world, and she received the 2009 Nobel Prize in physics.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, you never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... | duty
With his committee die with dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume shortly after a bill is preparing.
In this important area, much remains to be done.
It has tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr L. montérégie still lived alone in his apartment.
Prostate cancer which the rongeait left him a reprieve of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I did seven years ago," he says, "mi-raisin beloeil palliative care victor-gadbois was lying in bed at home, where it happened the day before.
"But it is always a shock, it cannot be prepared for it," he says.
The disease is his work: a huge weakness and unable to go to the toilet alone, and also to eat alone.
Attablé before an appetising lunchtime, he will be helping to eat, resigned.
Brave, sometimes even to smile, talk to strangers who are busy around him, give him his medicine, give him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that I am cure of diarrhea, it is humiliating," confie-t-il.
A few hours later, the team has found a cure for the disease.
"During our lives, we learn that a man is pisse standing," says Peter brodeur, psychologist at home victor-gadbois.
Reversing the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability" to accept the decline has, identified.
Because, according to several people working in palliative care, great times are at the heart of this decline.
Patients who come to the home of palliative care victor-gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a prognosis of living up to three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides care as "curative outcomes."
For Mrs A., 89 years, the worst fear is of dying "conscious and stifled."
But the disease has made me discover my children.
"I have good children also says that there would be a flight."
"I no longer have to want in life," she argues, before accepting that he poses a mask to help him breathe.
It expects all the same, in the coming days, a last visit to his son come to Italy.
At victor-gadbois it provides, with a group of volunteers, the body's care and food aid.
It is the palliative care, given when there is nothing else to do.
To make the death more comfortable.
In Quebec, is a bed of palliative care for 11 700 inhabitants.
This is very little when we know that we all end up dying a day.
Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, explains the dre christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the House.
Both the physical comfort, emotive or spiritual.
The dying, we will accept from providing care to the brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
They will no longer be obliged to monitor their sugar level.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, there was a beer to Mr X, died during the night.
This morning, it was his son who end beer underfoot the deceased.
"We help the relatives as patients," says Nathalie savard, Director of care.
In the home victor-gadbois, the days continue but have different characteristics.
With an old man of 93 years savouring his last family house in the Court, of stalled in its oreillers while it is falling in his honor, a young man of 36 years dying tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there are still three to five beds that are occupied by the cancer under the age of 45," is the dre christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the home victor-gadbois arrive from their home, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, which is designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient care to reached the final stage of his life, either at home, in the hospital or in care homes.
And several bodies, such as the House victor-gadbois and society of palliative care at home of big Montreal, specialise more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer.
It is precisely this big gap in health care Quebecois of several specialist palliative care doctors fear the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed sommités of palliative care which Dr Balfour mount and Dr. Bernard lapointe, travels to display their opposition to such a move.
According to the dre christiane Martel Quebecois of health, the system is not good enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to quality palliative care until it agrees to euthanasia.
Recently, she argues, I saw a patient from 14 days to the urgency, in great pain, but it is necessary for the relief.
I fear that patients are dying because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are fighting on their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
The hopes of survival of Helen Richard were already minimal when it abandoned a chemotherapy demanding.
When I announced to my oncologue I arrêtais treatment, she said she regretted that I stop to fight, she said.
However, it said that I was over.
Not care almighty
The dre Martel believes that 90% of patients who require carers to die, not to have complied with their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care.
But it must be said that palliative care are not absolutely immense power in the treatment of pain.
According to elsie monereau, Director of palliative care at the society of palliative care at home of big Montreal, patients would be resistant to treatment for pain in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors have so often use the sédation palliative, which amounts to hijack the patient until the time of his death, either in sporadic or permanently.
We cannot pretend not to hear this part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the patient not relieved will have the opportunity to have this sédation palliative.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean 'I want you euthanasiiez' means' I want to be relieved."
The achievement of this report was made possible by a grant of journalism research institutes of Health Canada.
Major property scandals in Quebec
Officials of the Haitian construction voirie, entrepreneurs, the collectors to fund political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia tell every day what they know of a great 'system', a mixture of the building industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
An "industry" which has cost taxpayers dearly Quebecois of, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It is curious as the system crumbles since we took the nut," ironise Jacques duchesneau Montreal, Quebec MP and former police chief.
It is through him that the scandal erupted in 2011, through a thorough investigation on corruption related to road work contracts in Quebec, to which the then liberal prime minister, Jean charest, had agreed to reverse.
The report "duchesneau" established a direct link between industry, hidden financing of parties and corrupt officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, souligne-t-il, the only department of transport would have saved $1 billion on contracts," some réfrénant their instincts to touch a share.
The Commission has already brought down two mayors charbonneau, ajoute-il, hoping it can "demonstrate the ploys behind people."
A permanent corruption Unit, created in 2011
The ongoing corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also working with its army of auditors, investigators and analysts of the government.
More police officers from the "escouade hammer that since 2009, would have led the cartel sewage in Montreal to be applied the soft on the gonflements contracts...
In recent weeks, it has carried out a series of raids and made accusations of fraud and corruption against the elected municipal, as frank zampino and Richard marcotte, mayor of a city suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles vaillancourt, who is to resign from his position as Mayor of Laval, third of Quebec city.
He is suspected of having pocketed repeated bribes in exchange for government contracts.
Are formally accused also of the Montreal voirie engineers and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony accurso and Lino zambito.
He has raised eyebrows by explaining to the Commission the mechanics of the system for obtaining government contracts.
He has paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia which reversait Union money to Montreal, the mayor's party gérald tremblay.
Mr zambito has sown in all directions in the 2000s, giving more than 88 000 CAD - about 68,000 euros - to provincial parties, especially the liberal then in power.
It also avouait holding a collection of illegal funds for the ex-vice-premier liberal minister, Nathalie normandeau.
Sewage contract he gonflait costs
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked well.
Gilles surprise, public works, has detailed ex-ingénieur before the Commission: in 10 years, he has received from construction companies gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes totalling $736 million, in exchange for contracts sewage he gonflait costs.
Other officials of the voirie admitted being graisser legs by pumping up 30% to 40%, with forged bills extras.
Then a mayor's party organiser, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr tremblay of having deliberately turned a blind eye to a budget parallel fueling its coffers with dirty money.
Following the revelations, Mr tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in a major crisis.
Chantal scroll was one of the first elected in Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the district of rivière-des-prairies, to the east of the island, it is from 2010 opposed the sale of a local ground bought $5 million and sold... to 1.6 million of property developers, booming.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
Of the investigation that will eventually be put in place, she says she "draws on a thread to understand the system operates, penetrated by suffers, to stop the gangrene and pinpoint the culprits."
The process, she argues, is "painful but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wound but there should be a proper investigation unit in Montreal and a vigil, not to see back the dubious practices.
As we build the household.
Regularly.
Jacques duchesneau note for his part that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars, but is especially worried about the role of elected aware of the ploy," when they trempaient not in the politicking.
70% believing the dirty money in campaign financing in Quebec, it ironise: "I was told that this was just a pale reflection of reality."
The government Quebecois of 100 dollars proposes limiting donations to parties but it will not change the situation, he said: "if we do not strictly limit election spending, there are dirty money in politics."
It calls for an overhaul of the system of granting state contracts and financing parties: "We cannot go lower; get to the bottom of things, with courage, will help to rebuild the House on a firmer footing, with more controls and laws."
If this history tarnishes the international image of Montreal, Quebec and Mr duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in their own Court...
"The psg is not the Mediterranean Barcelona!"
This season, you took a new size with the psg.
How do you explain this progress?
This can be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of psg.
Of great players arrived.
Every day, I go to their side.
The technical staff has been given me.
Every day, these elements lead me to lift my level of play.
And, in a match, it is easier.
Everything is very quickly in football.
But I will not catch fire.
For my debut at centre of préformation INF clairefontaine saint-etienne on my visit, I have always made by staged.
You have therefore benefit from competition set by Carlo ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to playing matches at the highest level.
They also know that the training is crucial.
This means that a player like me want to tackle and to provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo ancelotti gives me much about my position.
It is supported by the Deputy as Claude makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the man for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect among the technicians.
Today, he has no equal in league 1 and is one of the best European trainers.
It was a great experience and has won a lot of titles with clubs huppés.
It has côtoyé of great players.
I think it will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
Then I sortais a series of injuries.
The confidence it gives me also explains my performance.
How would you assess the first part of the season psg?
In League 1, Lyon has been the leader.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our key objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the final with the way 8es.
What is the objective of the club in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Now, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in very good European teams.
First, we want to finish first in our chicken, in Porto, to receive during the eighth final return.
The psg can become a big European club in the short term?
It already has the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and be there for the long haul.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the psg has the means to make it happen.
In League one, not win the title, as last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year, it was really care to pocket the title of champion.
Last season, it has not gone far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
There has been a huge season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we are supposed to be champion.
But another team, Montpellier, has done a fantastic season even more.
This year, I think it is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think that we have the weapons to win.
Do you think that the media are too psg?
It is normal for us to wait many of us in view of what has been invested and the players that we have.
We accept it in full.
Later, when we won 4-0 at home against troyes and that there are still things to criticise us, it is that it is a little frustrating.
One wonders what people expect more.
We can never win 4-0 all weekend.
It is not the Mediterranean Barcelona!
We try to set up a project of game.
A team is built over time.
It has proven in the Champions League that we could meet here.
Look at Manchester City that does not happen, for two seasons, to qualify for the final 8es, made huge expenses.
Given the sums invested, you imagined with 15 points ahead of the truce.
It was neglecting our opponents and the championship in France.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boostés" by this new psg.
It shows that the premiership is exciting.
I hope that we can have a smile in May by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we eventually won.
The psg seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
As well as being told that there is a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very good and it puts a lot of goals.
It has come to that and it shows that it is the star of the premiership.
He has shown wherever he went he was a great player, a global star.
In the Group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
This encourages others to lift their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How have you seen the euro 2012 with the French team?
As a disappointment.
I was ready to participate in the euro.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from bargain of game time.
I saw things there and I am emerged stronger.
Today, I come to achieve good matches in selection.
That is what I expect from My baptism with the blues.
We have learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine and they must now have an exemplary behaviour.
How would you assess the first months of Didier deschamps head of blue?
It has the results for him.
It is well placed in the group description for the world.
The sélectionneur is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the wins.
As was Laurent white.
But I do not want to make a comparison.
White had achieved its objective to qualify for the euro.
I hope that Didier deschamps will lead the blues in Brazil.
The right one - a 1-1 score draw hair, on 16 October, Spain is a founding match?
This match has given us confidence.
Each has fought for everyone.
Before the shock in Spain, I had never lived in this match in my career.
With bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The very opposite of current currency transactions, based on central banks, identified transactions and the costs of treatment between the parties.
In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system of banking monopolies, led to financial crises.
In fact, invented by bitcoin satoshi nakamoto, a pseudonyme, is both a virtual currency - but convertible into dollars, euros - and a protocol secure in the manner of exchange bittorrent, which allows the exchange of files in hand in hand.
About 200,000 transactions have been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept the bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, having reached a peak of 30 dollars - 23 euros - in June 2011, has fallen to $2, five months later, before commenting today around a dozen dollars - the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com.
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in currency or real in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank is interested in a report on the virtual currencies published in October.
She described bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the most successful", "in competition with the dollar or the euro currency" and "similar to conventional."
Bitcoin stands out from other types of virtual currency as the "credits," used to advance in a video game that you earn by playing or you can buy - and sometimes exchange in return.
The social networking site Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, each time, a central authority control and trafficking trade.
With bitcoin, all the difficulties of the network are both accounts, own book depository, issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two electronic addresses in the manner of an email.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a system of dual key encoding.
The network will also check the authenticity of the transaction.
The contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the public accounts bitcoins traded exist throughout the book and broadcast throughout the network.
The milestone is to write this new transaction in this book.
It depends on the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and that the winner, sort of interim central banker, will have the privilege of pulling this line.
This is a phase of hachage file processing, which is a big file into a single digital footprint and shorter.
The computers' take 'the new transaction and will add a number before the whole "grinding."
The aim is to find the number that gives a special mark - a lot of zeros at the beginning.
Once the number found, other difficulties easily check that this is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructiblement linked to the chain of all the other transactions; any changes would affect the footprint.
If a user wanted to evade paying twice with the same money very quickly - less than ten minutes - one of two transactions would be validated by the network - the other being an orphan because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer has solved the challenge win 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by 100 millionth, leaving the room...
The difficulty of the challenge is also noted for each increase in the power of calculation.
The life of the network has had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for bitcoin were attacked and deposits bitcoins stolen.
"The flaw used is not the protocol itself," assures stone noizat, which has just launched paymium payment, a company in real currency using the network bitcoin.
The ECB also mentions the possibility of laundering money through this service anonymous.
But the cash is also missing.
Serious players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the blogging platform wordpress, accepts them.
Recently, ADI Shamir and dorit RON, the Weizmann Institute in Israel, have studied the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not.
In November, the giants' balances have been launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," welcomes Jon holmquist, who works for coinabul, which converts the bitcoins gold.
Peter noizat teaching, author of a book on the currency, many believe the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card or real currency or a payment by mobile without contact, but it uses bitcoin to validate transactions, which are so much cheaper.
The carrier handles over its identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement among dealers, who do not need to install new hardware or software.
They only need to communicate an address that a phone cannot "and acknowledged," says Peter noizat, holder having thousands of users.
There is a prevailing questioning the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for bitcoin is required, but 2013 could be a turning point," prédit-il.
The ECB, in his report, also plans to reassess the risks generated, today considered high, in the event of success of the currency.
We went to Afghanistan.
And after?
The French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan - kapisa and surobi.
NATO and the US should follow end 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and that Afghans choose their future, without any wait for us.
It is mainly Afghan farmers that we have punished regarding them as terrorists.
And we, with our 88 soldiers killed and wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former heads refugees in Pakistan, but often farmers who refuse the foreign military presence, as the Soviets' time.
They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even if they were joined by the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will not be when the West will be more discreet.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base nijrab, that I have seen from the top of hills planted amandiers thanks to credit French, is in order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks entered Kabul without being attacked, survolés by helicopters.
There will be no flood of Taliban in Kabul by the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their steady progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty, the country to burn because of fights between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price of obscurantism of these farmers exceeded by the Organisation of al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved nowadays.
Former Mujaheddin, current Afghan government and Taliban are united in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The most notable of the war antisoviétique returned to power in 2001.
They are mués in business class, seizing of government land to sell them in land for building refugees returned from Iran and Pakistan, huge American outsourcing contracts.
They have déconsidérés; most of them have not even fought themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American largesse: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideology.
They have côtoyé the modern world in their exils Iran or Pakistan, they have enjoyed the benefits.
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, government schools are full, girls and boys.
It will provide work for those young people who will not return to the dark ages of old parties or leaders to corruption.
Everyone, including armed opponents are fond of mobile phones, television, and its feuilletons Turks who have a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now there.
The authorities who will command be regarded as legitimate?
The former commanders of the fight antisoviétique already try to reconstitute the provincial militia, which échapperont at central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, the strong local identities, should enjoy some decentralisation, the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to turn it into a strong central government to presidential power, removing the Prime Minister which existed since the 1964 constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular the elections due in April 2014.
But his country has, since the 1950s and well before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been restoration, no dam is in state, no important irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing happened, but fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to private enterprise.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, a government control on infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth.
This has only added to the feeling that the West were there to grab it.
Without power to deal with the iron ore and copper there, or transport for export through the mountains, there are no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine in my Aynak, leaving the archaeologists - financed by the World Bank - International search the vast Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province.
It might take a day that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French troops combatants ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of the traditional aid: school for girls, boys, department of French at the university, French institute, military cooperation in the fields, legal, medical and agricultural, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, to try to "win hearts and minds" and achieve the impossible task of matching civil-military aid and offensive actions, a service of "" the Ministry of Defence - cimic - deleted and carry out in 2012, led by a small French NGO, many agricultural collective interest and rehabilitation work in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, greedy in local workforce, could help to contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, replanting trees, soil and increase of farmland.
What are we going to leave as memory, after two billion in military spending?
A far more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local conditions, very hard in these valleys located often more than 2,000 meters.
The embassy has received dozens of small agricultural achievements written requests from local communities in the province of kapisa.
To release of the insurgency waged by foreign groups what farmers told me to, we must maintain in their favour a small civilian aid, well controlled and that affects them directly.
A constitution to task in Egypt
It is a new gamble of President Mohammed morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever about the constitutional Declaration, which gives it temporarily empowered, he decided to play his va-tout.
Took everybody by surprise, it was announced Wednesday that the constituent assembly would vote his final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the head of the state had given two months to this House to finish its work.
For almost two years that Egypt had a provisional, repeatedly amended text which undermines the stability and led to legal entanglements.
This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country.
For his opponents, the President is persisting in its autocratic "madness," continuing to "betray its word" and "over the law."
On the side of his supporters, means that this is a way to stop as soon as possible with the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the process of transition.
There should be a referendum within 15 days.
A very short time which obliges the brothers to drop their plan to explain the text, each article, the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way back to a popular and democratic legitimacy as the protests raged across the country.
Mohammed morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for it, as he said in an interview with the weekly us time.
As the use of a rushed vote takes the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I still empowered them to supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is a strange atmosphere in which 85 members of the constituent assembly, Islamic majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most liberals were missing from the appeal.
Middle, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had claqué the door, believing I could not make their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
So that the necessary quorum is reached, members of replacements, 11 people have been added to the rush, yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were adopted.
Commentators have also enjoyed ourselves whilst the fact that one of the only differences of the day has spoken about... the time of prayer, some members of the committee as the pendulum of the constituent was poorly regulated.
The text, which was still being voted yesterday evening, contains 234 articles.
Finally, objects of attention, Article 2 is identical to that of the 1971 constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafi parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to replace the principles "by the rules, which would have allowed a stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not changed is a measure of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," meet the Liberals, who only see it as a blow to communication.
Because they believe the Islamisation of the Constitution is through other articles.
They include Article 220, which gives the university al-Azhar an advisory role, particularly with regard to verify compliance with sharia laws.
According to the expert in Egypt Sophie apple orchards, this is worrying because "people asked to vote are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of a theocracy."
The fears of Liberals attisées by the fact that the next rector of the university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment, there is no specific religious involvement.
With this Constitution, it remains within the framework of the civilian government.
Most of the lawyers who worked on it are not ulamas but academics, for some trained in the French system "dampening Alexis blouet, which prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional succession.
But he acknowledged that "there may be some ambiguity over Rule 220, because the words go to religious vocabulary.
Reference is made to "fiqh" including... Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr.
And it may in the future be about how judges are competent to rule on civilians."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is very critical because of the powers it gives the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claim that they are considerably reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another point of contention: the powers granted to the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but the national security council.
Neither will be banned the trials of civilians in military courts, as were the human rights groups.
They are also expressed their concerns about the text, they deem yoke.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now banned, which could have serious consequences on the freedom of speech, the press in particular.
In addition, any rule does not reflect the protection of women, highlights heba morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
She said that the only good thing is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
The word was not in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President must speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
The support of the state's chief défileront them Saturday.

"That language is, to Moscow will": the migrants save money to learn the language
While the Members and human rights activists polémiquent on what will give the law on compulsory language test, fraudsters selling of 'false' certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers coming to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, these are people from Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their purpose: to earn money to help their families remained in the home.
From 1 December, a law took effect and stipulates that every migrant worker must pass an examination of Russian.
For the moment, this rule applies only to those who wish to work in the service sector, housing, personal services and retail.
However, with time, promises the federal migration service, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will validate the knowledge of the language, but also the history of Russia and rules of law.
It will be necessary to validate its Russian language skills to obtain and renew his work permit.
Are exempt only people from countries where the Russian is the official language.
People who got certificates or teaching qualifications before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are not affected by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Institute of Russian language pouchkine, peoples' friendship University, the Moscow State University, Russia's St. Petersburg State University and other institutions of higher education.
Immigrants can pass the tests in all the cities in the country: more than 160 centres have been opened across the territory.
This initiative to introduce tests was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal migration service.
But, before the law takes effect, human rights activists have already repeatedly raised the issue in the press: what does it will give?
What is the obligation to know the change for the Russians and the Russian immigrants?
First, are the representatives of the migration service, it will reduce the number of people suffering from slavery to work."
Much talk of defending the rights of migrant workers, is the director of the office of the Russian federal migration service in Tajikistan, Victor sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only a selection system organised 90% will resolve the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not speak the language and who do not have a medical certificate.
Without an understanding of the language, certifies sebelev migrant, the future is intended to combine dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping, it will provide a "journey" in a maisonnette overcrowded where he and dozens of his fellow tourmenteront for months without food and paper and will trimer between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"At home, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are wrong, we take their passports, and they do not affect the planned wage," confirms the head of the direction of migration services for the migration service work Tadjikistan tolib charipov.
I do not stop, the policeman over!
However, many residents of the Central Asian republics who wish to come to earn money in Russia that they are not only not entrust the language of the country where they want to go, but they also write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, this is not their fault, but their plight: bit of Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow just one primary education satisfactory.
Indeed, their families have not even food for their children, not to mention the dress properly and to equip them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people are making money when the opportunity arises.
It is difficult when you do not know the language, confient-ils.
"You sense declined and diminished."
Human rights defenders notice but an important aspect of the law on the language.
The tests are designed solely to migrants who have a legal status.
Without official status, there will be no consideration or to work later.
However, most of the migrant workers still live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or defence to go '
Many immigrants explained that it is not so easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason? administrative barriers and always the language difficulties.
Moreover, the legalisation costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then you can get a false registration quickly for just 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have forged documents, that we do not have to register, where cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what is buying cigarettes, tea," said journalists oumed khouchkadamov, national Tadjikistan.
"Would soon skimps not and achète-toi a beautiful work of art '
From the first day of the entry into force of the law on the language, it was discovered that the registration papers for migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false certificates of language exams have been confiscated by the employees of the federal migration service.
The fake papers out of an ordinary printer colour.
Of course, their new owners have not had them for nothing: each migrant who hoped and facilitate tests had to pay seven thousand rubles to the document.
It is two and a half times more than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Representatives of power and human rights activists agree that the short term objective is to protect the system against corruption so that it is simply impossible to buy these "piece of paper."
The authorities can give to migrant workers who could not validate the examination of the first blow the time to follow the language courses.
In addition, the immigrants who do not know the Russian will be offered a job in areas that do not involve actively communicate with people.
The Ministry of the Interior are not considering the arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Interior Ministry is proposing to strengthen the law against civil bear arms.
Such is the authorities' response to recent incidents: whether the rocket made during the marriage or the killing organised by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry vinogradov, who made seven dead.
The police to ban the wearing of weapons to rubber bullets in public places and raising the legal age for getting the licence of port of weapon in the passing of 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma's Committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina yarovaya who has promised that the amendments to the law on the weapons would be introduced to the State Duma shortly.
Not everyone is pleased to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "self-satisfied the screw."
An open letter appeared on the Internet in which its authors, representatives of various centres of rocket, require to abandon "the hardening crazy."
The percentage of crimes committed with a gun registered is minimal, said the Russian service vasiliy lesnikov, lawyer and expert on crime for the BBC.
According to the statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a gun registered in the police while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the tightening of laws on civilian weapons will not prevent criminals to buy the black market.
According to them, can be found today in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior says it control the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from the factory to the officer
The black market arms imports through several channels.
The main channels are at number five, says Victor baranets, a retired Colonel who served 10 years in the Department of Education and the headquarters.
Capture of screen from a site taking orders for weapons
The first is "the sign, which means" military weapons that have been stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons have been stolen by the Russian officers, but also by Caucasians," explains baranets.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals to the forces of law and order.
Baranets explains that it is both weapons stolen in the stocks of the police as stolen directly to representatives of the security forces.
The illegal pistols go on sale since the military warehouses.
Many of them have often suffered explosions.
"Attested versions indicate that some fires were deliberately triggered to conceal the deficit," says the former military.
For baranets, arms manufacturers are for something.
"You see private arms factories that do not compete with competition in the international market and sell weapons on the black market, particularly in Moscow," says an expert.
One of the other sources of black market is smuggling.
An important part of pistols and assault rifles from poor countries, as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia was formed and provides supply," added the former military.
Where are the weapons?
Experts have estimated the part about every source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was set up in 2011 by the Centre for analysis of the problems and to study for the public administration.
Experts have analysed the rosstat reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the criminal case and the public data portals of the weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, say the researchers, from the army and the security forces.
Half of the weapons found on the black market was found "due to lack of employees whose work is linked to weapons," explique-t-on in the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from places of military conflicts, 14% are stolen during the manufacture and 5% are from "illegal searches."
A seller and consultant to a long armurerie requested to remain anonymous ensures that no one buys weapons found by the authors of the illegal search; they are too old.
Most often, he said, sellers will seek the new military goods in warehouses.
The person buying through a teaches a unit, for example a pistol TT.
One book in passing the good it by a fence.
"It's city and resell for 900€ transports the unit with two chargers," raconte-t-il.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are to be investigated, it does a purchase of control from illegal arms dealers," adds the seller.
"As in a shop of luxury"
The seller and the buyer are usually through knowledge.
I consulted websites, blogs, until a kind occurs and would like to come to the station begovaya where someone was take me in a corner to haggle.
The price of the gun, I have given up
Victor baranets in military observer
To find a gun, it is that I know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I do not trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there is also coming in saying for example "from this person, who has asked me to convey that his daughter has lost a tooth."
Now I buy a pair of American box with a person who I trust.
He is the only paper to me because he knows that I will not.
The small new seek weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor baranets has tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid 1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The plans, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album photograph in which there was "anything you like."
"I believed in a shop of luxury," remembers the military.
There is no secret to the buyer, explains baranets, you can try anything.
As a potential customer, I am not just to buy, you go with the seller in forest and it generates a target.
"It leaves me learn and when I am convinced that the weapon goes well, you start to negotiate," describes the expert.
A shop for his comfort
The search engines are the sites and arms vkontakte where you can buy the groups' for various uses."
For that, you need no documents and person to meet.
"You need a specific amount of money," écrit-on into advertising on the site "buy a gun or a mitraillette fighter."
Users have paid their request and pose their questions.
And we sell to minors?
"Without permits, of course," asks the user "Ivan" - spelling retained.
"Buy TT. fedorenkov Moscow," wrote in his request very direct.
The Federal Security Service there was a huge network of fake sites and the spade ramasse people looking to buy weapons to fight.
People are jumping into the food as the wolves hungry and then they are to use coal in Siberia
Victor baranets, observer and former military
I have heard of such schemes, usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take the lead.
The buyer is making the payment on the automatic bounds.
"It gets in return a photo and instructions which is hidden the weapon," explains the Secretary of the association "right to a weapon," Dmitry kislov.
Victor baranets says that if an application on the site, you cannot be weapon and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service there was a huge network of fake sites and the spade ramasse people looking to buy weapons to fight.
"People are jumping into the food as the wolves hungry and then they are to use coal in Siberia," he says.
A Makarov for 100 dollars
The purchase of an illegal firearm, experts believe, can cost between 100 and 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry kislov Association's "right to a weapon," you can buy a gun Makarov for 100-300 dollars.
It will take about a month and a half.
It came out of the warehouses long by the management of these warehouses of average size.
According to the Ministry's official data, compared with the period janvier-octobre 2011, the number of these crimes has largely fallen 7% in Russia and amounts to 22,9 miles while confirmed cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs fell by 7.8%.
United States: employees of supermarkets and fast-food outlets are on strike
Almost a quarter of American teenagers spend by an army of cashier work among mcdonald' s
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against low wages charged by famous Walmart supermarkets and fast food chains such as mcdonald' taco bell, S Burger King wendy' S and Kentucky Fried Chicken short-term.
For the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will grow or a halt soon.
These actions are supported by the unions and left a number of associations.
In addition to the basic salary increases modest that employees receive among Walmart and in the fast food chain, the organizers of demonstrations want the creation of unions.
The sector is currently not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents per year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday," when a rain flood of taking balances million hit America and triggering some esclandres.
On that day, some employees of the company Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, have left their posts in organising pickets to strike with the unions and leftist activists in the shops of the company whose products are intended for consumers of modest and middle classes.
Walmart selling everything: in hunting guns through the layers of car batteries, the aspirateurs, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in the large supermarkets.
That is why many poorly paid workers in Walmart are only doing their shopping in the workplace.
The price and the selection of Walmart products have become one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheap partly because of low wages to its employees.
They also complain of hard working conditions, for example the lack of chariots lifts or scanners portatifs.
The participants' Black Friday 'protests demanded a pay rise, they have complained that the price of insurance provided by the company had risen from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
For the employee base among Walmart affecting 9.5$ now is a sum that it cannot afford.
Californian scientists from the University of berkley show that if Walmart increased the average wage to $12 per hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
This is 1.1% more of what it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred any wage rises on the shoulders of consumers every race in the shop would be 46 cents more.
They spend in a year only 12,39 dollars more than now.
Supporters of Walmart notice with satisfaction that the protest took place in only nine States and bore no harm to the group.
The "Black Friday" has continued in the shops of 8h night at midnight the next day and Walmart has sold about 5,000 times articles to the second.
Its coffers have done in all 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday."
The company spokesman Dan fogleman said in an interview at site of left huffington post as a "less than five" Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was merely a "operation of COM among many" from the trade union organizer.
"Customer next!"
The protests have continued this week in New York and were either shops Walmart gradual - in this city, they are not very popular, so they are not yet implanted - but McDonald's restaurants and other cheap.
Mcdonald' s announcement sell billions of portions and after they leave disease do not even give you and you do not pay the work you have done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the city council in New York
Currently, the federal minimum wage under the law and that of New York is $7,25 time.
The increase in time, but little fast-food outlets, on average its employees based on New York 8,90$ now.
No one is less than them in this city.
For me it is inconceivable to live with them in New York.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers working among mcdonald' s after the school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their primary source of income or wanted to stay there for long.
Today, I find myself to interview employees of mcdonald' s who complain to live with that salary and sometimes have to feed their children with.
On the other hand, in the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper found the comments saying that it is irresponsible to children if you don't know what you feed them.
The demonstrators who launched the movement Thursday to 6h30 near the mcdonald' s of the 40th street and Madison avenue demanded that the cashiers and cooks the bar are paid at least $15 per hour, an increase of more than twice that the current minimum wage.
They also demanded that are created by trade unions in the fast food industry.
The American law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish the protesters a syndicate of bullying or redundancies.
However, the administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a syndicate, grab of fast food is a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons.
One of the biggest is the extraordinary turnover of staff.
They do not agree
Other demonstrations stormy held around several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest has been gathering in the middle of day near the mcdonald' s of times square with the intervention of several policies of local democrats, including jumaane Williams, a member of the city council, who said: "mcdonald' s announcement sell billions of portions and after they leave disease do not even give you and you do not pay the work you have done honestly."
The demonstrators were supported by other democrats New Yorkers in sight, including by the candidate for the post of mayor bill blasio who said, "we must all support the employees of fast food so that they get a fair pay and the economic prosperity that deserves every New Yorker.
The New York Times has characterized this as the biggest demonstration that the fast food industry has ever seen in its entire history.
But only a few hundred people attended given that all were not employees of Bar, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
At the moment it is difficult to say whether this will spark a mass movement of small.
"For the moment, there is only moderately to fool the brain '
Lately, fans of new technologies are used to collect the augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, this summer is Google, which unveiled its current model at its annual conference and in November it was reported that Microsoft had made the request of the patent.
However, it is a meeting with the director of the Cambridge laboratory Microsoft's interactive 3D technologies group, shahram izadi, for scientists in this society, the glasses are already history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Can you say a few words what your research group?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to expand the borders of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole remained at the moment the pixels on screen flat and sometimes at tactile.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years and guess the radical changes that will happen with this interaction.
For example, the equipment xbox and the sensors kinect are a step forward, and almost no xbox sells today without kinect because everyone is interested in the order by the gesture.
We also reserve - the future?
- Although the kinect made the interaction, much is happening on screen flat, sometimes in 3D.
The seizure of the information has been improved, the system gets more data, but the yield, for the moment, not really.
We are trying to change that and we are working on real 3D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including technologies projection.
We must move the computer world in ours, in the physical world, the more tactile.
For that, however, we must identify not only the user but also the area surrounding it.
So we can complete the real world by virtual objects in a form more practical.
And to begin, do away with these stupid helmets of virtual reality.
- What do you think of the voice command?
It is popular, but not be overestimated?
We cannot say that this is a panacea: the issue of confidentiality is because we did not always want to inform others of his actions or his intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but everyone in its niche.
For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought to gestures, not broad gestures, but rather to discreet, small gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a tags brought to the hand that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
It is great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by a joint command, for example: gesture + voice.
- That is to say?
- For example, how would you miss this can demanderiez-vous?
This would happen with the floor and gestures.
As usual, I speak only.
- Oh, it will be difficult to recognize.
- So, you want to force users to adapt according to what the machine can or cannot do at some point?
- Not necessarily, but this is a rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will work on the development of new types of Sensors that will enable us to better identify human reactions.
For example, it can be laser sensors, they produce a good enough resolution in depth and that is very important.
- If you are interested in your work on the sensors xbox kinect, what do you do not like in modern cameras?
They lack depth resolution, or something else?
- In principle, is the current generation that we rely on in our work on the recognition 3d.
Of course it would be to get around 8 mégapixels with a speed of 1,000 C/S.
But the problem is not the mégapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
On this last point, all current technologies are good enough, this work adds to the inventors of algorithms.
We have to remember the resolution on the X and y axes, but also Z.
The speed is too much, the number of executives in the second.
Human movements are very dynamic, and the 30 C/S is really not enough, especially for the gestures.
Steven bathiche, our redmond laboratory has given by touch sensors delay regular treatment of between 1 and 100 µs, the current sensors being closer to the second value - 60-100.
Not everyone understands how this affects the human interaction and the machine.
I would have needed a device of its kind in my work, but without reaching for more executives in the second.
- But does not increase the number of cameras?
- The kinect now has three cameras, one of which is in fact an infrared emitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third is a usual capteur camera outside the visible.
It is not used to determine the depth of the subject.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or worse by increasing the required amount of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to the kinect, playing with the trend of cameras and see how it could help determine the locations.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not submitted his glasses in public.
Do you not think that from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technology, the glasses are one of the platforms with the highest perspective?
- Of course, walk all the time with a smartphone the hands is not practical, but I think that the best option would be an augmented reality "transitional" that you would from a platform cloud to move the smartphone glasses.
The glasses are a very personal device and that makes their strength - the personal elements are those that you are the only one to see - and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of objects holographiques virtual in the air is no longer accessible to Tony stark in iron man but also the mere mortal.
There is an issue on which the opponents of this idea pointing the finger: there is no sensation tactile!
The hands do not feel anything!
What answers your group prepares for them compared to this challenge?
- In my way, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand as a medium of image.
It is perfectly the pressure!
But there are also technologies that are really intended to give the palpabilité to these images in the air: for example the interference of several shelves ultrasound led to a point where the finger and which gives you the feeling at the moment is still low, a breath of air on the ends of the fingers.
There is also the use of worn on the tags poignets which affect the terminaisons nervous fingers, they are also a theme with prospects.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he would normally feel when he sees something?
- This is a good idea, we have not yet tried.
There is still a job away on which it will take long to give the evil: how to pretend to someone who is physically in a very small area that it works in an open area almost infinite - we are working on the concepts of carpet of race - nothing to do with those that are found in the fitness clubs, mobile platforms and also of playing giant.
For the moment, there is only moderately to fool the brain, there are still many years of work.
That is what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute rule of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not the culture - rosbalt.ru
"Petersburg rosbalt pursues the project the" vanguard "dedicated to cities that lie ahead, at the vanguard of culture and art.
This list ultra-sélective has already received outstanding players on the artistic scene of St Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the boundary of the city and have found a recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "rosbalt" is the painter extraverti kirill Miller.
The whole city is kirill Miller, this man rather barbu red clad, all that you can pass near the Russian museum or in the summer, the garden feasts and vernissages plugged in.
The tables of kirill Miller crowd always the crowds, whatever their place of exposure.
It is one of the conteurs pétersbourgeois fundamentally social and philosophical, one of the founders of new myths.
Petersburg kirill Miller is a distinguished Member of the vanguard of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also a symbol of the city, its appearance is smiling people and putting them in a good mood.
He recently made a culmination of barbarism in his hands and he has become the symbol of this instrument in St Petersburg, because he has matured enough to this difficult role of its existence, its philosophy and its image of bohémien.
 - Kirill, why do you read through the city while red and not in yellow or blue turquoise for example?
 - I have chosen the red as "specialising in the side and image.
In this world, the red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society.
Although in society, everything that is not grey is the aggressiveness and a negative unrest.
But my provocations are designed to open talks.
The history of my actions provocative is an invitation to the discussion.
 - And when have you come to understand that you had to be painter?
 - At the exhibition's palace of culture nevskiy where were my work.
I understand that this was my path.
Then, the wave of old painters unofficial was gone and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I began to link of friendship with the painters of the new wave, with those of the postgazonevchtchina that gave birth to "pouchinskaya-10 'and then there was more vague.
I am interested in theater, in the fashion, music, all issues except the words.
 - And it was in your clinical artistic... - it was important for me to be at the centre of the culture of St Petersburg where must meet the best creative forces.
In 1995, I was seated at pouchkinskaya-10 which housed before the work a club, a musical and artistic bohémien club, the home of the Petersburg Bohemia.
Many are born: the name I still see tequila-jazz chnour arrive with the project "van Gogh's ear."
Chnour and his friends chantaient songs easy play-back in maillots moulants, they were among them Igor vdovin, composer become popular.
When the group started to happen in live, it became "Leningrad."
Trakhtenberg drove some emissions before the time of hali Gali.
We have given them trakhtenberg and then his great career began, but its basic education and training, it is here that he has received.
D137 galérie, club griboïedov: these are artistic repercussions of the clinic.
Our employees are parties as familiar.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was held in the press: it was the price the personalities of our City."
I was appointed "painter of the year," and then my reign ended.
It is not easy to work in a new era with ancient rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity are different things, there may be popular, but not really a person of culture.
 - Your work is characterised by a recognisable style.
 - Many of my paintings are hits, they have a situation and a very strong acuteness.
I will have a scheduled exhibition "the Russian Museum in the Clowns."
The clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was someone of social, today it hurts and it is fear of being so.
But with the Clowns, just disappears, the tragic fall.
I love the grotesque farce, I have some ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world via the nakedly total and mandatory.
Today is the dress that matters, it is the mechanism outside, but not on the inside of the person.
Maybe we cannot give him a hand, but it is rather him spit the tronche.
And the lie will be wiped out by the way.
 Recently, we have seen you in the role of high player of barbarity. - a city cultural must have this kind of hero.
Who else but I can play.
 - Perhaps the art trade can also be beautiful?
 - Today the art trade must be treated, delicate, liquoreux.
The disintegration of the culture is happening.
Before, people were divided in herds, something like the supporters of Bohemia, the niais another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communautés, it is hard to please everyone.
I am not a ticket to 100 dollars to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going please.
Each star has 100 fans.
 - But thousands of people come see stas mikhaïlov!
 - These are people that we have thrown coming out, it is the social and sexual side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people come, 10 miles will not and ultimately this is less management, money, just languishes.
I have my fans, the key is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I peignais tables collectionneur had hung next to Falk or larionov.
I started with the usual tables are those that are painted at the end of life.
Today, people often confuses the ideas.
We say: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money specifically for the painting.
I am to this culture.
 - Kirill, what is lacking in St Petersburg?
 - Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official culture.
But not all of them can work in the culture.
Under the reign of good Tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand the culture, but they understood that we should retain the good experts.
In Moscow, there are now good consultants.
We have people here in St Petersburg that could be experts, but they are discarded, because these experts need to properly assess higher experts and their fraieront a path.
Currently, it is the "taste" fleurit rule.
The same erarta, but they differ in that they say honestly that they do not take any contemporary art, there are painters who must find other museums.
 St Petersburg - for you, what is it?
 - St Petersburg is not the cultural capital in Moscow, there is much more to culture, there is a ground for this.
And on our stones, art is hard to push.
We need a cultural ground and we have more readers and writers is bad.
In Europe, there are many curious to see exhibitions, concerts.
To us, this layer is very fine.
We must make art fashionable as was the case at the beginning of the last century.
Project done with the support of the stock of St Petersburg
Giving birth in space
The land is in danger.
Global warming or collision with an asteroid murderer.
The caravans of space shuttles with land on leave in search of a planet relief.
To save Humanity, the most important question is: how to continue to make our species live in apesanteur relief or on a planet?
I believe that there is not much choice.
There are two real planets that we can win, if only by assumption.
"This is Venus and MARS ', says Vladimir damper, researcher of the astronomical Institute of State p.k. chternberg - gaich.
If the conditions are more suitable for life on Mars, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500.
We cannot live there to very high altitude or into the orbit of Venus... in the area.
It has begun to focus on issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Even a century ago, it carried out experiments on plants.
Four generations of peas grown on orbit is différenciaient varieties in any way real estate markets.
Second, we have launched the insects, small flies drosophiles reproducing.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to the area to see how developed an embryo apesanteur.
You get to the exit a poussin quite normal.
It is then that the problems start.
"The problem is the fact that the poussin must find support, it must be on its legs and start to move," explains the director of the institute's laboratory of médico-biologiques problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences - imbp Vladimir sychev.
By not finding any support, the poussins agitaient disorderly fashion.
And after 10 p.m., the new born saw their instincts entirely it wither.
The poussins are acting not in the light or at her.
Unfortunately, they died just after quattre days.
"We have écarquillé us twice, then we have abandoned them, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir sychev considering the failure of the experience with the poussins in space.
The last "Ark miniature" organic with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite "bion" only embarquera species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetus in space.
In principle, we found nothing surnaturel.
"It was still biosatellites and can only experience. We need this kind of research," said Vladimir sychev.
After the landing, the rats in the area have led to their offspring.
However, it still fails to make reproductions directly into space.
This is not easy.
In losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to carry out their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, the man is capable, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, he was able to create a proper emotional content.
This kind of experience is not done for ethical reasons.
But women are in the area for the past 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the female body is what humanity's most valuable asset.
Our mouette has disappeared and anyone on earth could not say if it would after a flight into space.
If it could give birth to a child after the theft.
"No one responded to this issue," explains vakhtang vatchnadzé, missiles and space sector pensioner.
In June 1964, just a year after his flight into space, the first woman cosmonaute Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a girl.
The child's father, andrian nikolaïev was also cosmonaute.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaute Svetlana savitskaya, having been twice on orbit and have even worked in middle extra-véhiculaire, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have not even slightly cosmonaut who had nothing and give birth to a descent in full health after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even for flights into orbit," concludes the pilot and cosmonaute, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, valeriy poliakov.
But humanity must look for new solutions in biotechnology, protection against radiation and the creation of an artificial gravitation.
Laboratory hydrologie of cosmonaut preparation centre: compulsory part of the preparation for flight.
Here in flottabilité zero, the cosmonaut train to exits extra-véhiculaires.
Water following the apesanteur.
If water is comfortable for adults, but a foreign environment, for babies, however, is their true element.
The small men amphibies seem to confirm: life on earth from the ocean.
As the baby is around nine months in the liquid lymphatique the belly of its mother, then it is easier to get used to the water.
In principle, it is logical, since its birth until his first bath, it happens only 2 weeks.
"This is very little to forget," explains the swimming instructor for infants, Marina aksenova.
In short, if the child is born the apesanteur is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a force of weight.
In the muscles, the basin's belly atrophient apesanteur very quickly, the ability to push the baby is.
Well then, ignore that building on the simulators to birth.
Of course you can prepare a birth in a special, the woman will bring it out.
"And then?" asks valeriy poliakov to invite to reflect on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs a gravitation artificial.
If he did not feel the attractive land, the body is not the skeleton and the muscle system.
You cannot pay an infant as an adult with a special combination for the training.
It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.
"And the experience that we will have to consider in this case by creating the birth of a child in a foreign environment will bring the return to earth of a disabled child, fully désadapté," says the director of the institute for bioethics committee médico-biologiques problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor pestov.
The birth of children in the area is still the theory.
However, over time it becomes reality, when the land go in their commuting to a distant planet that becomes the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the isc - superior audit institution said: "the control of so-called independent work - in Czech 'system xC5 varc" has failed because politicians.
In the area of government procurement, the Czech Republic has inspectors competent and quality of legislation but it is lagging behind in terms of its application.
This is what said Miloslav kala, Vice President of the superior audit institution in an interview for aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is missing here," said kala in his explanation of the current situation.
An audit conducted jointly by inspectors Czechs and Germans also suggests similar conclusions.
He cited as an example of abuse "system xC5 varc's approach" by Petr Nečas.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS trouble was not entrepreneurs with controls; is permitted or prohibited?
"The law should be applied in one way or another, even if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot act one authority to inspect to demand respect for the law," says kala.
At the meeting of the Commission to control the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a project tchéco-allemand in which have been compared in public procurement laws in both countries.
What was it exactly?
There is a parallel control that we have launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation is how to manage public markets and specific national laws and a practice itself will follow.
We gathered it and although the control procedure is not yet complete, some very interesting differences we have emerged: generally speaking, our legislation may be "stronger and better," however, within certain parameters, the practice as such is best in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to continually develop more detailed rules but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law.
What this project can help you specifically and what résulte-t-il for you?
A joint control of this type should be helping to ensure that we stopped trying to clarify the laws, to fall and improve the thresholds, when this was not a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means get it at a reasonable price - which does not always mean the lowest - to exclude all enrichment and a possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the threshold of markets, we may not achieve this goal.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by red tape, that those who seek loopholes will be much more opportunities than if the threshold had been higher.
You talk about internal problems concerning the implementation of legislation on public markets.
How the control system works in Germany?
Is there a similar institution in our isc or a different form of organisation?
As far as institutions, similarly to the isc, works there the bundesrechnungshof organised similairement, it also has a Council formed a little differently, but these two institutions are basically in the same way.
The authority is also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance, however, with our system: Germany is a federal structure, it has also over the accounts of this type in the various States.
The brh can only control the federal money, which is home to the resources of the state.
The public funds managed home by the regions and cities, are there controlled in the courts of auditors land.
As for national legislation, is simpler than ours?
I do not want to make a comparison general without specific data, however, in some areas, Germany is often seen as a model but they surely cannot say that it is better in all areas.
This may be due to the fact that they have better inspectors?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, there is no data for comparison.
However, it must be said that this country that we regard as a model is also faced with a range of problems.
Otherwise, they would have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, no?
As for national legislation, that has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on public contracts, its effects are already being felt?
This amendment is relatively recently entered into force, it does not yet have an impact on our operations of control.
Subsequent checks, as we are, it must be about a delay.
Our observations are solely for the moment, the process of preparation for future controls - we have launched a new 'mismanagement' risk detection instrument with which we have been screened almost 14 000 contracts, these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds were changed as conditions for certain types of procurement procedures and so on.
So do you consider taking the bill rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm.
The problem that can happen is that these rules are stricter and it is not possible to meet them.
Already under the regime of the previous regulation, the provider - for example the Regional Council, in the case of the regional operational programmes contraignait subjects controlled to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means a breach of discipline.
Is it useful to tighten up the law in this way?
No, not in that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse but not punish those who commit errors formal irrelevant to the decision making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out?
Look where we are not.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS trouble was not entrepreneurs with checks on the supposedly system xC5 varc - what does that mean?
The system is xC5 varc banned or allowed?
The law should be applied in one way or another, even if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot act one authority to inspect and demand respect for the law.
He can say," we will change the law and allow ', but we cannot say that we will act as if nothing had happened.
The procurement law includes fairly strict rules on the tape to do, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated only formal because of defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and is, in my opinion, what is missing here.
The roads are frozen in places, but most are feasible.
In some places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also enneigées.
The network remains in most practicable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Region of karlovy vary
In the region of karlovy vary this morning, the roads were feasible, but in places frozen and also enneigées.
Temperatures have dropped and range between -5 ° and -10 ° C but they should slightly back in the day.
The Snow stopped in the region and there is a thin layer of snow in the lowlands.
The mountain crêtes métallifères - krušné Hory are swamped by around 30 centimetres of snow.
It is data from the regional service of road maintenance because of the fog, the visibility was reduced in places.
The fast track r6 and the national roads in the region are now feasible without difficulty.
The vigilance remains to put on some bridges, for example the surface can be frozen and ice.
All roads départementales and third category, including mountain roads, are also practical.
There is still snow on some of their stretches of remains frozen and in places tassée by traffic.
Especially in areas located in altitude, drivers must increase their vigilance.
Parts of pardubice and Hradec Králové
The direction of roads and motorways says on its website that some roads in eastern Bohemia are threatened by the formation of ice and snow layers tassées traffic can be found on the roads in the mountainous areas and located in altitude.
The services of road maintenance warn drivers against the risks of formation of ice in areas of the region of pardubice located in altitude.
There may be the ice in the vicinity of lanškroun ústí polička, nad orlicí svitavy or vysoké mýto, mainly on the roads départementales and third category.
The roads I/43 and I/34 around svitavy were treated chemically.
The snow is mainly in the mountain of giants - krkonoše - and the mountain of the eagle - orlické Hory.
In the districts of rychnov nad kněžnou and trutnov, a layer of snow tassée traffic is present on the roads in areas located in altitude.
In Eastern Bohemia, today will be dry, most often reached with any passages overcast times.
It will be blowing a weak winds and temperatures oscilleront generally between -3 degrees and + 1 ° C.
Pilsen region
The roads in the region of pilsen are now feasible, although, in places, it has to be vigilant and to adapt its conduct of weather conditions.
It is freezing this morning, temperatures range between -3 degrees and -9 ° C.
After the recent snowfall and cooling that followed, some routes can be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to cross areas of fog, visibility will improve gradually, however.
It is information from the regional service of road maintenance.
The motorway D5 is workable almost without difficulties, however, road maintenance services communications recommend increased vigilance among the 80 kilometres and 131.
The surface of most of the national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the pilsen-sud district and in the district of tachov.
The channels départementales and third category are wet and then applies the warning against the frozen sections.
Drivers must be vigilant, and it particularly on roads less crowded in the region of the xC5 umava.
Region of olomouc
Drivers travelling in areas of the region of olomouc located in altitude must now count with a layer of snow very dark and soft on the road.
This layer is left on the collar said "červenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards videlský kříž, after chemical processing operations.
The snow forced this night of road maintenance personnel to be on the ground, according to the services in charge of the voirie, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of xC5 umperk.
In other parts of the region, most of the roads are feasible without difficulty.
"On the heights district of xC5 umperk are the remnants of snow.
Drivers travelling towards jeseník can expect to encounter the collar said "červenohorské sedlo" a very dark snow cover and soft "čtk said today the Head of services to xC5 umperk district of road maintenance.
Their colleagues jeseník district were also there during the night, according to them, after the chemical treatment carried out, roads, are now available and mouillées, even in the highest areas.
In the District of olomouc roads are feasible without difficulty, in the district of xC5 ternberk drivers, however, should be careful in the sections in forest areas to roads remained wet.
Parts of ústí nad Labem and Liberec
As of this morning, the Northern Bohemia reported several difficult stretches of road maintenance services.
Police data shows that, in addition to some places covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from telnice to knínice na ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero in lower altitude, and therefore the snow and the ice are kept on the roads and in the lowlands, especially south of the Central plateau of Bohemia, instead, there is no problem and the roads are usually dry.
No difficulty of movement has been reported at the moment.
The services of road maintenance have reported the presence of ice, especially at around xC5 tětí.
According to Meteorologists, night conditions were ideal for his party: rain and melting snow during the day, clear skies and freezing during the night.
There are also reports, since the main traffic routes, difficult conditions on the route 13 on the border between the regions of ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the movement between telnice and knínice is due to the branches of trees that have courbées under the weight of the snow to reach the road.
To xC5 imon ornest said: "together, we want to collect the positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month that should be the end of the world?
This is just one of these alarming news, the kind of trap in which we love down.
In our group the tap tap, we rigole rather and we realise that we are the only group able to collect the remains of positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, you go up in December a completely unique project: three concerts at the end of the world.
Can you tell you more about this project to our readers?
It is a charity action that we prepare for the past two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar on 21 December announced at 11 p.m. 10 in the morning.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will be held simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
It is concluded almost as the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati which lies in the Pacific Ocean, on a fuseau hours ahead of 12 hours with us.
Who was this idea?
Initially I think it was my idea, then we have all designed with our Creator, honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, think about the state of the world that we leave to our children.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a unique collection of objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and the original key against the end of the world, by buying them online on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The group the tap tap with other interpreters has also recorded an anthem on the end of the world entitled "cancelled" end of the world - in Czech 'konec světa zrušeno'.
It is already very popular on YouTube, the entendra-t-on also at these concerts caritatifs?
Of course, in the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world does not...
It will be chantée simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts.
Anthems will also join at some point in a live broadcast, quite unique, Czech television.
The words of the song was written by Tomáš hanák which also takes the lead role of Jesus in the clip, xindl X also sings...
How do you come to cooperate with them?
We work with other figures of the Czech show-biz, because we have many concerts and events caritatifs...
We are trying to get them intensively involved in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such a cooperation and that about.
What are the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the studeo training centre that is accessible to people with limited mobility, and we are working to achieve within the Institute jedlička, with the tap association, and that for six years.
Teachers are regularly among the pupils of the institute jedličkův and offer them things that interest them and enjoy them.
The students themselves do not have the means to attend courses, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the independent institute jedlička we will transfer this project in a new building.
Several groups of music and performers get on stage at each of these concerts?
The criteria, do you choose?
We have tried to develop a programme aimed at all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, get on stage chinaski support lesbiens illustratosphere with Dan bárta, the tap tap marián bango and Jiří suchý.
You will find the details on www.kpks.cz.
Preparing to other méga events of this kind in the future? "
In May, we play for the first time as part of the Prague Spring; again, we prepare surely a good programme with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year in the House of the Czech Republic to New York and personally, once there in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, yet you played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The tap tap is nonetheless a group composed of disabled people.
How gérez-vous organisation and logistics of your tours?
This is not as terrible as it looks at first glance.
We have five Members in electric chair which devices should travel to bunker, naturally we trimbalons too much luggage and boxes of instruments.
So far it has more or less always gone well, čsa and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they have surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we found ourselves recently, everything happened without problems.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare what these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, of the public's attitude toward the disabled and so on.
What were your experiences so far?
After Luxembourg, Madrid, London and other places where everything works better than us, we have just seen in Moscow as the is all is only in an initial phase.
From Prague, Moscow is more accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet know that a person moves only in electric chair in the center of the city.
They are not yet evident to give priority to a person in chair in a lift.
Fortunately there, too, an association seeking to draw attention to the problems of disabled people is being created.
What do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are many things for which we are still lagging behind.
It is important to mention that the improvements and perfectionnements still depend on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a severe handicap move only in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, the museum, anywhere...
It is still not very frequent there that many disabled people are actively participating in social life, here you are, the tap tap, rather the contrary to the cutting edge.
The public's respect and the access facilities are one thing, but the situation really begins to change when we have here of sports, famous artists, actors, politicians or lawyers.
For the moment, there are some cases of people who have a strong will.
The group the tap tap is very popular, reverting back to a few years, what has driven in 1998 to create this group?
I began to work as an educator at the Institute jedlička, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.
And as I played - I, among others, the musician saxophone - with a colleague, we have created a music business.
And then, over time, according to our moderator láďa angelovič, there was a little lost control of the situation - laughter.
The success came only in recent years, if I am not mistaken?
It is true, creating links with singers known and work actively to promote the group has helped.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to European Union subsidies, we can afford to have good teachers, and more equipment, and so on.
You aim to reach such a level with the tap tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential for a change.
The show business is full of stuff that copy from each other.
In a way, that makes sense: everything new is agreed with caution and it takes a long time.
Rare are the original plans, and I dare say that tap tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally the pity is natural...
But the pity is meaningless, because people with disabilities are not in pain, abandoned by everyone, that we should take pity.
These are people who can live a full life and flourish, provided that the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities are to achieve something, this is not just a step forward for them, but for the whole society.
Does your success is also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you described by many people?
If we want to do good work, we must be firm in many areas and demanding discipline.
But I think this is quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and its head in the clouds and, when they realise that they have come to repetitions twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend much time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works in the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The group the tap tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
One, láďa angelovič.
We are an open group, people come and go, you can do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would want to join us.
It will be the day before the day planned for the end of the world, on Thursday 20 December 2012 at 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in Brno to fléda and Ostrava plynojem incheba arena, with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
Late in the evening, the three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when the group will be jointly chantée song tap tap "end of the world cancelled."
The purpose of the concert is to collect money, to the tune of 25 million CZK to equip the multifunctional studeo training centre which is in Prague in the institute jedlička.
The price of a ticket to the concert is 400 CZK, entry is free for children up to 12 years, the prévente tickets is open to bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as twentieth Member of this agency, it is the second Member of the former Eastern Bloc - the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland had begun working closely with the ESA in 1994 and in the years that followed has participated in a number of projects for the Agency.
Poland's road towards the area, however, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, the Polish fans worked on space flights; they had not always understanding.
I want to mention such as A. Conference xC5 ternfeld to the astronomical observatory of Warsaw, on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his pioneering book entitled "introduction to aeronautics."
The developments of this young engineer - born in 1905 - were the auditors cold and years later xC5 ternfeld rappela that only Dr Jan gadomski intéressa to its work.
In 1934, xC5 ternfeld got in France the price Robert esnault-pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book "introduction to aeronautics."
The doctor Jan gadomski 1899 - 1966 - subsequently became a great propagateur of Astronomy and aeronautics.
It published hundreds of articles in newspapers Polish and wrote many books dedicated to the science.
Gadomski became a propagateur of aeronautics of world renown, especially his contribution has been rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the dark side of the moon cratères.
From 1925 was built in Poland a draisine intended to be equipped with a rocket engine.
It is unfortunately neither the author nor the details of this project.
It is not clear if the rocket was supposed to propel or curb the draisine.
The only information known about this draisine are those of the press at the time.
From 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to the rockets.
The research was conducted by the Institute komórka techniki uzbrojenia in collaboration with teachers Mieczyslaw wolfke and gustaw mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the documents held that this research had reached the stage of testing.
Of course, with the arrival of the German Army, the research were interrupted.
In 1937, the photoélectrique hunting plans a rocket, designed by the engineer rohoziński specialist, emerged in the press and the following year was published the book "rakieta - torpeda powietrzna I rakietobomba lotnicza" of an author named leliwy-krzywoblocki.
These two projects were intended for military use rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects using the technique of rockets were led by the Scientific Advisory Committee provisional 'tymczasowy komitet doradczo-naukowy', which was coordinating all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the start of the war brought an end to its activities.
After the war, other work for aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish society astronautics - polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne.
For the first time, there is a company in the number of November 1954 newspaper's problem, in which are four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Mr subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to aeronautics
At that time, projects of artificial satellites have been launched and it was clear that the area of space research had for the future.
At the beginning of the year 1956, Polish society astronautics - PTA déploya efforts to enter the International Federation astronautics, founded in 1951, and by the autumn, the PTA became a regular Member.
The following year, the first President of the PTA Kazimierz zarankiewicz - 1902 - 1959 - became vice president of the Federation international astronautics.
It conserva his office until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the rocket meteorological rm - rakieta meteorologiczna - who became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, rm-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch held on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a range of 1,800 metres had an 80 cm long and weighed just under 5 kg.
Subsequently was built an improved version, rm-1a and, in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the rocket two-tier rm-2 bledov were initiated in the desert.
The rocket was a length of 1.4 meter and was probably 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to make concrete scientific research - the rocket rm-34 should have a range of up to 14.5 km and serve to observe the wind in altitude.
But in 1963, all the development work was halted.
The rocket meteor-1 development during the period 1962 - 1965, they installed the first swept rm type rockets.
This rocket, designed with double-decker, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models - called meteor-1a -1b and -1c - were developed and are distinguaient by the dimensions of the space for the scientific tools.
The rocket meteor-1a had an area with a volume of 0.4 per litre, while in meteor-1b this volume was 0.34 litre and meteor-1c 0,62 litre.
The maximum impact of all these types of gear was 37 km.
In the 1965 period - 1968, meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aviation Institute, the first flight trials began in October 1970.
The rocket meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and is capable of transporting a carrying 10 kg at an altitude of around 60 km.
Later versions were built meteor-2h and meteor-3.
We need to mention the entry of Poland at cospar - Committee for space research in 1960 and the creation of a national committee cospar two years later.
Under the programme interkosmos, Poland was also involved in space exploration on the Soviet satellites artificial and, in 1978, the pilot miroslaw hermaszewski after Mr Remek, became the second cosmonaute non-soviétique of this programme.
The repeal of the law on the work of public utility is not a solution.
Last week, the Supreme Court has repealed the law on the work of public utility.
This has raised in the public a heated discussion.
It is certainly interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
The economic systems geared towards liberalism, both within the EU and in the context of globalization, is based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means that the various economic entities and the national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This is the principle of free trade and free movement of unlimited private capital ally rush to financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of work - wages - generate pressure on prices.
Should be put under the term the significance: a producer tries by the import of goods sold cheap to resist economic competition by making it more expensive "the price of competitor, to remove more of the market and thus increase its own profits.
In large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: is shifting production abroad, either to buy cheap or disappear; the result is high unemployment in countries where labor costs are high compared to other economies.
As the private capital has no responsibility for social responsibility toward the unemployment it brings, and thereby the social costs of the state increase necessarily.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and to offset the economic and social harm caused to the whole of society in this race for profit.
This is the point of public knowledge that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistics.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital are in different economies a situation in which national governments are forced to engage in mutual competition to artificially lower the standard of living of their own people in order to attract foreign capital at home.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account the social collapse.
This is mainly in the amendments to the laws in force.
The goal is to force economically its own people to accept the dictates of the price of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This happens on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in case of unemployment in the long term and by restricting the rights of employees in the area of employment law.
The result is a growing poverty and deepening differences between the rich and the poor.
For years in Germany, there are points of public distribution of food for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There are already a million people.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for employees to receive such salaries that the State is forced to pay extra to reach the bare minimum.
Such a scandal was revealed, for example in the case of employees working as ancillary to the Federal Parliament.
Nearly every southern Member States of the EU economy measures generate, without doubt, a similar situation in which, under pressure from a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced to emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to just stumble along with low wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day the private capital to invest in their countries.
We have to ask themselves the question: where will the capital?
If it comes from other EU countries, so poverty will rise from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or even a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This includes all of Latin America.
The liberal theory to tire and the media claiming that the state cannot make investments in capital in its own economy, that the planned economy led to an economic disaster.
Private capital fiercely defends the notion that the state cannot intervene in the economy by regulatory interference.
We must wonder if private capital does not influence, and even runs not today, according to its own selfish interests, and by the same policy, the entire state.
The answer to this question is certainly yes.
The evidence is that there is almost a lobby almighty and present in all States.
The result is a desperate situation form in the field of corruption, through the provision of mutual benefits in the legislation, where everything is wrong but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is that, because of the lack of funding, the national ministries devolve building projects for laws to law firms tied to the industry.
These bills are then passed the Bundestag.
The entire power comes not from the people, like the type Western state constitutions, but strong financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that democracies geared towards liberalism are now quickly face a situation described by appianos in his book "The crisis of the Roman Empire in times of Caesar and pompée": "the state has long deteriorating and functions were attributed by violence.
The blows of bribes, winning obtained illegally, and the Stones and the swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The bungs and corruption proliféraient without limits and the people had the elections with voices already sold... "..." honest people have sought not to obtain functions, the result was once the state was 8 months without consuls. "We really began to say that the solution to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that he would choose a strong man"... it is true that appianos pompée had in mind, but it is Caesar that changed irreversibly democracy in absolute rule.
In conclusion, as in ancient times, today's society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and to uphold the interests of society as a whole.
As a result, now as before, a decadence without prior elites, no effort to carry out reforms.
We must therefore be the causes of the rise of fascism and communism in the liberalisation unscrupulous economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
As things stand, the disappearance of these systems can be seen in favor of liberal democracies such as something of a pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elite completely ignoring the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future deaths, social and humanitarian crises we are seeing today as well as crimes against humanity as we know them by history and recent.
The repeal of the law on the work of public utility is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from European competition, both internationally and at home, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the standard of living of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The solution lies in reforms aimed at sociopolitical, which will increase capital investment in the State in the economy, increase the influence of people into the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the state.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing will ever of violence and never will," said sting in song called fragile whose main towards the refrain is "let us not forget how vulnerable we are."
"If my son did not want war, it would not," said gutele schnaper, Mayer's wife amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions were high.
Some are taking the side of Israel, arguing his right to self defence and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others argue the Palestinians, citing racism of the State of Israel, seeing the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs and Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is guilty and who is the victim, in his recurring waves of killings; after all, Israel's current inhabitants, including those of autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and have not seen the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view: "behind the curtain," on those who benefit mainly tensions that already exist for more than 95 years - from the Balfour Declaration in 1917 in a small piece of the Middle East.
Some of these thoughts are based on historical facts available to the study, others from my own understanding of that, or more precisely the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of events in modern history.
Human history is primarily the story of a power struggle.
Every time we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these individualités acted independently or if they owed their acts to the throne to someone who ran their actions according to previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we live in a time when the global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration causing some financial powers could not happen in one generation.
Among the families with an astronomical wealth stands out particularly the Rothschild family, which could be seen as the head of the octopus - I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not rule it out.
Little is written on them.
Of course.
In the 1990s of the 19th century, they have become the first global news agency, Reuters, in order to put an end to the establishment of ties between their name and serious crimes for which they were involved and had always meant to be strengthening their power, an increase in their wealth or both.
They almost have significant holdings in most of the world's central banks and prepare or waging wars against the countries in which they have not yet of such shares before the invasion of Afghanistan's many of these countries were 4, 5, 7, after the invasion of Iraq after the overthrow of Gaddafi only meanwhile Russia has placed the Russian Central Bank under the control of the Russian Government.
Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln to Bank of America of Rothschild refused to renew the status of central bank and began to make during the civil war his own money - I hear government and was assassinated in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to send money home and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, the Member Louis mcfadden was poisoned in 1936 when he was taking legal action against the Fed for provoking the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for power globally led in the years 1859 in 1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a franc-maçon initiated the 33rd degree, in the highest level.
The first war was intended to eliminate the large state monarchies in Europe, the second was to remove the British colonialism, in particular, and the third would reduce the global population between 0.5 and 1 billion people - such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort, create a single world religion - the œcuménisme is nothing other than the beginnings of such a solution, and, ultimately, to acquire an absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families first and then the Rothschild is creating a crisis can provide a solution - order ab chaos - the order following the chaos.
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation - that the creation of the Fed not intended to avoid a repeat of the crisis as they provoquèrent in 1907.
Having managed to trigger the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand Habsburg the Austro-Hungarian throne, they was destroyed tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War is termina abruptly by a German capitulation without justification economic and military - the war was no longer necessary to the destruction of tsarist Russia, and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austro-Hungary, the power of central Europe.
For an easier outbreak of World War II, the bankers have left politicians create a situation of simmering conflict: on the one hand, they have imposed on Germany to waste war reparations and creates the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses - then they only need to place a strong enough leader, pointing the culprits, offering simple solutions - and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who should play the role - she actually tint of fifth column to crank up the conflict and war.
At the end of the 19th century, the rothschield inspirèrent the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspira to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of the historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital - return to Zion.
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above posa the foundations of a mass emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first Arab friction with local people began.
These acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, it is hard to determine if Hitler broke the channels in which international bankers had held initially; or if all he did was planned, the fact remains that the suffering of Jews in Europe in the concentration camps created the foundations of the acceptance of a Jewish state in the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way as war reparations imposed on Germany were at the root of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel has lit a fire home can cause a third world war.
If the international bankers to manage this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as the population generally Arab or Muslim Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at international level - just look at how people fall hard between supporters and supporters of Israel.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between Israel and Palestine, where a wrong creates another wrong in an endless cycle of violence and lie at the root of all, the greed of individuals and their desire to gain power in the world?
We have to tell the difference between ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because just like us, international bankers have offered to people in elections that their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of politician fascisant, loyal toward international bankers, who are keen to start a war with Iran, which could, because of the country's accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization - China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc... spread to become a global conflict and, as Iran control the Strait of Hormuz through which 20% of all the world's oil - the naval corridor has a width of 2 miles and lead to destruction of the world economy.
In what light now appear to be the words of David Rockefellers in 1994: "the only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A domain in which a handful of aristocrats of world finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every new born is located at birth an electronic chip making him be totally controlled.
"They require all individuals, large and small, rich and poor, free and slave to bear on the hand or the front a red mark iron, so that he cannot buy or sell anyone who is not the name of this savage beast or a figure of his name.
We must understand: as that of common sense in the figures of this savage beast.
This number is human and is six hundred and sixty six."
The film ARGO: when everything is worse, called Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators composed of Islamist students took over the US Embassy in Tehran and retint hostage 52 diplomats.
They were freed in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which supported his regime for decades.
The situation did not offer to the US administration to positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have severely undermined the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was able to secure the release of hostages.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, blow later compounded by the failure of the attempt to release the hostages by force.
Diplomats kidnapped were eventually released 444 days later, following the talks held by the Algerian Government.
Their fate inspired the United States a wave of solidarity and a feeling anti-iranien.
The debacle Iranian contributed greatly to the Jimmy Carter lost to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film ARGO, the actor and Director Ben affleck scene, described an episode of this story that offer a small victory to America.
Just before it was occupied, six employees échappèrent from the embassy.
After the turns complicated, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran through coverage outlandish: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a team of making repérages come for the set of a film set in great spectacle of science fiction.
Gender mix
The plan of exfiltration expert Tony Mendez requit collaboration of Hollywood.
To make the legend more credible, specialized magasines did state of this film project, presses conferences were held and a production company shadow was real offices.
The details of the operation remained a secret, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
The film of affleck is a strange combination of various kinds.
It is a part of a political thriller designed realistically but also a "caper movie ', the story of a successful coup, a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy ocean' s Eleven store, twelve and thirteen.
The documentary style ambiances move: sequences in Tehran - in the subtitled sequences are presented photographs iconiques from the days of events and how, thanks to these pictures, these cases have been recorded in the film, there are no major differences -
The passages lighter Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration,
And the scenes of the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions with men costumés discussing the situation around Conference tables in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben affleck managed to restart his career remarkably well.
An actor derided, it has become a respected director stage and her game player has continued to raise ironic comments.
ARGO is his third long-métrage after the dark police 'gone baby gone 2007 "and the thriller" the from 2010".
It is also the first film affleck that did not take place in his home city of Boston.
The atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that propelled his early films above Hollywood standards.
ARGO affleck also shows that sense of atmosphere in which the role of Tehran is held by Canada.
The best scenes of the film are in the streets, in the reconstruction of facts; the original sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity that also suggests the confusion and the unpredictability that occur when suddenly, in a given place, is writing a page of history.
Affleck and his colleagues have a similar effect in the fictional scenes - the wrong team set in Tehran's bazaar.
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to settle for a point, with so little scenes palpitantes scene, in the film sense.
He is doing very well, sometimes it adds some elements to reality and here, the result is not always as elegant - the scene in which the threat of crisis at the airport in Tehran is sidelined by a telephone call in America and the continued on the runway landing are quite drawn by the hair.
The weakness of ARGO lies in its nature dissipated, due to the need to show too many events in too many places.
It is true that Alan arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role of coopérateurs Hollywood, their characters would have earned a place more, far from it, and it is not alone.
The film affleck lack a bit of dramatic tension, it is do with a moderate interest, appreciating the achievement and the style rétro in the 1970s.
It brings the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of unfinished story, in a way, to this day, and as the exaggerated illustration of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscients, it is the case.
The rules for inflating balloons, bananas and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com absurd, leading a public inquiry into banking fees every year, has now decided to launch the competition of regulation or ideas from "the absurd EU 'workshop.
"The fact that the EU plan, recently, to adopt a quota of 40 per cent of women on the boards of large European companies was at the root of our decision," said to the newspaper právo the organiser of this investigation, Patrik nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there are already, for example, the recent decision by the European Court to unify the insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, however, the women at an were advantage in terms of tariffs on life insurance because they represent, objectively, a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any idea also incredible "the workshop of the EU."
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," has informed nacher.
Among the controversial regulations in the EU is, for example, the obligation to add organic components for fuel, the consequences of which are harmful to the environment, or a ban on using the reliable mercury thermometers, just because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance and the Directive on the size of cages of hens, which led to the increase in the price of eggs.
Criticism has also been levelled in the past against the ban on use of the phrase "butter," or the withdrawal of the sale of traditional bulbs.
Quality bananas must have a size 14 centimetres.
The EU administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually held in Brussels by a state or a group of states - the Czech Republic is currently the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto.
The interests of lobbyists are also responsible for the fact that, for example, in the Union, bananas should not be of a size below 14 cm or present a "abnormal curvature."
The European Commission defended itself by saying she was that harmonize not uniform national standards that have complicated trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables were relaxed despite the opposition of some States, claiming that the existing directives are a waste of food.
The first prize will be awarded in this investigation to EU regulation last year that should be on the balloons gonflables a warning that children under 8 years of age should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has made reference to a US investigation that the balloons are among the toys, the leading cause of death of children by choking.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 to blow in the flourish of trumpets of rat.
Here too, there were some strange ideas.
Following the rule regarding the European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece, anyone with an official function in the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and should, instead, talk of FYROM - train Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
In conjunction with the association "let go" consisting of liberal economists, the server bankovnípoplatky.com appointed in this investigation, in addition to some nonsense mentioned above, the Union's rules on the size of reserves of food on the territory of Czech Republic.
The EU has set the maximum amounts for supplies of food may be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our membership of the EU.
The Czech Republic dépassa then, for example, the volume set for canned mushrooms and risqua, resulting in a heavy fine.
The organisers of this investigation found interesting idea to give money to some countries because they have no access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to ask grants.
Those ideas, however, are not from Brussels and Prague.
"The fact of not having to sea we handicaps.
We will ask the European Union a reimbursement." So said, in the autumn of 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav palas - čssd.
He arguait because of our production of wheat, and following the purchases as "interventionist," the state had recovered with full stocks and then had to export.
According to palas, the EU would have had to pay millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the request and Czech organisa a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Subsidies to obtain subsidies were offered to the Commons by the Ministry of Local Development led by the Minister Pavel němec - us-deu - they should serve to draw up specific requests to grant from Brussels.
The EU says: "The bizarre regulations are rare."
If the regulations are often criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, efforts by the EU with regard to regulation and improving the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union and in the area of his overall development, deserve more praise.
More serious is, for example, according to the experts, the issue of the use of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which were imposed by the Member States in the budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic will, like other EU countries in Brussels, fighting for the right to use the specific names for these traditional products - does not always wins fight it raises strong emotions among the Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs have successfully defended the title "olomoucké tvarůžky," for which the name "tuzemský rum" dating back home in the 19th century, our producers have been replaced by the name "tuzemák."
Only the products of cane sugar, alcohol and not made from sugar beet, can carry the name of rum.
In the EU's official list of registered products, is now internationally known as the feta cheese company or the gorgonzola, the massepain Lübeck or Parma ham, the biscuits karlovy vary 'karlovarské suchary', the 'pohořelický třeboň carpes pohořelice and has třeboňský kapr' and 'žatecký žatec hops chmel'.
The bread of épice pardubice 'pardubický perník' and the cakes called "hořice cornets" - "hořické trubičky 'community can be proud of their brand.
People want to save the Republic, but I am just an amateur, is Senator okamura
The Senator, how was the idea to stand in the presidential elections?
This is not to be Senator or President line.
If everything works without problems in our country, I would not candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer see as the country has been plundered for the last 20 years that the thieves are not behind bars and taxes and increasing the retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But when I see something that does not feel happy, then I try to find a solution for that change.
And as I have over 40 years and that I am independent, a member of any party, I have no other options for influencing the situation to stand in presidential elections or sénatoriales.
You entered the Senate but you put quickly en route to the castle - n.d.t.: headquarters of the Presidency.
Is that how you do not turn our backs on those who elected you?
I have always said that I will launch in the battle for the castle in the election results sénatoriales
Later, I said that if I were elected Senator, I would in the presidential elections.
My aim is not the function, it is merely a tool allowing me to take my vision.
That is why I need to influence the greatest and the mandate the wider.
The problem is not just that as a nation we râlons during or before the television, but it is also that we are stalling everybody who try to make the change.
There is also the press fragmenting the reputation of individuals and confuses freedom of speech and freedom of lying.
It has, for example, said to the point that I soudoie journalists or that I was the adviser Jiří Paroubek.
Turning to your views.
You started the fight for the castle with pet themes of material and criminal responsibility by politicians and retroactive tax returns over 20 million... to CZK.
You need for this change the law.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you solve this problem?
When as a citizen, I have lobbied for the activities of tourist guide is a liberal profession, I have prevailed.
The problem is the politicaillerie: when someone comes from left to right with a good project, it is deliberately refused and it delays the citizens.
As independent, a member of any party, I have a greater chance of support from all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of power, without categorisation and dogma supporters, take each party what is best for our country and put it into effect.
You feel more like a man of right or left?
For the Czech, I have the impression that people would rather have left.
For me, that is a little to the left or right, it is not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we move ahead.
What matters to me, it is not that people are left or right but in bringing people together.
I still support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I act impartially as against bad ideas.
Do you enragez when someone tells you that you are a populist?
But does it prove not what you said?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you have a certain optimal goal and a vision.
You try to bring.
Some may call it populism, but all proposals above have been applied by the world and recognised experts have spoken.
But without the support of Parliament, we only have you slogans.
You do not survivrez long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you see people and talk to them, you will, for example, impose material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I must convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to rally them to my camp to impose it.
If I am elected President, this would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they do not want it.
When there is a strong personality that will identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the election of the President in direct elections, it was created by the pressure of public opinion.
I am, quite clearly, an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I have to engage in politics and I am trying to get the majority support for my programme.
Only, I try to make things happen, and if it does not work, I stop in six years ago and I return to the private sector.
It is as if okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that one person cannot make a difference, so I went to see a number of people to ask them to stand for election sénatoriales.
I met radim jančura, but he refused because of the volume of work.
At least, I supported the investigative journalist Jana lorencová which revealed fraud with oil.
I came because people are really dissatisfied but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of people did not vote and what did have, for the most part, given their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
People choose a senate that will hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I am on my vision, for example the election committed by direct election of Mayors and the chiefs of regions.
Do you have your own party?
No, not yet, because I do not have time to check whether the past of each potential Member is clean and then I don't have the money.
I have no money for my campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my account "transparent."
You do not have any money?
You talk about tax returns, what is yours?
I believe to some 60 million the value of my personal property.
I have a ground in Prague worth $25 million, an apartment worth $10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth around 10 million, are we to a Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Skoda superb worth $1 million and a few million on my account.
Incidentally, I have a Aston Martin, because it was a childish dream: I have always liked James Bond, roulait in cars, was galant with women and fought against the evil and abuse.
You roulez Aston Martin, you have a heritage worth $60 million and you have no money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you do not want to invest your own money?
This is not very convincing.
I have not 15 million for this campaign.
I should go into debt?
I have already spent two and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my programme does not generate great interest.
I do not have the obligation to pay this campaign in my pocket.
My campaign costs are covered by the overall pay that I receive as a senator.
But I could not live on, for example, pay the English school for my son who is 30 thousand per month.
If my only goal was to make money, I am not present in any election.
You will therefore continue your trade to live?
Did you said that you would your activities be putting a damper?
But that is not linked to the amount of the payment.
As I promised, I was partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take the leadership of the spring travel agency.
People would like I am a Samaritan who save the Republic.
Yet while I can live for something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were entrepreneur?
I gagnais and I continue to earn between two and four hundred thousand.
If I were President, I would end my business activities.
You will find this interview in Saturday's edition of the Journal práva.
The architects of the cabinet mvrdv show that the real adventure is not just about imagination. To be persuaded, just watch spijkenisse and the mountain of newly built books - 2 photos
"I think that this building is marrant, it is very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette verhaig, a passante aside in the street.
Stefan spermon nearby, a computer programmer in a large company, says: "Yes, it is good, this building."
But now I wonder why we still need a library.
Everyone has Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Now, nobody will yourself in one of these elderly libraries, no?
Spijkenisse, ville-dortoir is not attractive to the gates of Rotterdam, holds a record quite particular.
The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest levels of education in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons in the brain, a few years ago, the city decided to contribute to the general culture and replicate the seven bridges shadow that appear on the ticket of euros in the form of pretty small toy airtight armed painted.
The success of the offensive cultural remained limited.
That is how the authorities in the city have realised that there was only one way to take the hand on the statistics: the construction of a library.
Winy Maas, office's architects of Rotterdam mvrdv, master of charts in bold sticks and creator of buildings full of spirit and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual flegme and presented the competition in 2003 with five books under my arm and a ricanement on the face.
And while the members of the jury is still looked bewildered and haussant the shoulders, the effronté Maas empila its books of choice in order of size for a pyramid, and termina his speech arguments activists underpinned by a common: "dear!"
There it is, my proposal for the mountain of spijkenisse books, or as they say, the boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million has bounced from earth.
The building is part of a revitalization project with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and houses mitoyennes for a total of 50 homes.
In early November, the mountain of books has received the second price "best library of NL 2012."
In addition, the project has been selected for the Dutch national wood award 2012.
That is how this small village dull, which up to now had nothing more to offer than a post-modern piétonne area and a City Hall a staggering laideur, whose facades white invite to think they contain laiterie, have been supplemented by a contemporary architectural practice.
The most important is that spijkenisse now has the first public building cultural history.
The long road to the reading
First impression: Eldorado book under glass to cheese.
Certainly, a lift transports you to the heart of the massive, but the real joy of reading and architecture are open to you when you foulez soil of the building to the discovery of his topographie.
The Interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch soil on bricks and go the elegant réverbères clearly speak the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
It is already looking at the public benches, dogs and boys and girls who play the ball.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, the library shelves are along the coast and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," explains Willy Maas.
We have completely changed the configuration classical space and open spaces for reading from the inside to the outside world.
Inside the mountain of books has been skilfully developed: in the middle are the offices, the Internet, the Club of technical failures, the Centre for environment and the central library building.
A special beauty lies in the library, which are sometimes lambris, sometimes balustrades black shelves and bridges of stairs.
A new experience for the view, the touch and the odorat.
Even hardened the architects and engineers building materials do not unknown.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains joop trouborst, head of the project to the common spijkenisse, in a response to the standard.
So one day we found in an ad hoc Friesian Farm waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, is used for years to the synthetic membrane one millimetre thick as substrate in the greenhouses and fields.
It is cheap and we win over time.
The fine membrane is used for one or two seasons, then we can throw it away.
For the library, the membrane was compressée, for the first time in such quantities, sclerosis four centimetres thick.
Because of the heat and pressure, the "landbouwplastic kpl" exchange of colour and turns into a dark material, consistent and resilient, whose smell evokes both a new car and sport shoes.
At the top of the 105 walks is the top of the mountain.
After nearly 500 metres, the coffee literary gives us a view like an untouchable on the city, but also of Dutch croquettes and ficus go in pots.
They create an atmosphere, but they especially ideal for maintaining the level of moisture in the air of the literary mountain.
Donations to the new Soul
"It is incredible, but despite all the areas of glass, this building is a model project on ecology," gives trouborst.
The temperature of the edifice is regulated by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is under a glass of glass, the sun is shining upon him there that much time inside, even the days of good weather.
The épaisses wooden beams which were mounted wrong on the facade of glass used pare-soleil, listening much of the shelves.
The current mood is very pleasant.
The blinds fully automated can do the rest.
Stefan spermon, the aforementioned computer programmer septique, has already threatened to enter the new library.
Lisette verhaig also was already there.
Cynthia bogarde, even the boekenberg professeure Chinese traditional medicine, described as "the soul finally found" spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago at the inauguration, every citizen has been invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This has helped to fill the gaps in the library, which was not yet fully garnie - today it counts 70,000 books.
The concept is a success.
The shelves are full of all sides.
For the architect winy Maas," there is nothing worse than a library half empty."
"I believe that our invitation has created some relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it is only for the decoration."
That is how mvrdv reached discipline trump referred to in the professional jargon," creating an identity."
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Although it may seem young and poorly educated.
It is finally a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role."
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen szabo, expert in relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a difficult political situation.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had announced his intention to vote against the Palestinians' request to obtain the status of observer state at the United Nations.
But she then decided to abstain.
Why?
Stephen szabo: Germany does not approve what Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be careful, because it has a special relationship with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the US position.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also abstained in the vote on the establishment of an air exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposa this measure.
Germany finds difficult to take a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is currently revising its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy virtually defined by the Americans and to have a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of coherent policy and common within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are so on several fronts.
We expect them to play a more independent role, but they are not used.
I think they tâtonnent still to find this role, but are on the path to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Britain
That means when actually the end of "normal" foreign policy for the Germans?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions outside the United States and the European partners, including the national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is determined by its economic policy, so by exports and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
These economic interests have influenced Germany's position towards the Middle East conflict and to abstain in the UN vote?
Germany was first to important markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to hurt the public, but also the elites of Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a deciding factor.
However, I do not accorderais too much importance, because it is not exclusively unilateral relationship.
But it is at least a deciding factor in the German strategic considerations.
Germany nuit-elle to its relations with the United States by choosing the abstention of important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I believe that Europeans and Americans understand perfectly the German position.
That is why I think the gap is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan issue.
Perhaps that Germany will be respected.
Indeed, Germany has been demonstrated that it should be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, the views on the Palestinian initiative are different.
By contrast, the United States announced their veto of a clear voice.
Opinions differ between the United States and most European countries?
There have always been differences because of American domestic politics.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly very understanding towards the European position.
But given the country's political configuration of course, the government cannot defend his position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so big that they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from breaks of enthusiasm for Netanyahu's policy.
Germany finds difficult to reconcile his close relations with Israel and the United States, with the position of the major European partners, on the other hand?
I think it is not an easy for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a single, coherent European policy, but that is not the case today.
So they cannot be in a broader political line and must say their unique position.
They are currently in the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will in future a leading role and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, especially because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been difficult.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role which is more independence.
Germany to work is a role player on the international stage, Germany is only assume a key role?
Or is always difficult to play leading roles?
Germany is still not used, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a more important role.
If you look, for example, the crisis of the euro, we notice that every time Germany decides to throw more, many feelings antiallemands are heard.
It is not an easy for the Germans.
In fact, it is always a problem: we do not want to be surrounded by force of between hostile countries.
In this view, Germany is in a far worse position than the United States.
It must deal with the neighbours and differing opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the United States' influence on European policy continues to diminish, but at the moment, the EU does not fill this vacuum, then who is left?
The Germans will simply play a more important role.
And even if they do not like, even if it is unpleasant and if they are only less popular, this is life!
Stephen szabo is Deputy Director of the transatlantic Academy of Washington, an institute in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America are the challenges of the transatlantic community together.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialises in German politics, in American foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
"Protection of trademarks in China: when Puma and Armani become suddenly Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph lauren trademarks are known throughout the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really?
Behind the name is officially a trademark in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company.
The brand and has a protection as the company that bears the name could not complain.
And even if it could, it is not certain that it would be successful.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," explains Thomas pattloch, lawyer cabinet Taylor wessing specialised in violation of property rights in the Far East.
Each week, a new dossier arrives on my desk.
The imitateurs only need a few extra letters to register their brands.
So, instead of Gucci are lu-gucci, and instead of Prada are prada-kny.
German companies are also copy legally, as PUMA, the manufacturer of sports equipment.
Pattloch opens a classeur where are the recordings made with the Trade Mark Office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company has submitted the brand zegna df PUMA, a name that the firm has artificially created by availing themselves part of the name of ermenegildo zegna, home of fashion.
It is known that the Chinese have become the champions of the world of copying and the violation of intellectual property.
In cities, there are several étages shopping centres that do sell almost that of counterfeits.
The case of pattloch are different, however: its principals the task of addressing the fact that the Chinese Trade Mark Office by officially for Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "bang mingpai brand," relative.
The term is derived from "bang dakuan."
It is with this term that are designated women who are married to men rich.
The Chinese authorities say have nothing to blame.
"This is bad for business, we have to fight this trend," requires pattloch.
"The brand is diluted, the uniqueness disappears, the damage to the reputation are enormous."
The financial losses and legal costs running into millions for the sectors, especially with regard to the expensive flagship products.
According to data from the society of market analysis clsa, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third world market for luxury goods and that the fastest growing.
However, it is not easy to delete the dubious recordings of the register of brands and these procedures are expensive.
They can last up to nine years, and the outcome is not certain.
Pattloch mentions the trial in which the Court has rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticised had become a "market reality."
Pattloch tells us that if the complainant has no chance, it may even be forced to pay money to plagiaire, because it would have interfered with its brand in China.
In this area, sometimes it is the law of the jungle prevails.
Famous cases are graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the manufacturer of machine project sany, the same company that had to buy the manufacturer of pumps to concrete putzmeister.
That is why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely used before a blue and white logo, who complained that BMW, Volvo's acquisiteur. The conflict was resolved and Geely gave the change.
The home of fashion Lacoste had lost against the plagiaires of Hong Kong and Singapore who had turned the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are guilty of nothing.
The office of brands ctmo in Beijing recognizes having some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the Office rose last year to an "emergency situation in the course of the work to a normality restored."
Thus, the number of cases of untreated opposition would have fallen by 22%.
Almost 57,000 cases of this kind would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% over the previous year.
However, 81,500 procedures remain outstanding in the office.
Operating costs
As so often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the ctmo received more than 1.4 million applications received marks, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, it is a record and this means that China is at the top of the list for the tenth time running for the number of new deposits in the world.
It is also for legal, which is the total number of brands of 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office would have counted 1.8 billion yuan of registration law.
In other words, each recording reported on average 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle is much more, as illustrated by the case of the German freudenberg family business.
For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese plagiaire.
Certainly, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of components of vehicle is suspended.
However, the Chinese imitateur has maintained its rights on the brand freudenberg.
"This is our fault, because the names of families cannot be protected in Germany," explains hanno wentzler, President of the direction of freudenberg chemical specialities in Munich.
The office of brands had rejected the objection of Munich.
Freudenberg may have had their way with the next two bodies, but the other side continues to fight until today.
The vigilant
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of judges.
However, he adds: "It is a long process, demanding and costing us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess the internal costs and the service records even had to review the actions of the past hundred years to give evidence.
Five years ago, freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the other side a "large amount in euros to six figures" to resolve the dispute.
"That is what we see what this means for us," gives wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to spill over to Europe.
This would be the case if imitateurs of this region is assuring the exploitation of brands unprotected.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer wants to table in Germany's name freudenberg for a production company to shoe and leather.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the submission.
Wentzler adds: "The vigilant."
Pattloch and advise him to German companies to exercise great caution in trade relations with China.
It is not enough, they say, to rely on international law trademarks, outsiders should instead "record in China which is likely to be protected," as wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs can be much higher than those of the recording.
Indeed, if freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay a licence fee to the opposite side for the use of her name, as is wentzler.
Alternatively, we lose our place on the market segment.
World AIDS Day: put your foot, singing, help
The chorale imbongi repeat in Heidelberg, Swaziland's AIDS orphans and welcome their arrival.
Here is the story of a link that takes more than a distance of 8,733 kilometres.
First, the kicking foot: cowboy's boots, the trainers, the escarpins for the ladies and the mocassins for men seeking the pace by striking the ground on foot; very fast, they found.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voice singers will increase slowly - low, tenor and Alto soprano - they win, envoûtent and continue.
Fiete hopf, the web when he leads the orchestra conductor 29 years almost loses his shoes with his moves wild flexibility.
We are on Monday evening, the chorale imbongi said a new song in the music room of the Institute of medical psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty chanteuses and chanteurs from 23 to 69 came, the généticienne in human medicine to people at home.
"Om' obani" is not an easy piece, every choriste has different words, all in a language very exotic: the zoulou, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Be helped to help
UNAIDS, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are living with the disease.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland account 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans in the village of esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany with the association "voices for Africa."
70 of them attend a secondary education institution.
For 15 or 20 euros for less, you can become Godfather.
That guarantees the child sum of money for school, a school uniform and a hot meals daily at the centre gogo.
Imbongi zoulou mean "conteur stories" or even "singer of praise."
No one can speak the language fluently bantoue in this region, but everyone can sing.
For nearly 10 years, the chorale repeat songs in this foreign language she led in Germany for now make it to his home region, South Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometres from bird of Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland is esitjeni, the village voice which depends on the power of the German chorale.
40% of sufferers
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest huttes of straw or land and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has won their parents.
At esitjeni, can be seen on a smaller scale the ills in Swaziland, the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population is almost never the male circumcision, a measure which ensures a proven reduction of the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the people of Swaziland holds the immunodeficiency virus and it is not unusual to die in the middle of the Thirties.
On a trip to group in Africa in spring 2005, the chorale had discovered the village; the imbongis mostly because many children in the street, and it was not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, school without qualifications, there is simply no prospect.
At the beginning, it was just some people who are committed to personally pay a few euros each year to send a child to school and offer them a hot meals per day.
But barely a year later, the chorale based voices for Africa, a professional association that has since almost esitjeni for AIDS orphans.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the IST bacterial, there are the syphilis chlamydiées and the blennorragie - or gonorrhée.
The current ist have HIV, the virus from the human papillome herpès génital or hepatitis.
The pubis poux parasite and the IST gale belong to rocket.
What are the main groups concerned?
The syphilis and blennorragie often appear among men who have sex with other men.
The Institute robert-koch believes that the sexual contact between men have led to at least four out of five cases of syphilis declared in Germany.
Among adults, heterosexual infections linked to chlamydiées, the trichomonase, the candidose - fongique - the blennorragie and the virus of human papillome are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV between heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany; however, some 20% of new HIV infections occur in that group.
Among young people, is a rate of infections related to chlamydiées significantly higher than among other ethnic groups.
According to European records, three quarters of all infections involve young people aged 15 to 25 years.
In addition, in Germany, the human virus of papillome is common among young people.
What is the change in the number of infections?
It is not compulsory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the institute robert-koch syphilis, the number of cases has more than doubled in 10 years, the figure has risen from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections is declining.
In 2011, there have been about 2,700 case.
This represents a decrease of 10% compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
Infectious diseases can cause of air in the genital organs at bas-ventre urinary, white loss, the pain, the pain and the appearance of buttons and verrues.
However, they do regularly no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infection lubrifiante or close physical contact.
Experts recommend to anyone taking regular exams often changing sexual partners.
Most of the IST quickly dépistées can be cured and the late injuries can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorship, donations, but especially the funds reap the choristes thanks to their voice throughout the whole of Germany, the means are mounting.
"In all, we have already sent around esitjeni 200,000 euros," says Annette lennartz, President of the Association.
The village, zodwa Dlamini, a woman sure of itself and which always gets what it wants, manages money from Germany.
It also ensures that the orphans are well housed, in one of their grand-mères for example.
The gogos zoulou, is known as the old women, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them receive up to 14 orphans, they offer them a roof and ensure that every day when they go to school in their uniforms.
The orphan who has no person is received in a safe place, among khanyisile, a woman living alone and is paid by the association, as the two cooks preparing meals each day for more than 200 starving children.
In addition," voices for Africa "has created a school of couture and allowed the construction of two hen's eggs, with the help of the American Health Organisation PSI, the association held an HIV test for many people.
It is not a given, because even if the disease is visible across the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and his 14 wives
"This is a real taboo," Annette lennartz explains, "because it is something that affects the sexuality."
It is rather curious, coming from a country where the King has 14 wives official.
Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King mswati III, is known for its excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy in place of democracy.
These habits sanctioned by the state, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also dispersed the virus in the country.
But there are condoms on every street corner, Annette lennartz adds," but almost nobody uses.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh."
To encourage some cultural exchange, the choristes imbongi go in all journey together with two or three years in South Africa and entonnent chanting full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and identity that black population of the continent's leading black still have time to apartheid.
The bus full of white singing in African language is a sign of recognition as it brings not only good humour and joy, but severs sometimes a larme some formidable gardes-frontière.
The bus takes always esitjeni, where the choristes visiting their godchildren.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, esitjeni ezulweni is well known in the valley.
"Go to esitjeni, you will find the light," say the people there.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometres from bird, returning to Heidelberg, before these choristes that pat's foot in the repeat of the room bergheimer straße, there is also the light.
Messenger: NASA discovered the presence of ice on mercury
The tube messenger reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet mercury.
The ice cover could reach 20 metres thick.
The US Space Agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the sun, it contains water ice, as explained in three studies published Thursday in the journal Science specialist.
The tube messenger reported evidence of the existence of a blanket of ice in the region of the world permanently immersed in the shadows.
This coverage would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters of up to 20 metres.
Water is probably comètes or perhaps astéroïdes have encountered mercury.
However, there is a link between the discovery of water and the possibility of a presence of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the tube messenger Sean Solomon.
The temperature on mercury can achieve 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help explain how the water and other essential elements to life arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Invisible people on our planet, the sondes, telescopes and small robots as Phoenix seeking the depths of the universe.

This detail of a photograph taken by the infrared telescope Spitzer shows a "family portrait" countless generations of stars: older stars are blue and pink ones, are harder to identify the "newborn" in the room of birth of the universe.
The telescope Spitzer discovered this region which produce the stars, called w5 ', a name little romantic, in the constellation of cassiopée, 6,500 années-lumière.
The flamboyant Spitzer NASA telescope photographed the sparkle of a dying star.

One of the great conundrums of Astronomy is the creation of the rings of Saturn.
One theory is that the rings were the remains of a moon of Saturn 4.5 billion years ago who disappeared without trace.
One of the largest and most photographs net that has taken the Hubble telescope is the galaxy's maelstrom.
As a result, the photographs of galaxies spirales can become real works of art.
A photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the black trifide in the constellation of sagittaire, thousands of années-lumière.
Trifide's name comes from the Latin word "trifidus divided, divided into three" dust, as three dragged divide the core luisant the birthplace of stars.
The astronomes have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic carambolage in the constellation of serpentaire: to 400 million light years away from Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies in merger rush towards each other, the collision is unavoidable.
The Hubble telescope was the birth of the stars in the galaxy m83 spiral.
If you do not like the abbreviations technical, you can use its nickname of "wheel of southern light."
The photograph of the Hubble space telescope shows a detail of the cloud of year the, Iris, in the constellation of céphée.
The cloud is at 1,400 années-lumière and is composed of dust grains that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the standard household dust.
This photo was developed from the clichés and optical radiographiques made by various télescopes.
You can see the circle consisting of black holes which is at 430 million light years away from earth.

Scientists believe that he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main télescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans lipperhey, before Galileo the utilisât a year later to see the stars.
Since then, the mirrors optical telescopes have not continued to swell and thanks to them, it was possible to see still further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the telescope hale observatory on Mount palomar near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on the image had a diameter of five metres.
In Arizona, the United States, is the broad binocular telescope.
It allows us to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The belly of the Gran telescopio canarias to La Palma in the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reached a diameter of 10,4 metres.
The mirror's southern African broad telescope in South Africa has been broken up in order to save money.
The diameter is still around 11 metres.
The downside of the economic construction method is that the telescope is set in the vertical angle, which limits their mobility.
The telescope hobby-eberly in Texas is also set in the vertical angle.
Its uniqueness lies in its great capacity for collection of light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to those of larger télescopes mirrors in the world.
The scientists understand the universe in search of signals extra-terrestres with the radio to arecibo - Puerto Rico.
The radio has a diameter of 305 metres.

With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can enlighten the infrared spectrum means.
The construction of a huge telescope European the European extremely wide telescope is also planned for the site of the things in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 metres. It will consist of about 1,000 elements of mirrors.
However, the telescope will take clichés until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two télescopes keck on the volcano hawaïen of Mauna KEA were regarded as the world's largest.
They held two mirrors with a diameter of 10 metres each.
Telescopes of keck telescope makers are part of the centre of Mauna KEA who observed the sky with the telescope subaru and the irtf.
A new giant telescope should be built on the Mauna KEA and the diameter of its mirror reaches 30 metres.

Scientists believe that the South Pole of mercury is also ice.
However, there is no reliable data on this theory, because messenger mercury orbit much closer to the North Pole.
For decades the radar data indicated the presence of ice on mercury.
With the launch of the probe Messenger in 2004, the first to orbiter around mercury, scientists now have the certainty.

In southern Azerbaijan, many people are ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.

An investigation into a country, which is still relatively young at 97 years.
The trip in the mountains talysh is unbridled romanticism.
By way of several turns of the road, the small bus cahote along wooded hills, rivers torrentiels and small farms.
Everything is green and fertile, you could almost imagine yourself in the forêt-noire.
But we are here in the deep south of the border with Azerbaijan, Iran is just a few miles away.
It is here in the Caucasian ethnic group named talysh, about which we know little, if only they speak perfectly Persian and the Azeri and they have a great life.
Destination: lerik.
The small town plastronne with its architecture too aggressive in the Soviet era that is not at all with the scenic mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, is too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 miles, because the road has only one way.
The province has still not taken advantage of the legendary wealth to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, pilata fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that lerik has the potential to become a tourist spot.
"Baku became famous in May with the assistance of the Eurovision Song Contest, and there will be here next year, the festival of older people in the world," explains fatulayeva.
She is Director of the Museum of longevity, so the only Museum in the world.
You can find the life of about eight dozen talysh of the region, which has more than 100 years. fatulayeva shows a photo in black and white.
My grandfather, he has reached the age of 120 years.
Having another child to 136 years
But the controversial star of the museum is şirali müslümov, a shepherd who had 168 years.
There is however no birth certificates.
And if you think that the oldest person documented had 122 years, the age of müslümov seems very doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and it would have been 23 children and at the age of 136, it would still have conceived a daughter.
şIrali müslümov would have mistaken for decades when calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, gérontologue the Institute max-planck Rostock, he has also heard of the man with the great age of Central Asia.
"Surprisingly older people also live in parts of China, Japan or the hunza Valley in Pakistan," explains Scholz, "in Sardinia too, there are men who are incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish a scientific evidence because of the lack of documents, not to mention that there was no record of marital status.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
But the fact is that the people of the region to lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the south of the country?
Farid mugimzadeh Azeri, the tourist guide, explains that the talysh have special genes.
By contrast, fatulayeva, the director of the museum, believes that it is a question of food.
However, it does not seem likely, from a nutritional point of view, that the meals rich in calories of talysh, who like meat, bread and especially dairy products and many daily drink a glass of melted butter, are good for the health.
Or is it just the way of life that preserves the young people? In cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of lerik, live rubaba mirzayeva.
With its 97 years, it is still relatively new to the region.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest home of wood, as is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the floor next to a baratte, she beats the content tirelessly.
Eight people live here mirzayeva under one roof, including a son and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two small children gambadent also in the House.
In the kitchen, it prepares tea for the guests served in glasses armadus typical form of belly.
The mirzayeva white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his scarf hiding many tresses a dark blond, that his son shows with pride.
I always washed my hair with milk, and that is how I have never lost the and they have kept their colour.
"I have never used shampoo," adds mirzayeva.
The monthly pension is enough to live
It has always eaten what comes from its own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then, she talks about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything has improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the lead.
The language of the propaganda surprises in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the nation's paternal figure, a man who has led his country as a dictator, has almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He has been in power until 2003, his son Ilham him subsequently they installed later swept.
However, the elderly of Azerbaijan does not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives month 230 manats - about the same amount in euros - for retirement, a sum which guarantees a good lifestyle in the region.
And perhaps the son long grisonnant mirzayeva is right: "the Elders enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the centre of the family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
"Human rights" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution has surfaced in Cairo.
Rival events reveal the deep divide in the country.
The draft Constitution based on Sharia is violently controversial.
Egyptian President does not stint on words more excitement.
We must manage the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was for the nation as a whole, and especially the Coptic Christians, the Liberal, enlightened Muslim and secular.
Because all confused and hopelessly divided opposition members are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy in the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed morsi said, almost as if apologise, having temporarily restricted the powers of the constitutional court and broadened its own "to save the Revolution."
However, the Egyptians and the world really do not know what will save the engineer of 61 years, American holds a doctorate from the University of southern California.
The judiciary be toppled?
The 234 articles hastily drafted by a constituent assembly overwhelmingly Islamic night of 100 people in a tour de force of 15 hours are worrisome to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, under the draft law is based on the principles of Islamic law.
But what is really the word "principles"?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague wording and the ensuing legal leeway to implement a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
In any case is that suggests a newly introduced Article stating that, on all matters relating to the Sharia, the university al-Azhar must be consulted and the establishment is the country's most important Islamic institution and its lustre rayonne Sunni throughout the Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative process, which would de facto the subjugation of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely continuation of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts are employèrent to repress opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The state must also protect, we read in the project," the true nature of the Egyptian family "and" promote the morals and values. "
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the institutions of the State can even control the content of the art cinema and literature.
Clearly, it is simply censorship.
In addition, no article explicitly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead of that, another rule prohibits of offending or defame the prophet Mohammed or his envoys.
However, the rule does not define what constitutes an offence or how it should be punished.
Equally questionable is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to offend people."
Enough to develop a caricature of President or tell a joke at the expense of a man of law?
Many points are subject to interpretation in the draft that morsi puts the vote and who, in his own words, will "very soon" subject to a referendum among Egyptians.
"The revolution returns'
The opposition is protesting for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
Friday evening, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual concord in Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to topple the sharia before it comes into force.
"The revolution has surfaced and we will win," launches hamdin sabbahi, came third in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize and ex-chef of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei has said that the draft Constitution is "to throw in the dustbin of history."
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused the supporters of morsi to stage a coup against democracy."
"If he says the referendum, we will go to the palace and it will reverse if exclame jasser said, an opponent.
"We are still not tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expié," according to the Egyptian media said Khaled Ali, a politician and a member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges have said not to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its annulment.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
For its part, the Muslim Brotherhood, well organised, called for a contre-manifestation not in Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer was organised at the University of Cairo.
Headscarved women and the supporters of the Salafi, who took part in large numbers, scandaient: "the people demand the application of the law of God."
Fully "clean out our country!" demandaient-ils morsi, saying: "the Koran... was their constitution."
A battle for sovereignty over the symbolic place tharir, where everything began soon, would have created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Of course, this is what the supporters of morsi wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents of the draft Constitution, as his supporters, had spoken loud and clear.
For them, it is now time to let the people decide through the ballot box in the direction of the country.
The project of Islamists win certainly the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once '
Hafez Abu saeda is angry with the constitutional process imposed which was due to run until February and include all social forces.
This human rights lawyer of 48 years and President of the Egyptian organisation for human rights - eohr had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in the courts under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shares their view of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That is why it was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now, the end is not even mentioned once in the new Constitution," regrette-t-il during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of the powers of morsi the three powers has discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and they will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, de facto president him away all its powers," laments saeda.
However, a democracy can function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, which considers the battle between the various political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could afford.
A demonstrator on the place tharir warns: "You accouchez a monster that you will not possible to monitor."
The rakfisk Norway: is this the most odorant fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway enjoy some of the highest levels of life, not just in Europe, but also in the world.
The secret of the success of the country could be linked to local 'appetite for a fish extremely odorant?
Take advanced cheeses.
Placez-les soccer in the middle of a pile of clothes wet and dirty.
Wait a week.
And you get the smell disturbing the rakfisk, one of the most popular put Norway.
I am in the small town of fagernes, at around 3 p.m. in Oslo.
The snow, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, ubiquitous, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt truite spread too thinly and fermentée in water for a period - according to the smell that you want it exhale - which can go up to a year.
When it is cold and darkness descending, the Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival which is taking place here in fagernes, devoted to this incredible culinary speciality.
"You mangez believed, then you avalez a glass of aquavit," explains havard halvarsen, a local fireman to full time also known as "rakfisk general," responsible for the management of the festival.
Around us, people of using small pieces of fish and enfilent a lot of drink.
"Some people prefer to aquavit rakfisk," adds havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I try a few pieces.
If you can avoid the get under your nose, it is not bad - it is reminiscent of a sushi who has spent many hours in a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of the cooling, the fish was immersed in water barriques impervious to the air, then salé in autumn.
Then, during the winter, a time of fermented fish came out and - no doubt with the sense curtailed by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, emigrating mainly down to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the full employment, the high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals that the country was not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to work.
The rakfisk is regarded as something important, vital, although odorant, of Norway's past.
This is part of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pinte beer or a sandwich you will cost 10€ each.
Norway does not often talk about it in the News International, which is not to upset.
Here, people are not prepared to talk about Anders Breivik, the racist right wing extremist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When referring to the shooting, they talk about "the incident on 22 July."
The Norwegians have difficulties with that in their peaceful countries, one of them could commit such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes his wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success," explains Anna, our serveuse, chevelure blonde and blue in the eyes of a numbing, the image of the Nordic welfare, with a plate of rakfisk in hand.
We are - how do you say - people cautious.
His English, like that of most of the people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to point out.
Norway has managed its oil wealth very carefully - and, with the exception of a small percentage of money from the industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries laid money down the drain, in the years that have led to the global financial crisis, it has kept its purse strings tight.
"As long as we can make of the randonnée skiing in winter and summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"Without forgetting the rakfisk" also says that there would be a flight in a carefree laugh.
I am standing in the snow and I am waiting to buy food - I had my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a burger consisting of momentum, a real discovery is excellent.
But this evening, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel where I is is one of many places using the rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps odorant for most of them.
There is a TV programme where the host, interviewer is a nœud-papillon rakfisk, surrounded by plates.
It is reminiscent of the collaboration of Eurovision.
"What did you give score the best fish, in the mountains thor-juergen?"
"This is our points, havard."
We hear the Laughter and applause.
A man falls to his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it is because the fish product.
The Mexican Enrique pena nieto has a difficult start.
While the incoming President Enrique pena nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, will grant, of the BBC, is the difficulties facing it and the expectations of the people, who are numerous.
Traffic to Mexico is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where the traffic jams are rife in normal times, a dam safety has been put in place since Monday, blocking several key access roads in the capital and causing a real chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to stop people from going to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching the House.
Next Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique pena nieto, will receive the presidential sash to become the new President at the helm of the nation.
Have a complicated task.
Mexico's economy is doing well, results that we need to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is facing a drug war that has already claimed the lives of around 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made the commitment to the Mexican people to reduce the violence," said Mr pena nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before we know the US President, Mr pena nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A big and sprawling binding the state capital on its prime land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A man direct
In the joint bucolique of Valle del bravo, for example, it is in everyone's memory.
The local him attribute the development of tourism and infrastructure in the joint.
To join the city, you can take one of the new highways m pena nieto, a significant improvement was made to these roads, once bosselées and full of crevasses.
The plates bearing his name are accrochées outside of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to establish lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel olvera Hernández, a member of Congress and the party of Mr pena nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we expect a real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years at full power, the PRI has been replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The member of Congress olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace in Los pinos, there are a lot of expectations within the Party about Enrique pena nieto.
It rejects the criticism from opponents who accuse the new President of a lack of charisma.
It is a whole man, very committed, with an excellent view of the country.
This is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows listen.
However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
At nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del bravo could not be more obvious.
Hidden under the autoponts motorways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of the city of Mexico.
And the problems in the city are also practical and urban.
Earlier this year, the military has been called to help in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women are particularly serious.
In a disaster area, discharge were found on the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the past two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr pena nieto Governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place notorious for the number of innocent women who have been killed.
Critics of Mr pena nieto say that, at best, it has failed to stem the problem of murders committed against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this ramshackle neighborhood, irinea buendia fight to retain his tears when she shows me pictures of his deceased daughter, Mariana luna.
The official reported a committed suicide by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family believe she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived home, I decided that his body was washed," tells the señora buendia.
Signs indicate that she had been beaten, and the rigid cadavérique had already started.
When his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana can the wall, in addition to a cross that features the word: justice.
However, that is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities have treated me as if I was an old commère, a disorder, a fautrice pleurnicheuse.
They want to accept what they say and they are silent.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President pena nieto receives his scarf Saturday, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico in the last six years and the new President has promised that it would be his top priority during his tenure.
"I hope it will be as good as President, when he was governor," said olvera, Valle del bravo, member of Congress.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of abuse, say prosecutors.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse which Bradley Manning would have suffered during the detention.
The trial is the detention of manning quantico, in a military prison in Virginia.
The defense wants to close the case on the grounds that the kidnapping of manning came in extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of having been stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Friday, prosecutors have tried to show that the soldier Bradley Manning - accused of being behind the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the US army - has missed many opportunities to complain of abuse he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
When cross-examined with manning, during a preliminary hearing to FT. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor maj. ashden Fein said that the recordings of weekly visits made to manning by officers during his nine months in prison for quantico, Virginia, have not shown any complaint about his treatment.
The contre-interrogatoire - during a hearing, the defense has presented a motion demanding that the affair manning is classified on the grounds that the kidnapping came in very difficult conditions and was a severe punishment enough - took place a day after Manning has shown his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010, is accused of having been stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that manning was their source.
At the hearing on Friday, Fein discussed with manning forms that officers had met after their meeting with manning quantico, during his detention in military prison, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers have asked questions to manning and have recorded his answers.
When Fein mentioned the forms, Friday, manning has acknowledged that the way that it has reserved its guards were "excellent" and that the treatment he had been in the prison was generally "very professional."
The forms show no complaint of abuse, even though the officers have directly asked about his prison treatment, said Fein.
Manning said he had verbally expressed concerns about some problems and the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and said that they would take, but they have not recorded the issues raised.
"They were writing" no problem "after raising concerns, but this does not mean that I was not raised to problems," said manning.
The military judge Col. Denise lind Manning has also asked why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special committee which met to discuss the suicidal thoughts that he had expressed by writing a few months ago.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change its status restrictive indicating a "risk of injury."
The military said that it had taken this Statute restrictive - a level below the close scrutiny for suicide risk - for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the staff know that I was good, and I wanted that I am being cut this Statute... to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," said manning.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer in Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the base of the Marine Corps to quantico, in Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had planned to commit suicide when he was in Kuwait and be eroded once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that we have not been kept informed of what will happen to him or to what was happening in the rest of the world was very frightening.
"My world was reduced to camp arafjon, to the cage," said manning, Thursday.
I thought that I would die in the cage.
Once clear to quantico manning said that he had spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours - without company.
Manning has also added that the only things he had had a mattress, coverage, tongs, clothes and his glasses.
He has tried to stay in motion, because sleep or remain lying during the day was against the Rules.
Manning also said that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in their eyes alight outside his cell.
If the guards were not his face when he would return at night, they so as not to see his face.
A lawyer for Manning has made a formal complaint to the treatment suffered by manning in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in strong leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also Friday, the judge asked questions to manning regarding an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday - only after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell to quantico, was forced to stand naked before the guards and other inmates one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time, he was allowed to cover themselves with coverage during the call.
During the judge's questions, manning said Friday that it had gathered from the guard in order that he should drop its coverage could hide his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to leave.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked last night, as it has tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could use his elastic slip or its tongs to be injured, but that it had not done so.
That night, manning testified that his underwear, its tongs, and his glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experience he has experienced during his detention and that it will significantly reduce her sentence if he were convicted in a court martial, a trial should be held early next year.
The Defence said that manning intends to plead guilty of the least serious crimes and to fight for abandoning other charges were considered too extreme.
The hearing will resume this weekend, with prosecutors who would argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that manning was jailed under the rules governing the detention conditions for all the detainees to quantico.
The charges brought against manning include the theft of public goods or documents, the illegal collusion with the enemy, resulting in the publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to national defense.
If any criminal charges are accepted, they incur the imprisonment in perpetuity.
My identity crisis mexico-américaine
He said that many were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those parties; they remind the Mexican difficult periods, he said.
Navarrette said the mexico-américains find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the hall, customs and immigration services before, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two paths: one for the "mexicanos" Mexican ', another for the' foreign '"extranjeros."
I stood still for several seconds, not knowing to what queue would lead.
I grew up in central California, where it was called the "Mexican" all my life.
It is a word ethnic, as what my friends in Boston use when they say 'Irish', or my friends in New York when they say "Italian."
Then I became "mexico-américain."
But, here, it was Mexico.
And, on the ground that has seen my grandfather, no need for special word or bridge.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in any language.
But I do not have the vocabulary of an indigenous, and I cannot lose my American accent.
Then I took my American passport and I headed towards the queue "foreigners."
I thought at that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique pena nieto came to President Obama, to the White House.
Usually, when the leaders of the two countries meet, their favourite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than to risk in the United States.
He wants to side with the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And pena nieto is committed to the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although it did not provide more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and embittered.
Most Americans have probably never reflected on the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced its leaders to surrender by writing half their territory at the forefront of the gun.
But for Mexicans, and in terms of centuries, not minutes, the memories are everywhere.
Therefore, when an official U.S. formula any criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear - in the Mexican press, and among the elite - complaints about the way the Americans violate the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children of montezuma seek the brawl.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that the country has with the more than 35 million mexico-américains who live in the United States.
You want that considering the case of bitterness?
There are many.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country and other opportunities for which the country does not offer.
The only reason for the large number of ancestors Mexicans in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that at some point in our tree généalogique, someone, perhaps a parent or a grand-parent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go in the north.
And often, they corresponded to a profile type - a skin foncée, few literate, from a poor village, etc.
We are their offspring, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we now live the American dream, we went to good schools and we have good situations, we must never forget that it is the American Dream that we live, and not that of Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We are in the United States.
We also know that some of the elite Mexican among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remember them a humiliating defeat and they toisent as if we were lower strain of individuals and not enough Mexican.
The Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, life is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never be parties.
And we will not stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife who was born in Guadalajara and who has emigrated legally in the United States when it was child, remember that there is friction between the Mexican and the mexico-américains because Mexicans more firmly declare their identity and the mexico-américains are upset.
Although American citizen, it has the feeling of being part of two countries.
Moreover, many mexico-américains that I know did not appear to be part of a country or another.
One is the worship of the Mexican music, Los del Norte tigers, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in any of the two.
In Mexico, we regard as the Americans.
And in the United States, we regard as Mexicans.
And now, for a little more complicated the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexicans and part of the intelligentsia leaders want to move closer to the diaspora.
They want the makeshift mexico-américains working as ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a beautiful country that must visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
This will not happen.
There is too much bitterness.
And if we look at the wage inequality, corruption and violence linked to drugs that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You will have to cope alone, amigos.
This is normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they have treated the Mexico a century and a half ago, so they have to accept that some mexico-américains them want always to how the family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
We may more Mexicans than I had thought."
Old grievances, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a setback for peace.
Could never be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
A further bloodshed seems to indicate that this is a vain hope.
While still the same arguments futile over who began, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed Near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel and the Holy City of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has done everything fall apart, and whether we like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their fight will be even more.
However, there is every reason to believe that this could help them to overcome the impasse deadly.
A war that is no loser and no winner
At first glance, it is hard to be optimistic.
Although the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, the fighting this week have strengthened the supporters of force, on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that runs the Gaza since 2007, targueront have forced the Israelis to abandon, while Gaza has suffered a kicking.
Having killed some of their leaders and removed the 1.7 million residents of Gaza to one of the most miserable and overcrowded corner of the world, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine at the hands of their rivals Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, the leaders of Hamas might say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas has been the rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a growing regional power, formerly Israel's closest Muslim ally, has made a strong case for Hamas, like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states of golf.
Hamas members jubilent and say that the growing Islamist curve around Israel, from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exerts its domination, via Syria, where the Islamist rebels to trend can overthrow Bashar Assad El, and up to Jordan, where the allies Hamas threaten the king.
And most importantly, on Israel's southern flank, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous central and most Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the dictator who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
However, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more accessible to the public.
In future, Hamas diplomacy can emerge as a strong player who will not be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of the hard line of Israel draw the opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas has been called into box.
The missile interception system called iron dome has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep soundly in their beds - for some time.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unswerving support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being behind the latest wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has flourished, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the premier-ministre, who has totally ignored the peace process.
Although the firing of rockets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by the suicide attacks, including through the separation barrier that is encroaching on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, which protects the Jewish settlements continue to expand despite their illegal in international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose party Likud has merged with a more hawkish leader Avigdor Lieberman's party ahead of the election on 22 January, has the good part.
Why dorloter these fichus Palestinians by giving them a state?
Had they been running the West Bank, not lanceraient-ils rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and hit them as soon as they leave the head.
Perhaps that supporters of the hard line will prevail; but it may be that the Arab Spring is changing the landscape.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere like little Israel, their priority is to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel's defense budget is more important than its four Arab neighbors together.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to put their economies.
Mr morsi has worked with Barack Obama for a ceasefire which bodes well - and could be the start of something.
The Israelis should also look to the future.
With the rest of the Arab world who becomes more democratic, deny the Palestinians their right to self determination could create a powder keg that is set to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The crackdown has already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics exacerbates the problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to stop Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic level.
Both sides need to be driven by those from outside.
The answer is as advocated by reasonable people found on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for safety.
One hope, small and in the short term, is that the ceasefire will have the opportunity to defend people outside this cause.
Egypt, who must now work to stop the flow of arms into Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in the 1967 borders with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.
Outside the Arab countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to coalesce.
This would do much more to the creation of a Palestinian state that the proposal next to a so-called state at the UN.
Mr Obama also has an interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term, he has not presented its own peace plan.
To return to the White House, it seems equally reluctant to set one up.
This is a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is vital for America.
These include a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for neutral packs of cigarettes came into force in Australia
Warnings and pictures of diseased organs cover the dark green packages that are all the same, regardless of the brand
The law came into force in Australia is a world first, the logos and the colours were replaced by a dark green olive and horrific pictures of diseased organs and pictures of children and their parents of babies whose illnesses were caused by smoking.
Apart from different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small print on all packages.
It is the most strict regime in the world in terms of tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government has said that the aim was to deter young people from smoking by removing any representation glamour.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26 years, there are 99% chance that they never started.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message of the tobacco companies through their brand image," said the Federal Minister of Health, tanya plibersek, citing studies that have shown by example that children team up the crown of a logo to a princess. "
Although Australia has the lowest rate of smoking in the world and if these changes have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has lobbied against the bill.
The tobacco companies have said that it would reopen the black market trade, which will provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
'Adverse consequences result of this legislation," said Scott mcintyre, of the British American Tobacco Australia.
The counterfeiters of China and Indonesia will sell many more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others have said that the law had boosted their activity.
Sandra ha of zico import pty Ltd, a small family business, said that demand for étuis to cigarettes, including silicone to conceal the horrific packaging, two months ago has increased significantly since britain''s Imperial Tobacco, British American Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have challenged the law and lost in the High Court of Australia.
Ha said that zico has sold 6,000 to distributors and is awaiting a renewal of stock.
For us, business is good.
The only problem, the experts say, is the popularity of social media and the edge of people targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertisements to the TV, sports sponsorship and the requirement for dealers to conceal the cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by companies and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign Web sites to do.
"If you work in the marketing of tobacco and you will no longer have a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the place key par excellence," said becky freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman has noticed an increase in contributions of some ordinary citizens for brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask whether this is a simple citizen who loves cigarettes marlboro and who has bothered to make a video, or if it is a marketing campaign waged by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry focuses on the new rules in force rather than on marketing.
The industry has gone up to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest these new court decisions - these countries have said the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of them has had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the year 2013.
Plibersek said that the government had held discussions with other countries about similar laws on the packaging.
Canada became the first country to make mandatory warning pictures on packaging in 2001.
Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are currently studying in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain indifferent to these photos.
The photos do not disturb me.
I ignored them.
"You take a cigarette and you ranges package," said Victor El hage when buying a package which includes a photo of tumors in the mouth.
To be honest, the only thing that will stop me is my little girl.
James Yu, a master of the "king of the pack tobacconist" in the centre of Sydney, said that the consistency of packaging made difficult the rangement packages on the shelves.
"Before, I needed an hour to unload a parcel, now I have to four hours," said Yu.
"The government had to ban them once and for all, and we would have said OK, this is good, you stop and you put the key in the door," he added, by lifting the hands in the air.
In a world constantly connected, it can be good to be boring.
I spent five hours at an airport during the period of thanksgiving, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.
Therefore, I had enough time to consider the issue of boredom.
I am not going to lie.
Spend half a day at an airport to take a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iphones to distract you - without forgetting the duty free shops.
But increasingly, some academics and experts in child development are the praise of boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to bore from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to borrow some interesting ways, or even to feed creativity.
And as we are, for the most part, constantly to several types of screens, we no longer have the benefits of boredom.
So we should welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I will return.
First of all, like many people, I thought the problem was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter toohey, professor of ancient history of Greece and Rome to Calgary University, Canada, and author of "boredom: has lively history - Yale University press, 2011."
"The problem goes back very far," he says.
On the walls of pompéi feature of graffiti that speak Latin boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood agrégé, professor of psychology at York University in the Ontario, Canada.
Having travelled many publications and presented the idea to a group of discussion about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have identified the problem as an experience which is "trying to do something, but without managing to engage in an activity satisfactory."
What differentiates the boredom of apathy, he says, is that the person is not carrying out a task it all.
With apathy, he says, it is not the desire to do something.
What is at the heart of the problem, he said, is "stopping the process of attention, combined with a low mood and feel that time passes slowly."
The boredom can significantly look like a depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if the two may be linked, the bother people tend to think that the problem is with the environment or the world, while the depressed people believe that the problem is one of them.
Sometimes, sometimes we think we ennuyons when it is actually a problem of concentration.
In their study," the unengaged mind: defining boredom in terms of attention," which was published in the journal "perspective we psychological science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have highlighted earlier experience in which the participants listened on tape, the voice of someone reading a magazine article.
Some groups have heard, from the room to hand the her too high of a TV programme that had no connection, others have just heard the emission of TV, and the third group has not heard the bande-son.
Those who have heard the TV at a low noise level have said that they were more annoyed than the other two groups - they vote must have had difficulty concentrating, but did not know why, and gave this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult task or skin, disrupting the attention can lead to boredom, said mark J. fenske agrégé, a professor of the University of guelph Ontario neuroscience and one of the authors of the study.
However, when you do a boring task, like watching of things on an assembly line, music can help you not to bore you."
In fact, he says, now, we know that when we are tortille or griffonne, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigoter learn more and get more information than those who are forced to remain without moving," said Professor fenske.
We all ennuyons one day - the delay of my flight of aircraft, a speaker with a voice lacking in sparkle, a film very boring.
But some people are more likely to be boring than others.
To measure this, researchers have developed a "level of willingness to boredom" in the 1980s.
The level includes statements such as," among the tasks that I carried out, many are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I do not have the time to do everything."
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to be boring more often than girls, said Stephen vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and need incentives including many and varied.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blasés.
In 1991, Reed larson, a professor in individual and community development at the University of Illinois, has conducted an experiment in which he has contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
It found that 32 percent of teenagers said is boring to school and during their duties in the home, while 23 percent said boring when they were not at school.
However, 3 per cent of parents have said is boring.
Professor larson said he did not know if the percentages of boredom of today, is 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said he knew that "adolescence is a time when boredom reached its highest level," particularly as children and teenagers have little control over what they want to do.
If I ask my question: the problem is it good for you?
In its extreme form, sometimes not, because it can cause people to take risks absurd to Paris or physical abuse of certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
However, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades.
"The problem is the way that the brain has reached to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the n.y.u.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you ennuyez and you use this energy to play the guitare and cooking, this will make you happy.
But if you look at the TV, that make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
If your child is weary and that you give it an iPad, it is not, but he has not learned to deal with ennuiera alone or to autorégler, says Professor fenske.
And "this autorèglement passes from one situation to another," he states.
Your child learns not just to entertain, it gets more control of himself in other areas.
I do not think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I do not believe that we should criticize him.
Feel at ease outside the constant seething reservoir that generate the activities and the technology is the goal to which we should strive.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to be fed more often, but boredom arouses acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what the people want, this is a way to disconnect and enjoy the day.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulés," he added, "it is difficult to find ways to engage in something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directive for the new law on marijuana
Anthony orozco, 19 years old, a student at a university and footballer in the Colorado is charged for something that will soon be legal in his state: boulettes possession of marijuana and a pipe used for smoking.
Mr orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were on a car to lamar, amid the fields, near the border with the Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr orozco received a citation to appear for possession of drugs and material used for consumption - minor offences, each with a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr orozco.
But is it a?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the vote of Colorado to legalise the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving a small drug use depends more on the location of the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana were classified without result.
The police have continued to charge more for adults 21 and minor possession of marijuana, because the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors who are more conservative in the constituencies of Colorado called to accelerate the existing business of marijuana and continue to charge people who have them.
At the same time, several towns in the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West vote now to prevent the opening of shops selling marijuana certified by the state in their neighborhoods.
"Things are changing so rapidly that I do not know what is to come," said Daniel J. oates, the police chief of aurora, East of Denver.
State regulators in Washington are also plenty of questions.
They are in search of guidelines on how to install a system of permits, allowing to produce, produce, distribute and sell - before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that the Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most of the States in terms of regulation on marijuana, first on the use for therapeutic purposes and now for personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, acknowledges Mr Smith, can do no more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we can build," he said.
Washington's law, which is called i-502, takes effect on 6 December, leaving a loophole for a year, during which the permit system does not always exist, while the possession of marijuana is legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain unresolved: how to balance the state's mandate that ensures adequate access to licensed marijuana and bans the installation of shops selling cannabis in a radius of 30 km around a school, a park, a playground or a nursery.
"There will be no more difficult places that urban areas to install a trade approved sale of cannabis, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben livingston, a spokesman for the legalisation of cannabis center, a research group recently formed.
On 21 November, the police chief, oates, aurora, sent an email to his officers, saying that the "city attorney representative of Public Prosecutor" no longer meets the people of 21 years and more with small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop to charge people for this type of crime "with immediate effect."
The chief oates said that the police would the new court rulings that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In weld county, in the north of Colorado, the "attorney district prosecutor of the Republic", Ken buck, embodies a vision more strict.
After the vote, he said that his office would continue to deal with cases of possession of marijuana, mainly to put pressure on users to be désintoxiquer.
Currently, 119 people are convicted of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to more charges.
"Our office has the obligation of prosecutions against those who have committed a crime that, at the time of the facts, was an offence," said Mr buck acknowledged.
The reactions were complicated even in rural areas as Mesa county, where voters have rejected the initiative for the limited use of marijuana.
Police in great junction, the largest city in the county, does not appear to adults for possession of small amounts.
The representative of the county prosecutor, pete hautzinger, supported the decision, but has also decided not to classify without following all the detentions of marijuana.
"I do not have the impression of wasting my time to continue to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of voters in Colorado have supported the measure, provide an appropriate legal framework and government to personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in various American cities reveal the deep ambivalence among local officials about the legalization of marijuana.
"It is a cultural barrier" with representatives of the Public Prosecutor, said Sean mcallister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of local consumption of marijuana, and expressed as spokesman of the National Organisation for the reform of marijuana laws' National Organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent much of their lives to prosecute people who consommaient marijuana, too, have difficulty in accepting that this is legal," he said.
As the first States to treat the limited use of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, the Colorado and the state of Washington are becoming a case law for the legalisation of drugs.
While advocates and representatives of the state provide a new frontier of legalised sales, they expect with concern the guidelines of the federal government, which still sees the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Supporters of the legalization of marijuana, hope that the Ministry of Justice cèdera.
Despite some arrests profile of patients under medical marijuana and sellers, the federal government has mostly allowed the shops selling marijuana for therapeutic purposes to exercise in the Colorado, in Washington and in 16 other states.
It is true that the police will probably not kicked in the door to take small sachets of drugs, it is likely that it opposes the shops approved sale of marijuana for personal use permitted under the new laws, said Kevin A. sabet, a former policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities of Colorado did not wait for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the vote, some local authorities have approved moratoriums on the creation of new shops selling marijuana, even if it is only a delay of a year.
Last week, the city of montrose got 6 months and should impose a moratorium that ban next week.
"We do not want to end up in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then we end up with a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a Member of the City Council.
Our Community has voted against it.
We are interested in the vote of the Community rather than the vote of the state.
Many questions remain.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied and excluded from Oxford, because I was a "Tory" - conservative.
It is not just the students of today who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I have always dreamed of going to the University of Oxford.
My father and my older brother studied in what was a prominent place for me to know, a kind of Greek amphithéâtre of modern times and the two pillars of civilisation, free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after having installed to worcester college in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to make my baggage, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father has collapsed and started to cry.
My friends were puzzled.
The newspaper the standard evening claimed that I had left the university student because I had objected to the fact that the first round had sexual relations in the House next to mine.
The author A. N. Wilson said with facétie that I was part after being forced to drink in the tasses ébréchées.
The truth was less funny.
I have fled.
Yes, I have fled, because I had been victim of intimidation and been the subject of constant bullying.
Not because of my name rather extreme, or due to the fact that I was coming to a private school.
I have been persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of supposedly know, I have been the victim of a racist behaviour and barbaric: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advised of Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why make it now, you might think.
Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of students of centre right suffers the same type of persecution.
The growing hatred and institutionalised Tory student in Oxford is such that last week, some of them have demanded a protection of their rights, as well as the gay, ethnic minorities and disabled people.
Conservative Members of the Chamber - jcr of corpus Christi college students said that they were "often isolated, attacked personally and felt unwanted" because of their political views.
They want there to be a representative in the Committee of the university for equal opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC two "Wonderland: young, bright and the right lie" - "the Wonderland: young, smart and right," dedicated to the policy among students, who painted a graphic picture of skinheads and the Tories as eccentric.
For example, they found the student Joe cooke, former President of the Oxford University conservative association 'ouca, who drives a Rolls-Royce, carries a comprehensive silver and moves with a cane to head chromée.
In other universities, students conservatives say be treated as scapegoats for the introduction of the increase in costs of schooling."
Luke black, 20 years, Vice President of the Nottingham university conservative association, told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing leftist bias in universities.
People think we are like the bullingdon club without even we have faced."
Samuel Roberts, 21, history student at corpus Christi, who has tabled a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is "uncomfortable," and stephanie cherill, 19 years old, President of the ouca, said that there had been a deterioration in the attitude of the jcr towards people who are of centre right.
"This is a barrier to freedom for intellectual debates, and the welfare of Members," she said.
I was the only one to think this way in my first weeks at Oxford.
I came in September 1986, I was 18 years old and a paralysing shyness.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very fierce.
Last year, the university had voted the denial of Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in funding of higher education.
The atmosphere was charged with Stalinist vibrations.
Host from the early days of the week, when the new students got to know each other and teachers, I had a foretaste of what will happen afterwards.
I discovered that the teachers were not only the sarcasm to students Tory, but what more, they were fun.
It was as if the policy on minors strikers, privatisation and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was etched in the wood in classrooms.
The first sarcasme which I was victim was an 18th century French translations into English texts, and I was not prepared.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt, now deceased, "please bring the first paragraph"
I have lost touch.
Pitt, a small man with the face pustuleux, is easily win.
"Will the thatchéristes refuse to learn French or are just stupid?" he asked.
Other students have patronised.
The tears me brûlaient us.
"I suggest you take courses in French during your free time - finally, if you are not too busy to make friends," he launched a hargneux tone.
I am back in my room, inconsolable.
At the dinner this evening, I am sitting alone and I felt a slight kicking on my shoulder.
It was a second year student of English studies, appointed James, who appeared as a member of the ouca.
"I know who you are," he said, gently.
I fear it.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory - Conservative - is targeting.
It is already hard enough to me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be even harder for you.
Most of the young Tory claim to be the labour - labour.
Later, at a local pub, I have a cowardly attempt to hide.
I spoke about the fact that I did not agree with everything that was said Mrs Thatcher.
This ploy failed.
A student in first year of philosophy, which, ironically, had studied Eton economic and political science, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pigs."
You are contaminated.
Other students have taken up the refrain.
I was being corrupted, dirty.
"How the Tories do they love?" asked one.
They hit each other, isn't it? "
I felt like the liberal gay before the legislation of the 1960s.
Would I have only been able to lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after the fall of the night?
Would I have had to become labour and deny my opinions?
The next three years would seem like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory was Professor Norman stone, professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
It was loathed not only because he was conservative, but also because it was Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speeches.
It was almost never there.
He hated this place marxiste-déterministe provincial and insignificant, and its adherence to the point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a teaching job at the University of bilkent, in Ankara, Turkey.
"You are not happy here," he told me.
I started to commuting between Oxford and the home of my parents in London, finding refuge with my family and my friends cities more open mind.
I said to my father that I hated Oxford and I have explained why.
It was incrédule.
During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But this is the best place in the world," he told me pathétiquement.
They are not enough, not in the city to clochers dreamers.
Even my friends Communists had impeccable ways.
He had tears in their eyes.
Laisse-leur a chance.
I am sure this is to goad you.
I would break my heart if you leave Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, has succumbed to the pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a session of work led the following week, when another professor of history suggested the world's more seriously, that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do so.
Rougissant internally in shame, I recognised fall victim to brainwashing of my parents and the "old traitai mad."
The respite was short lived.
It was my father who has descended the last nail in my coffin oxfordien.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week.
The door was locked.
I was Tapie in my room, and after five minutes, my poursuivants have abandoned.
When they are gone, I have made my suitcase and I took the first train to London.
I am never returned.
You may deal with chicken pleurnicharde.
But no child of 18 should not be subject to such intimidation in a school setting.
The tragedy is that it was from Oxford, who not only has produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys a solid reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefer the elegance of fame '
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a master at couture" opened this week in London, ABC asked naty abascal, Fiona thyssen-bornemisza and other clientes's famous "Italian.
Somerset house, the former residence of élisabeth anger of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino garavani.
The "recognized at the opening of" Valentino: a master at couture ', a prestigious event that brings together more than 130 models of high couture created for his house of couture over the past 50 years.
"I love this building," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only player has "It signore garavani, but that could not have been written without its famous clientes.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and part of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, open until 3 March, is an impressive number of private letters and photographs signed by the cream of the aristocracy, since the Princess salimah Aga Khan until Lord snowdon, via the Princess marie-chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino describes his personal recollections as trophies to his advancement: the "modest voghera of the city, in northern Italy, the idol of the jet-set international.
There is nothing wrong with love the royals.
"At least they do not crush their mégots cigarettes on your wonderful carpet as do some of the pop stars," says Baroness Fiona thyssen-bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino host is a spectacular and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all adorions be invited in his chalet gstaad," explains the ex-femme "heini" Thyssen, intimate friend of beauty from the past as marella Agnelli or eugénie niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance to fame.
Even so, it is a star.
Valeria mazza, wearing a model Valentino
The Argentine mannequin, valeria mazza, has not forgotten the charisma of".
Several years ago, after a parade on the place of Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
There were about 20 people, including Sharon stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and saw his spirit in every detail of her apartment, in the decoration, food, music.
"With him, every guest feel important and appreciated," recalls the "top model," which has started working with him during the week of the haute-couture in Paris in 1995.
"It will never be acceptable to fashion, because his creations are works of art," termine-t-elle.
Parade of lines of nobility
The life of garavani is not a story of obsessions but amours shared.
He likes the people of high and with the most headlines and they love it too.
One of the galleries of Somerset house has been turned into a podium glamour of 60 metres wide, proposing to swap the roles: the visitor takes the place of models and is marching on the podium to admire a "public" dream on the main Valentino creations, was chosen as the tailor Jackie Kennedy for her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the suit that was Monica vitti in "The notte ', or a wool coat and fur that belonged to Empress FARAH diba.
Among the public of models were names such as Luxembourg sybille, Gloria von thurn und taxis mette-marit Norway rosario Bulgaria or Sophie von Habsburg.
Naty abascal and the "in 2006
Many of its clientes say that the first clothes Valentino are like the first love," impossible to forget."
I remember it well.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a jacket gilet gillette and collecting automne-hiver 1971-1972.
"This is a gift that I did," said naty abascal, one of the "muses.
"I prefer to others for her femininity, his love of women, and because it sublime our beauty," adds ex-duchesse feria.
I love the he uses, they are bright colours and throw the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The Princess and modeuse Patricia Della giovampaola arenberg cannot forget, either, the first time it has been a model Valentino.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreams of having the age and the chance to wear one of his dresses for the evening...
Finally, it was possible at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a festival in the castle's cousin, Prince Eduard line.
It was a penitent's evening red, with a jupe to flying, a bustier draped and a décolleté fall.
"It was a dream come true," said the widow of rodrigue arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless," explains the aristocrate Italian who share his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess arenberg retains the skirts of evening of "with" the utmost care, because a penitent night is not only a penitent, it is also all the memories it vehicle. "
The "king" of fashion
The grand final of the exposure of Somerset house is the penitent marie-chantal Miller married during his marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" - the "call for its couturières - to achieve the penitent in silk ivory with beads, 12 different kinds of dentelles incrustations and a four and a half metres behind.
According to the journalist Suzy menkes, supreme authority of the specialist press, this penitent represents a historical fact of the high couture at the end of the 20th century," the return of the high clientes society."
Obnubilé for years by the "savoir-être" dignity, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce, the greatest prize in Italy, cavaliere del lavoro commandeur of the order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honour, garavani performs as much credit as any husband of its clientes.
"Its refinement, calm, I have always jumped for his part treated and perfect," acknowledges arenberg.
The last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a dinner of exhibition at the Museum of orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the comtesse Jacqueline ribes, one of my great friends.
"It was pristine, the years have no effect on him."
If it is a princess who says...
The hardest job in the world: the human mules kawah ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health, with 70 kilos of sulphur in the stone pathways slopes.
There are people for whom work is an inferno and others who work literally in hell.
In the case of anto wijaya, one of 400 minors who earn their living in carrying the sulphur volcano kawah ijen, East of the Indonesian island such as Java.
It must work every day until the bottom of cratère, where gas sulfurique from the Earth is entrailles solidifie on contact with air.
Having received large rocks of sulphur, hanging around EUR 70 kilograms, it brings them into two baskets in bambou he burden on his shoulders through the trails slopes.
There are just 250 metres until the cime volcano which exhausted running at 2,386 meters, but those are more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a rate of tortoise, with the balance and measuring their not not to trip and fall into the abyss.
They know that a false move could cost them life, as has happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the volcano kawah ijen several years ago.
The miners of kawah ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur extracted.
Once on top, they find their way between the tourists who these as if they were circus animals, and with painfully heavy baskets, they walk the three miles to the balance that a mining company has installed a little contrebas 1,850 meters.
It is about PT candi ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960, and we can tell its employees, to whom it pays 662 roupies Indonesian - 5 cents per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it to 10,000 roupies - 83 cents to the oil industry as the ore is very present in everyday life and is used in the production of candles, fireworks, cosmetics, of dynamite and being used to launder the sugar.
"As we move about 70 kilograms, we earn around 46,000 roupies - 3.8 euros for each trip," explained anto, which usually makes three trips a day.
All it takes 3 hours and it ends up, but it allows him to win 138,000 roupies - 11,50 euros at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, is triple what it would gain in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 roupies - 1,20 euros per day and where the average monthly salary is two million roupies '167 euros, says the carrier who once worked as a builder on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 roupies - 6,20 euros per day and the job was not as difficult but anto banyuwangi came close to his family, a village near the volcano in Indonesia, for a reason that is also indisputable that sulphur: 'I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have just Java into converting to Islam itself."
Anto suffers from asthma, is breathing with difficulty, tousse constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.
In 27 years, he spent three of his life to defy the danger on the kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already begun to make him pay the bill although it covers his face with a special wearing gloves and masks.
Anto suffers from asthma, is breathing with difficulty, tousse constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano.
This is the price he must pay to pursue his dream.
"I will work even two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French" promet-t-il English in a more than acceptable.
Bullied by life, this young attractive and intelligent could be tourist guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, it is the work of a donkey.
He shares the unhealthy with other carriers, wood masure rose every day at 2 in the morning because the sulphur is not discover the night, when its distinctive yellow colour is blue and shine through the darkness.
Defying the gloom, anto descend upon the cratère shining with a small lamp set to his helmet, he has bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers do the baskets of sulphur from the bottom of cratère on their shoulders.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mécanisé extraction of sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment for carriers who work on their own and are paid by weight.
In addition, they do not affect a under 30,000 roupies - 2,50 euros - to increase by camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 roupies - 1,20 euros - that the guards of the tourists who come to not charge the volcano national park and its human mules.
"This work is done for the animals, not for humans," protest madrusin, a bearer corpulent of 42 years who is kawah ijen for 30 years, since he has left the College.
That will hold up to 110 kilograms, he insists that he will not halt to work "as long as he can," because it needs money to bring up their three sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I will not take my retirement, I will die a here because the volcano is my life.
Although the sulphur harms the throat and irritates the eyes when the tide is turning and trap the miners in the épaisses columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that nobody complains to suffer severe diseases... which are obviously their usual respiratory problems, arthroses, pain in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, unainik, aged 53, can only take 50 kilos.
Each day, he and his companions gain 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano, that three trucks carrying the tamansari warehouse, to 18 kilometres away by a path of goats invaded by weeds.
"I would not take my retirement, I will die a here because the volcano is my life," says unainik by opening of the mouth, dévoilant several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30 years, also works as the bearer of sulphur.
As time passes, but the misery continues from generation to generation, one of the most difficult jobs in the world: what do the human mules volcano kawah ljen.
Singapore searches for babies to save the economy
The singapouriens lay the blame for this lack of children on the career, the stress and the cost of access to the property.
"The population of Singapore must be developed."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, hold our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come from an advertisement for the capsules to the menthe, but despite this, or perhaps because of it, the video has spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references like "will put an open in the box" to mock the birth rate in Singapore.
Bbh, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a funny with this advertising.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to get people fulfil their national duty."
It is intended solely to the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and funny.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, and we felt that this was an issue that we must address.
We knew that the government had tried several things as launch perfume to speed-dating phéromones or organise parties.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they may not have worked.
We therefore said the following: what could be more creative to solve this problem to a rap song?
1.2 children
The government of Singapore does not take more seriously.
He spends 1,300 US dollars per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A measure of the government in favour of marriages and fathers pays up to $15,000 per child, longer maternity leave and distributes profits tax.
But it had little effect.
Singapore is a rich cité-état and high technology of Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national distribution of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, regarded as the replacement rate, was in 1976.
So why did not the singapouriens more children?
Tan Wei Ming, the political director of marriage and the family of the division of the national population, says that this is due to a "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities."
"This allowed people to have a broader range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond the marriage and the establishment of a family," explique-t-elle.
These changes have contributed to the increase in the number of social standards and single to delay marriage and the birth, which results in a falling birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy to sharply increase immigration to counter the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that moves a thinly disguised xenophobia against the new immigrants, in particular by the Chinese who are accused of drawing the wages down and not to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as a reason why the party up in Singapore last year suffered its worst election result since independence.
Since the election, they tried to correct the problem with the introduction of quotas and high taxes for foreign workers.
Consequences inespérées
While the falling birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, the health costs and immigration policies, Singapore is an example of unintended consequences.
The government is trying to prevent the construction of many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The government's urban development began to control the number of small flats, known as "shoe box, that could be built in certain areas of the city.
These flats have an area of 46 square metres and their sale wins every success.
However, the authorities are concerned about the fact that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage the developers wanting to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew soon, Director General of the society immovables El developers, says that his "boxes of shoes" sell much faster than larger ones.
They are more popular, in the sense that these houses are built far more quickly than larger.
For this reason, it is more profitable for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer guidelines to developers, who were previously put up obstacles if they wanted to offer too small in a housing project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a cité-état.
If the new regulations could be a step towards increasing the birth rate, in discussions with the national singapouriens who work in the financial district of central, it seems that they are not going to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive, like education, that is why people back to later," says a young framework.
The other people can have children.
"But for me, it is important to have my money and my time," we declare another young for 20 years.
Men and women mention their careers, the stress and the cost of access to the property and education as the reasons they should not have children.
And, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, it is the singapouriens themselves who have the last word.
What is offline private is private online
Confidentiality
According to the dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, it is the quality of the private sphere or "the intrusion of privacy that we can protect."
That est-ce-qui is a private matter for those under 16 years?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on the social networks?
Understands the dangers it is exposed to distribute events on the web that it would share certainly not offline?
The newspaper elperiódico asked five boys, aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the web.
In four cases, they associate the word "something very personal" on a personal level and "the password and user name" when they have applied to social networks.
"I do not dévoilerai my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years ago, when he tries to explain the meaning of the word private on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and windows live messenger, where it has an account for two years.
"These are secret very secret, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
I post images on fb sympas or games.
I talk with my friends.
"I do not share one of my photos or someone who would be stupid," he says.
The boy concedes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked people must, humiliating or violent crimes or write comments.
Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 friends on fb and its new subscribers on Twitter.
The majority are from the family.
His mother is a part, it is the watchword of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to speak and write tweets interesting posts.
"I do not know if they say, I just the post," it added.
"Social networks are fun, I can speak with distant relatives or friends, so fast," he says.
He says that he would never accept the request for an unknown person.
He does not trust anyone who would recommend a foreigner.
The case of Jose, 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, my space and ask about it, he admits not know 20 people included on its list of friends.
"I don't worry because we have something in common, music, for example," he states.
According to the boy, none of them has made advances nor asked him his address or phone number.
"If they were to pressure me or demanded, I supprimerais just in my mind," would he agree.
José has subscriber to ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences that we know today under the name cyberharcèlement are related to the boy.
A close friend of mine has been extorted money from on a social network.
They have threatened and demanded money.
"He has never known that it was" assure-t-il.
The victim, according to José, has not closed its account.
"It has only happened in private profile."
Then he explains a series of manipulation by configured board safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young posterait photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do it if I was angry or excited.
"Even though I know it's cyberharcèlement," he says.
Key Issues
Marielos porras, professor of English and dismissed in education and training, believes that, in guiding children and teenagers, we must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has created as a way to seek information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rules of the game has changed," mention.
Porras indicates that the academic Marc prensky, who has a master's degree in teaching at Yale University and author of the book "digital immigrants and native," uses the words to explain the phenomenon.
The digital native, they, children and young people who are born with the technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who need to teach them ourselves, as we are in the process of learning," she argues.
He added that the issue is complex," because we ask them to have a defined criteria on what to publish or to say whether to disclose at an age where they do not have the maturity to make it."
"We are also asking them to be selective when what matters most is to be popular, of having thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences" ajoute-t-elle.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach the confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use the issues that they are sobering.
"Tell them not to do so is useless," she says.
Then, porras lists some examples: there are things that you don't raconterais to a foreigner, why the fais-tu on the Internet?
Or, that te plairait-il they publish a picture of you as a friend that you published?
Do you know what others publish on you?
When you identifies photos of holidays, demandes-tu others permission to identify them?
And so does everybody need to know what you make every moment?
Another is to make them understand that they must act in line as they do offline.
It is the same rules.
"Outside of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, this must be the same on the social networks," she says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and education adviser, says that it is imperative for parents to read carefully the conditions of use of social networks.
By understanding each of the words they have solid foundations to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or to publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that we should not talk to foreigners.
The Unasur Summit ended without the Lima Declaration to be made public
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of Nations sud-américaines - Unasur ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration has been made public, although it has been previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 proxies here.
Efe has tried repeatedly to access the document signed in life ordinary meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the foreign ministry and the Presidency said initially that it would be released after the conclusion of the summit, then said that it would be published at any moment on the website of the Peruvian Government.
When they were asked about the text, they have indicated that its content was exposed by the President of Peru, ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit has constantly been limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential House with the message 'private session, audio limited was portrayed in the press room.
The little information circulating among the journalists were those given by the press officers of some of the governments of Unasur assistaient here, with the exception of Peruvian spokesman.
The only document leaked during the day was the list of Presidents here, which has caused unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media demanding more important news.
Later, the President of Peru has sent an email to the media with the final declaration of the summit, but this was the speech of President Humala and not the official document which has reached the summit.
Last October, Peru has been a guest of the third summit of American sud-pays Arab - ASPA - and, on this occasion, although it has been asked with body by the press, it did not broadcast the statement called Lima Declaration, as had been previously announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, we can establish that the document was published in March.
In the two international events, the Peruvian authorities have tried to establish secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited the maximum obtaining information.
The summit also agreed with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a different judgment by the Court in The Hague, which settles a border between the two countries.
Ollanta Humala, the Presidents of Peru and Chile, Sebastián he met at the regional meeting and said that they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear the pleas of both sides in the trial that Lima has brought against Santiago, which begins Monday in The Hague.
"We respect and exécuterons the verdict for solving the disputes that we have today in this court," said President Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country compliance with international law, to the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts," added the President he with a handshake to President Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of two Presidents that they submit to the ICJ this week took place after that Colombia has denounced the Pact to Bogota in which she had agreed to abide by the decision of the International Court, after a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua she considered seriously wrong.
The Summit was held without the presence of presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Evo Morales, Bolivia and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay Unasur, suspended for 2011 after the dismissal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not take part in the meeting.
Host President, Ollanta Humala, has been instructed to open the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The trustee has read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of 31 projects were set between the South American countries for a total of $17 million investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of the Unasur would place "important steps to achieve the aim of South American citizenship by the development of agreements on the residence permit."
He informed that action will be taken to improve the international cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised crime, action for better access to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices in the whole of South America, and joint and effectively to assess the risks of natural disasters."
With Europe in crisis," the economic consolidation of Latin America - must not have a matrix triumphalist but should help to increase our matrix productive and to see a better future for our people," President Humala has concluded.
"We have decided to concentrate on a group of 31 flagship projects that improve the connection of areas of South America, especially in rural areas and border... between our countries and in generating new economic cycles," said Peruvian President during a speech.
Such projects, he mentioned that five were Peru and were on the horizontal lines of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two were a greater connection with Ecuador, though he did not give further details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation of Paraguay.
"We hope that the country's electoral process will allow its reintegration sud-américaines nations within the Union," which he is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America is a region of peace and prosperity, integrated and having good relations with its neighbors, is another issue at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before beginning the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the next Saturday in Mexico to talk quietly of maritime dispute in a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow, Saturday, I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We will review all these channels, they are not comprehensive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua who will ask to have a discussion with the country," he said.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will resolve it the most civilized and respectful way," added President Santos.
The Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico where they planned to attend the takeover of the country's new president, Enrique peña nieto.
Similarly, in the context of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers will meet prior to approve the plan of action for the year 2013, which aims to strengthen dialogue and agreement in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter is suspended.
Peru pro acting holds the presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America Europe must learn how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, should take a leaf out of Europe."
President Correa, who attended the summit of the Union of life nations sud-américaines, Unasur, located in Lima, said on state television, TV péru, that Europeans had killed each other during the Second World War "and in other conflicts," but that they were now almost a homeland. "
In this sense, he has defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of the Unasur.
"We must come to the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American countries, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community reactionary, but there are still some areas that we want to belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, Ecuadorean President was in favour of the recovery of the Organization of American States - OAS - with the aim of reducing the influence of Ireland and states to take into account the San Jose signed the Pact on human rights.
Those who are constantly banging on about is never jeopardise anything, on the contrary, we, the South Americans, have all signed.
"It is incomprehensible that the Interamerican Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," he said, alluding to the political asylum granted by Ecuador on Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa insists that he does not regret his decision, as he himself has not betrayed his principles, but instead it has met its "deep democratic values and human rights."
He concluded that, at the time," there was the suspicion that Assange would be extradited to another country and that his trial would not be respected."
Moreover, he criticises the Swedish Justice who has demanded that it meets on its own territory to questioning about an alleged sex crime while the Swedish law permits to do so by videoconference, what could be done for the Ecuador embassy in London."
Correa said that there was a risk that the mental and physical health of Assange is deteriorating.
"I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, but the Ambassador has informed me that he had a small Ecuadorean lung problem, but nothing serious," the President said.
It is possible that his physical and mental health is deteriorating by being locked in a small area without power do exercises to open air.
"It affects the health of anyone," it concludes.
Correa says that the solution asylum granted to Assange since June in the embassy équatorienne in London, which would be the award of a free ticket that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and he points out that there have been discussions in London to find a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange baltazar Garzón's lawyer, has launched a series of procedures to various European institutions," he said.
And he believes that "if Britain gave the free ticket tomorrow, it would finish."
And if Sweden, as the only allows its legislation, and as it has done in other cases, asked Mr Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or the asked via Skype tomorrow, the problem would be solved.
Correa has benefited to reassert itself as a defender of freedom of the press and made it clear that it was not tolerated "mediocrity, bad faith and the lies that damage to the freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not politicians malicious or perverse but bad journalists in the pay of the greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
From this perspective, it is very pleased that this is not the kind of journalists "or bankers or the hegemonic country and bourgeois who dominate in Ecuador" and, instead of putting forward his reelection, "he approfondirait the revolution to continue the path and chart the right course."
Correa has also supported the decision to maintain the ban on Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, saying that the body should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and hidden coup attempts," in fact," it destroyed the legitimacy of democracy paraguayenne."
What is more, the Ecuadorean President sees as "perfectly appropriate" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the Court in The Hague, which will strengthen maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
For the moment, this judgment is not respected.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American countries.
The conflicts are unavoidable, but they must be overtaken by the desire to move forward together.
We must solve them together to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he said that he was confident in the right solution to the dispute over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same Court and he said that he is "good for Latin America understands the international institutions if the two countries agree to accept a judgment so strong that it is."
In reference to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, to seek a third consecutive term, he reported that he saw this opportunity "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult."
Correa said that if he lost the primary in February 2013, he is withdrawing from public life.
On a personal level, the power has never interested me, but in situations as unfair as the equator, this poverty socioeconomic cannot be solved through the political power.
"My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed the eventual victory but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I gagnais, this would be my last term and then I am to withdraw from politics.
If ever we lose, I will too.
"It is my decision," he said.
Correa has also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuela's president, Hugo Chávez, to Cuba.
I have to discuss with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he expected the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This is not a sequel to the health of President Chavez," he commented.
The Ecuadorean leader took part today in Lima on life summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of Nations sud-américaines - Unasur - which ended with a call for greater regional integration to support the progress, equality, and security.
The deaths related to AIDS are now due to a late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when it was confirmed the results of the test: séropositif.
"It is as if the sky had fallen on me in the head," he says referring at the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to "less painful," in vain.
The young man was hidden from her family.
He decided to take one of his illness and has begun to inform on it and her effort was as recently celebrated her 43e anniversary.
It is, without doubt, one of the oldest HIV patients in the unit of the civil hospital in Guadalajara - hcg - in which he was in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus - HIV - for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubts, little choice of treatment and stigma.
Even the director of a clinic in the imss avoided to say hello to him because he was "speechless."
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their illness, many people are still when the virus has already caused damage," exhausted "their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, at least after the first cases reported," the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who started treatment in time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the unit's HIV hcg, Jaime andrade Villanueva and it takes for reference that this information has been validated in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The infectiologue and expert on HIV/AIDS, andrade Villanueva, said that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of allocation of the immune system that showed patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those not using drugs: up to 30 years for a rate of 200 cd4 and up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 cd4.
Put simply, this means that for someone who get diagnosed HIV positive in 25 years," as long as he is under control, can live without problems up to 75 years," said the scientist asked.
To put this into context, we must realize that the life expectancy of Mexicans progress today is 76 years on average.
It is true that the mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of deaths from AIDS is past 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011, according to the annual report from UNAIDS, but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients registered on the national database died.
Nothing to Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May this year; however, we are assured that universal access to antiretroviral medicines is since 2005.
So why is there still some deaths?
I believe that the problem is not with access to treatment.
That is how I see it, this is what happened in our hospital.
For at least the last 12 years, we never failed to medicines, the problem is that patients are very advanced stages of because they do not know they are infected, and then they learn in advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they are already an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is making earlier diagnosis, and for that, we need testing on a massive scale, to all those who require it."
Experts and members of the Council of State to prevent AIDS Jalisco - coesida agree on its proposal, as patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who has had to test it in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done and that, despite his young age, he was already carrying the AIDS and sarcome kaposi, had a cancerous tumour which is one of the current complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some believe that they will die and do not know.
"If I will die, it is better that I hit three times per week," they say, I do not.
The change was beneficial, I eat well, I am of the exercise, I take my medicines.
To this day, his parents know only that he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I am involved attention to me and to the other person," says Fabrizio, who has agreed to share his intimacy with milenio Jalisco, thanks to his testimony, to help those who are afraid today in the running of the World AIDS Day.
They make the test, if they have taken risks, so they will know soon if they are positive and the better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that you can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message is the slogan of the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.
The condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between the health programmes and the ordinary citizen, supports Ricardo Salazar, Guadalajara reporter who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest lies in prevention.
In all the places for that," We have certainly increased the distribution of condoms, before we gave one or two, now we have 100 packages, is very good, but that means that, even today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections were teenagers.
The question: 'What you're going to do? "asked with sarcasme and value judgments by social workers, the advisers guidance, pharmacists and healthcare professionals, is the issue that young people do not want to hear, ensures the journalist.
It proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only sold to shops, but that we find them in the distributors of public toilets and in places that frequent the young.
This is not to encourage promiscuity.
It is not about their pay girls and the motel responded, as the governor Emilio Gonzalez when asked whether there would be a distribution of condoms in his administration.
"This is not how it works sexuality, it is better to provide condoms people already sexually active," he said.
The figures to Jalisco
13,435 being reported cumulative - 12,158 1,317 of HIV and AIDS.
The State is the fourth state in the country in cumulative number of new cases and cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of those with HIV.
92% of contamination are through sex, 6% through blood and 2% through perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, as recorded in each case, there are four or five people that ignore.
A judgment call ratified by a United States court ignores debt restructuring of the vitro provided via a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, the scenario is a bad precedent for all national societies with contacts in the neighbouring countries and with solvency problems.
So it seems that the procedures for the survival of companies allowed by Mexican laws are not available in the country to the star-spangled banner, contrepied international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the ruling by judge on 15 June harlin hale of the bankruptcy court for the northern district of Texas, leaves the Mexican companies without defence against the possibility of blockade of their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the largest glass manufacturer from Mexico to the United States Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case indicates that creditors should register in the US bankruptcy law, the Court of Appeals for the fifth circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings is bankruptcy formalized trade with Mexico.
The first point would denounce the cooperation of international procedure in the event of insolvency of transnational companies with a profile.
In fact, the law Model United Nations for uniformity of international trade law was created for this purpose by the American law Institute as referee.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the vote intersociétés, recognised in the critical mass of bankruptcy, commercial debts incurred by subsidiaries in vitro against the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not be obtained.
But the Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There is a half a dozen examples, including agremex and comercial mexicana, which the Federal Institute of bankruptcy had guaranteed the debts.
Furthermore, what is certain is that, since it was the votes of subsidiaries, in every way the creditors of vitro who fought against it in the courts of the United States, namely the funds' vautour "as aurelios capital, aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool limited, did not get a majority.
The vote was of 45 votes to 37.
A fact omitted by the court of appeal.
On the other hand, vitro was blamed for the difficult situation that he encountered since 2008 without stop at the grave economic crisis that confronted the United States, reflecting the cost to the country.
For now, the family society González sada interjettera appeal before the court of appeal that the vote takes place in its entirety, that is to say with the five judges, since only three had voted.
The use of insurance calling the non-prospérité and requires a review of the case by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The most serious is that the courts have ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae "friend of the Court" in which was detailed the procedure followed in vitro as part of the bankruptcy law, by signalling that it freed up trade agreements signed by the two countries to the same level that paragraph 15 of us bankruptcy law.
In addition, it says that the country has pulled the principles of the United Nations Commission on international trade, namely the international rules for cases of insolvency, which ensure fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they overwhelm vitro and overwhelm the country.

Héctor "hetin Reyes" baseball is my life '
The baseball "globe-trotteur hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the ground and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico had knowledge of the history of local baseball as large as that of Héctor "hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that until a brain haemorrhage does condemn the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, be it as a player of lower leagues, the national team basketball player, manager and leader of the national team, with the bsn vaqueros bayamón or as president of the Federation of baseball.
"I have brought several hats in the baseball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was President of bsn, Director General of the national team and president of the Federation during the 1990s," remembers bayamón Reyes during a visit will hora prevail at home, where it lies with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years.
"Baseball is my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when he made that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all décorés of photographs and memories that recall his route out standards, this.
Bayamón in the heart
For all his memories, those that he treasures most are those who recall its passage as player in the team of vaqueros amid the 1950s until 1982, after 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
"This has been my best years, that I have benefited the most because I had the opportunity to participate in eight championships vaqueros from 1967, either as manager, co-manager or leader.
For many years in satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I later withdrawn during the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome mincy entered bsn's team.
From then on," cuco ortiz, who was a great administrator, has been leading the team," says Reyes.
I remember that gene bartow, who had been leader here and who was at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, said: "I have a player costaud for you, it measures two metres.
You want it? "
It is like this to begin mincy, one of the best players that had Puerto Rico.
Bartow was then recommended Raymond gausse level, which was naturalised and who was a better marksmen.
I remember he said that if mincy had enabled bayamon to win a championship, gausse would help us to try to win another.
He has won the championship of vaqueros with gausse, but only at a distance as in 1988 it was the great manitou of the Federation.
At that time, he wanted to take advantage of its burdens mincy and those in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time in the United States during the tournament pré-olympique of Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the world of 1990, when we came fourth and where we should have won the Bronze medal if the Canadian judge we had not been taking the last match, Reyes said.
1990 World's team is the best national team that you view?
It is one of the best, like that which has beaten the dream team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favourite is the Cuba panaméricains games in 1991, when we won the gold and we have put a kicking to the team of the United States, which was quite similar to that which won the Bronze in the world.
This team was not only comprising mincy gausse, Ramos Rivas, Fico almost piculín ortiz"," and there was also the young 'Javier toñito "colón and James Carter, the brothers, Francisco and Edgar, León and Mario" quijote 90 world "Morales, who had not been able to attend because of a problem of knees.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy at the tournament pré-olympique neuquén in Argentina.
With players like "canito nieves, Pablo alicea and the young rolando hourruitiner in replacement players suspended by the mess of Mar del Plata panaméricains games, we won gold against all predictions.
What has been the best player of Puerto Rico?
Undoubtedly, it is about piculín ortiz.
Its statistics in the international tournaments are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as did piculín.
And this without taking into account its trajectory in different leagues for which he has played.
That was the best leader portoricain?
It is very difficult to say.
We had a good team of Julio toro, flor meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, armandito Torres.
In young people, I love the work that is Leo arill.
To you, what is your greatest achievement in the Federation?
That time is one of the most glorious of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the bsn had up to 17 teams in a season.
What can you do?
There are things that I wanted to put in place, as the regionalisation of minor categories.
For example, the boys of ponce play only in their area and face only teams from other parts of the island in the national play-offs.
Today, young people travelling and playing too when not needed.
I have at least given the advantage of compulsory qualifications and courses for the leaders, the ground staff and referees.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, listening to music, I watch the clips of my time on YouTube, I take my grandchildren and, from time to time I attend basketball matches.
And of course, I take the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always with me.

But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of Larry délicieusement hated j.r. hagman enjoyed his greatest success.
The dramatic series of the channel CBS Ewing clan and their families has been broadcast in April 1978 in May 1991.
The slogan "who killed j.r.?," invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which the character of hagman is almost murdered, has generated speculation across the world and millions of dollars played in Paris.
Thanks to that, among other things, the series has reached a record audience for at this time.

A course on the "end of the world" has just begun
Every week, the students seeking apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the zombis, viruses and germs and global warming.
This semester, when religion Professor Stuart charmé decided to give a lecture on the end of the world, he knew that it launched a bait irresistible: the end of the "great count" of the Mayan calendar, on 21 December, which refer to many people as evidence of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor charmé had no idea of what the expected during the month: catastrophic hurricane sandy, a fiscal abyss that some have dubbed "The own Armageddon of debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the end of time theorists Christians believed that triggered the Apocalypse.
"I had not realised that it would be the most apocalyptic half that I have never experienced this week," said Professor charmé her students to the university rutgers-camden - New Jersey.
If you look what has happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we the racontions, this has been a very good period.
And we must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the Apocalypse.
And it is not the only teacher to give courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, the last of the story.
At temple, Assistant Professor Barry vacker uncovers the course "Media, Culture and end of the world."
Every week, the students seeking apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the zombis, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyse this because these ideas proliferate in time," he said, and the way they offer of hypothetical scenarios guide some human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyse films with apocalyptic themes and look at how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"I tried to tell my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible," said vacker.
On the main campus of the Pennsylvania State University, professor of Latin American history and his colleague Matthew restall Amara solari, an art history and anthropologie professeure deputy, have made team to give way, simply entitled "the end of the world."
"We add" 2012 "to have the opportunity to give the course again, if the world does not," said Professor restall disparaitrait.
Despite the looming disaster, students should study, building projects and spend their final exams.
In the State of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be spent the eve of the Apocalypse, the student leaves no other choice than to work "until the night of the supposed end of the world," said restall.
Prices were quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," said restall about its course for top students, consisting of 35 students.
We have received by email messages several weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
The students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to take comfort," says bridgid Robinson, a student in religion and sociology of 23 years, from haddonfield, New Jersey, of the University of rutgers-camden.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, both secular and religious, is just a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will wekesa really, a graduate student in psychology and sick bay for 25 years, said he viewed all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a place that taught here," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students, and even less of a teacher, do we believe in the world's end date of December 21 said.
"Our first project was the prophecy Mayan, and in some ways we have discredited," says Julie zegle, student last year to temple, aged 21 and from west Chester.
The Maya have never predicted the end of the world, it is just a key date on the calendar, said restall.
But I accept that there is an anxiety linked to the Apocalypse in Western culture, going back several centuries, which makes people respond to changes in their environment in predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has created a boom in such speculation.
"In other parts of the world, people do not believe in this," assure-t-il.
This is the majority of English world.
Joseph dougherty, a professor of religion at the university the room that offers courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded when asked if he knew that this was the way on "the end of the world."
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world," nous-a-t-il replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a thanks Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years, there was talk of many dates supposedly the last judgement, and it says that if nothing happens on 21 December," people will immediately start thinking about the next date "or to philosophise about the fact that the 21 December marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.
The students and the teachers are the date lightly.
Several have told us that they thought go away "from the end of the world."
"Sometimes I call friends and we rigolons together," said Samira Ford, student in communications for 20 years.
