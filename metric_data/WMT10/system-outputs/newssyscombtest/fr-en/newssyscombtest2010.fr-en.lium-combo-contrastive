The of Špindler for the moment that stays of a week for the New Year....
I think they will try one more time to the place, but they also and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of rooms will rapidly diminish, "said Jandura.
The tourism agency Ingtours of also proposes of free for all periods of winter..
The week of Christmas us most at the moment, it is not completely sold.

That is why we have already prepared a few last Christmas less expensive, "said the director of Ingtours Schiefert.

The first days of February go well, the remaining winter are moderately..
This year, the interest for stays of winter has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow to Krkonoše.
People expect that it to fall.

If the during the week, also will be complete, "think Schiefert.

United States: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It becomes even, the effort with which Barack Obama, president to the reputation of wise, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, that he considered himself as simple..
When he eventually leave its doctrine so, it turned out that he had in carbon paper since the Iraqi scenario of Bush three years ago.
Not content to use in the text itself several times "as in Iraq,", he has not hesitated, more importantly, to use the title of the Bush's speech in January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new way forward"
At the same time, he has personally criticized the idea of Bush to send reinforcements in an Iraq consumed by the civil war as "irresponsible and a decision in its consequences." "
The following month, however, have shown that the strategy of Bush, who came from the recommendations of the commanders of campaigns, was the only possible and likely to point that the newspapers currently do not speak at all of Iraq.
This has not enhanced the reputation of Bush, however, objectively speaking, it was left to his successor a final situation much more favourable than we could have hoped.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen
are the commanders of campaigns that have requested an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation in Afghanistan, General Stanley McCristal, which has severely criticized the reluctance of the White House in the habits of subordination.
men in order to make the situation more favourable.
The President has hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, at least he had defrauded the General of 10,000 soldiers.
He has managed to root out the promise of additional on the part of Europe, even if it were on 10 000.
the most problems throughout the strategy of Obama appears to be his intention to withdraw the forces from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this whole process within the next three years. The doctrine of Obama raises more questions than it provides answers..
Many doubt the fact that an increase of half will bring the same that progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders to honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation is by the exact opposite - we cannot rely on and no treaty is respected. respected.
In these conditions, difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, accustomed to change from day to day depending on what suits them.
The political institutions, although based, will remain as behind which will proliferate ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity about the reports, which are further complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "state quick to act,", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of the strategy of Obama makes perplexed by his.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has worsened and she is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and outside of the reality can be confident that the soldiers sent in the tumult of the war for their "return home to the" will bring a miracle. miracle
From a political point of view, set a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will see this as the indirect admission of defeat.
The last NATO summit has shown that the of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European politicians do not know or do not want to explain to their constituents security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and that the sanctions have no effect on the, the will face with the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
It will respond by example at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Each solution of this type will, however, a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only for Obama is the fact that there are still three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for that it is working on a new strategy, it would to be a flop..

It was not until at the end of the flight that there was damage on the equipment.
This is clearly the engine of the third stage of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from a moving boat in and
is the reason why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was likely by a "" defective "..
, the did not doubt for a moment that it is a Russian rocket..
The generals argue that this time, we cannot talk of failure..
The first two floors of the rocket have resisted and the damage was confined to the third.
In the previous cases, the have experienced failures on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches smoothly, the leadership of the Ministry of Defence considers that only six out of thirteen have been failures..
This success rate of almost 50 percent fills the general optimism and they therefore that one day "Bulava" without problems and that it will even ten nuclear a total weight of tonnes.

Czech discovery: a substance that operates on the HIV virus ""
A team of Czech and German new combinations that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the substance is that it is also on the virus that have already developed an immunity to the drugs..
is, in some cases, the upper hand on the fact that the combination is not as on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available. available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the present..
can prolong the life of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of the HIV virus in the body..
is, however, a series of side effects.
of this is the development of so-called resistant viruses on which the drugs have no effect...
The work of the three institutions, the National Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to cope with the resistance of the virus. the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt..
This combination is blocking the development of the virus in a different way of all drugs used to date and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new substances "improved", on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their routes on the from the virus.
The metalocarboranes have a single three-dimensional structure: two cages to multiple walls are formed by the atoms of, hydrogen and carbon and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt..
A traitor and.
The HIV is a protein of the HIV virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease there would be no birth of infectious particles of the virus.
If you stop the HIV protease, it will stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body of the patient, the researchers explained in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry at of the National Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically amended..
A little but more reliable..
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the HIV has been tested in test tubes and its variants, obtained from patients infected with HIV..
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on the clinical medicine, however it is not on the resistant against which the current drugs are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore interesting to consider more to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, "says Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the structural biology laboratory of the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics Institute of the National Academy of Sciences. of Sciences.
Dispute around the budget. The ODS is Fischer, who
The chairman of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), Mirek Topolánek has described as "staggering" the budget for the following year, and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should call into question its existence.
The Prime Minister has called the remarks of the ODS of drastic verdict..
He said take time to analyze.
The spokesman of the Petr said that the idea of a supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party more.
According to, the head of the government should decide whether ilprend in the Chamber of Deputies support on the minority who cares to combat the growing deficit, or if it is to remain in his post with the assistance of the left...
has warned that the positions of the ODS and Social Democrats in relation to the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed..
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday, the budget for the year 2010, however, with the proposed amendments to the tune of 12 billion included by the left.

The government's against the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they indirectly the budget deficit..
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of $163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, obeying the wishes of the government as a budget is a variant less bad than a budget.
and
The Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still consider the current situation.
is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave his office in case of ratification of the proposed changes, the situation might be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota made an appointment on Monday with Prime Minister after its passage through the government::
said at the same time, that he wondered if he would remain in his office..
His disappointment with the negotiations on the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight against the budget deficit, believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, which have imposed changes in the budget, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit, such as those affecting the health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the law on services.
Topolánek: ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case of the head of the government Fischer and the government.

said that if Fischer decides to give his resignation in the face of a fight against the amount of the deficit in the public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority which is currently in the House.".
That said, it should not expect the support and tolerance of Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once that it will be on the agenda when I, said since the House to journalists, the Defence Minister Martin, elected to government by the Democrats...
The Prime Minister Fischer has in the afternoon for a discussion of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has backtracked at the request of the Prime Minister.
stressed at the same time that the ODS would probably have voted on Wednesday against the amended budget if he had not specifically asked Democrats to allow the vote on the budget.
We do not have the feeling of being orphaned, it is not small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not been from the President of the Party in the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget..
I have not noticed that my vote would have been lacking.
I already knew when I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a bolchévisation of the House and the destruction of all that was positive, reacted in person.

The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If the last year or earlier, you will have to pay yourself the following vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the third and the fifth month of the child.
Last year a quarter of families has voluntarily vaccinated their children against.
Yet parents paid or even more for a dose.
The vaccination of young requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year the health insurance spend 300 to 450 000 in doses of vaccine..

So far the state was spending approximately 500 000 per year for the vaccination of children..

If all children were vaccinated, it could consider a reduction of vaccinations "In the situation where the vaccine is such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination" said however Cabrnochová.

Vaccination against also marks a break from the fact that this is the first vaccination of children, which is financed by the insurance and not the state..

Islam can be French?
and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be lured by this new book, fans of the author's latest book, "Why the French do not like the headscarf" (2006), an elegant and well documented on an issue that has divided and concerned the country for the past 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today..
The last book by Mr. Bowen presents a much broader and more ambitious..
anthropologist, it does not only want to know what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country..
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now in France this queM. Bozen called "" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
A Muslim must marry in a mosque or at the town hall (or both)?
The evolution and the rights of homosexuals should be taught to young Muslims?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim?
A Muslim can use a banking system based on the interests to obtain a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern to the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, a Muslim Arab born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate until the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers of a Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia that today, are a small part of Muslims in Europe..
M Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secular nature of the French could be compatible..
But a compromise can be achieved only with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how the French politicians (and the intellectual elite if virulent of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make compromises with the secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, he detects a "of key values".
Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."

On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities have identified an supposed to prepare a plot to send five men of Northern Virginia in Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that the case would an extensive network of terrorist recruiters of the Internet in search of young men..
Investigators said they were a hidden, known as the name Saifullah, who invited these men in Pakistan after having discovered when one of them has made comments endorsing the waves on the video site YouTube video site on the Internet.
in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah, who tried to help them to reach the remote area of the tribal belt of Pakistan, home of and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani secret services, who was informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not involved in the conspiracy of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network. network.

However Evan Kohlmann, an expert of the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that the terrorist groups must also do more and more attention in recent years in the choice of the people they accept because the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods..
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow its recruitment model that so many other people have already? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is more and more on the Internet.

On a day when little has happened during the discussions on the climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists marched through the city, signs in English saying, 'There is no B "and one in Spanish, saying," The Earth said she has had enough. ".
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including the top model and photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the country home of his mother, Peru, has opened our eyes to the problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change are already happening. ".
is one of the reasons why I decided to join the march -- to get the word and to launch an appeal to the leaders of the world to take the right decisions that are fair, ambitious and, she said..
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.

When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "In fact, it is something that I did..
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "The event is important, I cannot hear what is happening outside."..
He observed that the march could be harmful or helpful to the..
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, "he said..

The results of the tests reveal persistent differences between the races
The federal report last week on the results in mathematics has brought good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District is still far behind the institutions, the report shows that the Grade 4 and 5 (cm1-cm2) are much greater progress in the past two years in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York..
But what is from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National of the progress of education) is the persistent gap between the results of and, both local and national..
The results of white children of Grade 4 (cm1) to have increased over the last two years, from 262 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their classmates increased by only three points, to 212...
The gap of success has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling just one point, from 245 to 244.
The result means for has not been included in the results of the tests because the sample was not large enough..
The overview over a period of six years is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in a class of Grade 4 (cm1), when the first report was published, the was 60 points (262 to 202)..
Although the results achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points..
Last week, some advocates in the District have expressed the concern that the rising celebrated by the Director of the group of educational institutions, Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were propelled by the white students who were already good elements..
would mean that we have raised the aggregate in considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, "said Jeff Smith, Director of Voice, a non-profit group that promotes equality in education in the District..
I do not jump for joy for one or two points earned, "said Kwame R. Brown (Democrat), Member of the Council of and whose daughter is in Grade 4, Eaton Elementary (elementary school).
Often critical of the management style of Rhee, Brown said that the message of the test results is that the middle schools (colleges) of the city desperately in need of attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect that.
But fear is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges)..
Rhee said that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, for classes end of elementary and early college who does not have the foundations of earlier in their school and who are lagging behind to their peers.
Each day, the mathematics curriculum for the (Kindergarten to Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and the real life experiences, as they have been put in place in the District by the former superintendent Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply believe that we must continue to work to provide better responses to these students of the class, said Rhee..
Others believe that the results of the raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less in order to reduce the gap..
is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of education at the University of California, Berkeley who studied the results of the tests of cities.
The conventional political solution is to spend your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
this targeting may have political repercussions that this important program..
But the problem, of course, is that as the other of schools, she is trying to use the middle class white and black.
We focus to ensure the development of a system of good schools.
We must strengthen our schools so that all families, regardless of where they come from, are confident that their children can be able to obtain an excellent public education..
Janey, now of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap étaitla duration of the traditional public school, today of 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with the Charter schools.
approximately 200 days to have the strength to change, "said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of its last year for 185 days, which it considers a" starting point "for an increase in the next contract..

In fact, "a Hispanic to the" second generation "on cinqpoursuit his studies at the - a notable success considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most from Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without having completed high school..

When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, does not help, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, Davis, who has studied Latin American students.
We need to provide a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school..
The federal program that has funded the visit of universities of is a good example.

American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, especially the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, including labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they had not to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the department.
The American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong links with the Iraqi Ministry of and brought their technical advice, left empty-handed..
The Russian companies, Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has more on contracts that other companies and is left with significant holdings in contracts for two main fields...
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, "said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese society will be on an equal footing with its competitors and will carry out its commitments in Iraq.
The companies to submit have made offers, which were then compared to the tariff per barrel that the department agreed to pay to motivate the production above current levels for each field..
One of the main organizers of al-Qaeda would have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that a missile, which hit along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of the operations of al-Qaeda, this week, said Friday of the U.S. authorities of.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected to have been killed by a pair of missiles in their car, Tuesday, near the town of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region..
Local authorities have said that the missiles had been fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside the lawless tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, "said a member of the secret services Pakistani civilians, speaking by telephone from Miran Shah..
of the authority said that local militant suspects rushed to place and were quickly confiscated what remained of "body completely."..
It was totally impossible to local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. counter-terrorism officials have given evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of the organizers military officials who ran the al-Qaeda terrorist the group's operations outside the region..
role was to organize conspiracies in the world, "said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the air strikes inside Pakistani territory..
Given its central role, this was included of attacks against the United States and Europe..
followed the instructions of strategic leaders of al-Qaeda and has translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks..
A second representative of the American authority said that Somali had progressed rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaida 's and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It is perhaps not known to the general public, but this does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, "said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, would be the second important figure of al-Qaeda or the Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks carried out by the CIA drones has declined since the summer, about six per month to two, according to the figures put forward by the Long War Journal, a Web site by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups who have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while killing also suspected, says the site.
The UN special envoy to Kabul withdrew
The UN special envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of corruption during the presidential elections, supported by the United Nations
The departure of Eide comes at a time when the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase, but it has expressed its concern about the the timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and that would require the other NATO governments to withdraw their forces..
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, to send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, "said Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat has also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international staff helping the political transition in Afghanistan..
The increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said that he did not resign but that it would the commitment he had made to his family, in March, will spend two years in Kabul..
He said that he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I simply said that it was better to start for my replacement, said.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival..
According to the representatives of the United Nations, Ban has already begun to look for a replacement.
The representatives argue that the name of Staffan di Mistura was quoted; it is a citizen who recently chaired a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who had previously led the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations..
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused in September, President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and to conceal evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has denied these allegations, but he said that the accusations of Galbraith - who was thanked - "have the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism as regards the international observation of".
Eide said that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of American forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the Heads of the United Nations to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that it is assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence about how their money is spent.
Eide has expressed his frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy regulations of the United Nations impeded its ability to bring new talent.
The rules of the United Nations rules are such that I could not to recruit a single person since May, he said. said.
It is catastrophic, and it cannot last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking before a crowd of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a visit to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has dédramatisé the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such an outcome.
One of the things that weighs me the most, is that if I learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates has reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the street..
He said that "a set of incentives and punishments" might be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact be less good security with nuclear weapons "because" his people would suffer 'of these sanctions. these sanctions.
Friday, in a statement from the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined the European leaders in warning that Iran will face the consequences "probable" if it does not its nuclear programme in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)..
Iran continues to say that he wants to develop its nuclear experience only in a peaceful purposes.
In the Geneva talks on October 1, he indicated that it would resume dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to give up a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium, in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor...
The administration has prompted such an agreement, confidence on both sides and to win time for negotiations...
Since then, Iran appears to be attempts to - in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States...
Frankly, I think, the of Iran to some of the proposals of the international community to which they had in fact given their agreement in early October, has prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join what they had not considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, "said Gates. Gates
President Obama has set a December 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before it turns to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions.".
In a statement made Thursday in New York, the mission of Iran's mission to the United Nations has denounced what it called "baseless allegations" of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities of Iran and said it was agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to obtain a satisfactory solution in the long term"..
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before the plane to the oil rich region of Kurdish derencontrer the troops to Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil..
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly concerning the borders, property rights and the sharing of revenues.
Gates has urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays of US plans to reduce the number of American troops, 115 000 to 50 000 before the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the anxiety of Kurds concerning the withdrawal. The American authorities have quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.".
We will not abandon you. "
In China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by the propaganda poster, "The Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "A baby, it is a more".
have learned the lesson that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the lack of birth rate of their city and the ageing of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their response has been instantaneous and firm:..
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
There is no second, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources and who has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of children with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed the "little emperors", a crisis of the population threatens the country..
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over will explode, 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of the Shanghai Municipal and) said that the fertile couples to have babies in order "to help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and to prevent a lack of manpower in the future."..
Shanghai is on the verge of becoming "too old - but not as rich, however, that the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A
in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is to this day, without doubt, the most controversial requirement introduced by the Communist government.
who violate this policy may have to pay huge fines - up to three times their annual income - and suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the country to avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while the lawyers for human rights have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced women pregnant with a second child to have abortions.
In addition, many couples have used to selective abortions leading to a ratio of boys girls abnormally high..
In recent years, the authorities of the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they have been more exceptions to the rule - including for residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which the man and woman are already - and in 2007, they have softened much of their slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research (Institute of Population Research), at Peking University, said that the authorities of the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai has become the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, the posters encouraging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of regulations who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for..
The city government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples, at their home, and under their door..
He has also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
response
officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples wanting a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of, for example, is still only four to five requests per month.
in Shanghai, disappointed, said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be only about 165 000 - slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee of family planning in the municipality of Caolu of Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to fill their first child, she said.
Yang, 27 years and his wife, Liu, 26 years, said they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed..
But like many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life assurance given by the government.
Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The mistakenly see that the one-child policy is a problem of rights, "said Yang, a construction engineer, whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It is true, we are the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
It is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, of Human Resources, said she wanted only a single child because she was itself. "We were at the centre of the family and had used that everyone cares." ""
We do not have the habit of taking care of someone else, and we really do not want to take care of others. ""
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a translation company puts it more bluntly.
For couples working at two, middle class, which the birth rate, he says, he must be selfish pourbien succeed.
of 20 or 30 years have grown up seeing their parents struggle in the early days of the capitalist and do not want to have themselves this way of life, "he says.
Even one child a lot of time with his parents, "he says..
A mother must abandon at least two years of her social life.
there are the problems of space - "You you must change your apartment" - and planning - "When your child has only 9 months, you need to write his CV for a place in the best mother tongue." "
Most of his friends are willing to this experience once again, said Chen, but not both..
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, "he says.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
The Group of the United Nations has plans for the reduction of emissions emissions
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations characterized by and mutual recriminations - is back in under the spotlight Friday, due to the publication of a document outlining the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations supporting most of the burden in the coming years time.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, said the remaining obstacles, as it has informed the path to take..
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that are short of time, with more than 100 world leaders from arriving next week in Copenhagen.
by a special working group of the United Nations, the text does not say how many rich countries would give to the poor to cope with global warming, short and long term...
And it offers a wide range of options for the key issues, including how the developed economies and the emerging economies could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, Representative àWashington of the Sierra Club..
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has written six pages of the document, has studied a text of 180 pages to focus on what was described by the Secretary-General on the United Nations climate change, Yvo de Boer, as "the full picture."..
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations reduce their emissions in 2020, from 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries, during the same period, reduced by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched the negotiations, Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change - to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercation occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, US Representative of the United States to the negotiating climate has rejected any discussion the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, in comparison with the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed countries. developed countries..
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming harder to China that the Bush administration has been, it was two years ago...
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of the major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text does not enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, He Yafei has said that the chief negotiator, "common sense", was "extremely irresponsible" for having said earlier in the week that the United States would not financially China to combat global warming..
With the future economic trajectories of the world's major powers involved, defects both within the and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more concerned with the rescue of individual economies that the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States querellant on their respective obligations while poorer nations insist on the fact that the two dozen countries the most influential countries ignore scientific imperatives to act more boldly..
Ricardo ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters accountable for their actions.
It really is a game in which has developed a new economic hegemony, said ulate, who is also on the climate for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put pressure for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that the negotiations will lead to a minimum, a political agreement..
The Alliance of Small Island States which brings together 43 members, has drafted a proposal for a Treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the unit of the European Commission, said that the action of small island states has "put political pressure on the political process is complete,", in part by what they are now and they emerging economies such as China and India, to act....
The debates have become a matter of urgency, while delegates focused on the fact that they should solve most of the problems pending before the heads of governments come to an agreement.
officials such as the Indian Minister of the environment minister, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese are descended from their plane and rushed into the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings in camera and conferences of information, in order to make claims that will be considered during the following week.
The real image of the -- in which people and out of the Palais des each day activists guitar players are mocking countries which they will and that proposals are and distributed on paper rather than by - is a real challenge real.
The intensity is: almost all key ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the big boys, "said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of Conservation International.

In Britain, the first train to 225 km / h will redefine the Monday
5h13, Monday morning, a whistle the night to signal the start of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain..
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km / h, whereas it filera of Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first commuter train outside London.
He hoped that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast trains and reliable and will link the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland in London...
The small holes will become, business travel will be much less long and the passage of the plane and the car to the train will reduce national emissions of carbon, while reducing congestion on the roads. on on the roads
In theory, the three main political parties to this project..
But the 10 billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the battle of planning and fears of dangers to the environment the high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company established in January for the government to conduct a feasibility report, will make his document to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres in the final itinerary.
It is also expected that HS2 offers three options for a high-speed network, the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a configuration in for which a high-speed line will go up to the West Midlands.
The line will into two at or near Birmingham, with a branch from the west of the Pennines àManchester and Scotland and another to the, Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne. upon Tyne.
A single line through Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best option for performance 'said a professional rail.
When this is completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes..
The first part, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a an hour now.
The proposals will allow the train to travel 400km / h, making the British network the fastest in the world..
The route is designed to allow trains to long and can carry people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a line from London to Birmingham.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the constraints of space, it is anticipated that an existing station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
The rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he feels that the project should be put in place, but public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will be built by.
The trains will be forced to roll out of high-speed lines on the existing track north of Birmingham, journey times between London and Scotland more than three hours.
This seems to be the best solution to ensure a to trains, a reference point for the revolution of...

I liked what he said, "said Ms. Palin, égérie of the right wing of the Republican Party, the USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the issue of the war" sometimes necessary "in his memoirs that have just been published.
The war is, of course, is the last thing in my view that the Americans want to do, but it is necessary...
We must stop these terrorists out there, "she said.
Mr. Obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, has worked Thursday to Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan nine days earlier.

For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush columnist for the Washington Post, Mr. Obama has delivered "a" very American ".
In addition to appear in "citizen of the world" as "it always does," he spoke as an American president, "the Europeans" that they live in a bubble of security that they have not created and that they do little to preserve it, "said Mr. Gerson.
Among the few right to not be convinced, a of the Bush era, the former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, has called the speech "dull, and without inspiration" on the National Review Online.
the left of the president, the Democrat Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When the war in the concept of justice, it can easily justify the massacre of innocent people, "he warned...
The press remained of the president...
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.

The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party in the country, a decision which was immediately followed by expressions of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul..

The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP to obey the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal policy of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, that there was "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court comes at a time when the government is to reach out to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to the support of to the PKK and put an end to the conflict.

That is why the head of must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And Stuttgart also: a train station of passage of trains, which is located about halfway on the Transeuropéenne of the rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava where the slogan "the heart of Europe"..

However, it is now the achievement of Stuttgart 21 to the new route of the line Ulm.
regional and local policies prevailed..
The railway company is part, because it is the taxpayer who is the cost of the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public company.

For the system of rail transport the is harmful.
The station and the enlargement of the section are designed for a trafficking - and this is typical of the 1980s - an enormous growth.
At the time there was not yet competition from cheap flights.
The of modern traffic policy should first concentrate on strengthening the traffic of goods transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road..
But the new route, with its, is not suitable for freight trains...
The, and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the draft of the.

Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is for sure, in the next decade this money for other points and congestion in the network..
The list of the Ministry of Transport said in all major projects..
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section through the Rhine Valley of 180 kilometres.
Since 1987 the line is built in.

But the project is the effect of a.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck of international freight traffic, and this in the heart of Europe.

More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words "in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that a work of the poet Werner Söllner, in which he in snippets of, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who won freedom but lost at the same time its territory.. territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and, subsequently, director of collection in a publishing house for youth before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner received various literary prizes; in 1993 he took the highly coveted poetry of the Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002, he is director of the forum of of Hesse in the house of artist of Mousonturm in Frankfurt...
has been much talk of him in circles not last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "The German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your"..
upset and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow writers germano-roumains as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had worked as an informant for the Securitate political police policy..
Söllner received in 1989, the price of the German language together with some of the participants..
The began in 1971.
I am, therefore, "Söllner" someone who has not sufficiently auxessais intimidation of the Securitate. "
The Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoration award of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his literary with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, in a case that clearly shows the and of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.. espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say with the current state of knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim..
In his own Securitate file, Walter played a role, the specialist Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and it refers to the positive influence of Walter, who had interceded in its favour on his behalf..
"had from all the difficult situations at the time," according to Markel...
has felt the need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident of its collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact, not so surprising..
Germany is a pleasant for spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper, "Die Zeit," after reading the 914 pages of his own record..
can assume that the victims have made speculation and sometimes have guessed what real names were last names of Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Germany, where between the of the files of the Stasi is a reliable process, the attitude to the legacy of the files of the is still very confused.
A systematic clarification was constantly frustrated and in past years.
It was not only in 1999 that a national council to the institution Birthler was created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS) but the of files has since.

The joy of the of the successor of Babbel was moderate.
And the joy was not only among those who had brought luck, which had sent to professionals of Stuttgart, highly motivated and fun to play.
I was to see the players and I told them that they should focus on their strengths, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "plumber" - the recipe for success that if bienmais was did more with the Babbel...
It has triggered a certain magic, Jens Lehmann - supporter of Babbel - "in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that we would never have thought possible.".
Sami Khedira who, after weeks of break for injury, advanced to the of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" found by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of work of the new leader: "is someone who goes to the action and requires discipline.

We have not yet out of the.
Heldt on the day of its 40th anniversary does not have the heart to make the party, even after the first victory at home over the past three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a television interview of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann did bounce back just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others and not Jens, Heldt, in response to the criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the of weakness of style and said that it had decided to change under pressure from fans..
Lehmann had also seen as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele fact that his day of freedom after the matches had been deleted.
The statements of Lehmann were "marked by a pure selfishness" Heldt and announced the consequences for the.

The case
frontal attack the opposition: the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, has accused the Ministry of Defence Minister of lying in the case of the Kunduz..
The SPD party and the Left () the Chancellor explanations..
Hamburg / Berlin - After a review of the latest information on the air attack in Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) have délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The Minister has intentionally "made an untruth" on the deadly strike two last September, said the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the broadcast of information of the ARD "Tagesschau" (the newspaper).).
, this means that he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
It is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said.
Last Friday, according to new revelations of the media, the objective of lafrappe was in reality, not to destroy the stolen trucks, but was intended to eliminate two important Taliban leaders..
According to the report of NATO, 142 people had been killed or injured in the US air attack which was launched at the request of the German Klein, military commander of Kunduz..
The Greens, the SPD and the Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to decide as soon as possible before the federal Parliament and to reveal what really knew about the incident..
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast are of the opinion that Mrs Angela Merkel must clearly say whether the strategy of targeted killings is part of the Government's policy if the Chancery, the army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy. strategy.
The spokesman of the Government categorically rejects such criticism..
The has in no way influenced the interventions of the army in Afghanistan, he said.
Saturday, were increasingly strong to express doutesquant the real reasons for the dismissal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as it had been presented by the department..
According to the information of the newspaper, the information that they had handed over to Guttenberg concerning the attack were both correct and complete...
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the report of NATO and the Minister some details..
In the entourage of two senior officials suggests, however, that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner" reports that Wichert would have meanwhile asked in a letter of clarification of the facts. facts.
So far, it has not received a

The worlds of the
Some see, awake, images and hear voices that nobody else sees or hears..
It is not only that among the patients, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between fantasy and reality blur..
these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is going very well.
When we are lying in our rooms, we can do without hindrance to the dreams and the wildest fantasies...
However, awake, the state of dream, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, has a reputation in the western world to be crazy or drugged, or at the very least to be an original.
Such images and voices do not appear that the mental ill or under the influence of drugs..
It is our imagination that is at: it is the same neural activity which allows us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, but sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality to merge..
A state of aware, taking in the form of a dream, may be in various forms, in the best of we call it visions, at worst madness. madness..
But even if the trigger and the effect, the visions of the Hildegard von Bingen, the experiences of of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the latter, and hallucinations are attributable to process very similar.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, of neurotransmettrices in the brain - dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and the achétylcholine - breaks down and that the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted.
and delusional thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis..
The force of attraction has more power on the person.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between the madness and the dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of rêve-éveillé; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "a great similarity between the madness and the dream," Sigmund Freud the dream was "a psychosis with all irregularities, imagination, and sensory illusions and". "
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning turns into a comic strip.
His body is in two dimensions to the colours.
The attraction of has more power over him, there is the of the ceiling..
feels a coup.
Behind him creatures of ailées, grimaçantes, his mouth bloodied, showing the teeth.
They continue, give with heavy boots, the cast against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body..
voice,,, walls and the radio.
It can no longer bear these voices who insult and humiliate..
Henning two cables of its, in fact a loop and attached to a hook attached to the ceiling.
on a baffle and the loop around the neck.
..
The loop stands out.
will serve as a lesson, the voice in a chorus to extract the. "in a clinic and fais-toi treat!"
Today Henning 40 years ago, he lived six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first of nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective, paranoid, furthermore, it is maniaco-dépressif, he takes medication for depression, mania, and schizophrenia..
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
During the I terrible and deep despair...
The illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers from at least once in his life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics that is the most common illness after the depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, people can no longer tell the difference between the inside and the outside world, they are in a state of, which that they may suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational or persecution. or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices -, who or dialogue..
The hallucinations are not rare.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the, the brain can no longer filter the signals, is drowned in the sensations..
Just as the dream, opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies of deeper layers of conscience.
The perception of reality in is focused on the issue, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry University of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Universitätsklinikum).)
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the situation, a focused on him.
At the same time it is found in a passive role, it is like a dream, overcome by events and may not act on them.
is the reason why people with schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general, they do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality, the illusions are a cruel reality, wake up is excluded.
once in a life of a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory structure and space to the reality that is seen during the psychosis, is".
The thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the lived in a real framework..
Why our this kind of, is still a mystery to researchers.
Exceptional situations can bring everyone to lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs..
But only a small number of people develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only..
assume that the persons involved are tiny brain damage.
It is assumed that the maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, "Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is how the anomaly of the system occurs and also the fact that it is not seen for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, however, if there is a predisposition.
the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger because they act on the.
When our brains..
This is crazy, "said Professor of Psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that the suffer from hallucinations and psychotic take expensive to dispose of while others buy drugs very expensive to obtain..
The perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten brings together for ten years of reports on the hallucinations and phenomena of images: Last year he published his results in a book entitled "The world in our heads." "
The hallucinations are part of phenomena typical of but also an impressive number of many other diseases.
include the psychological problems such as borderline or depression but also the migraine headaches, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising that in certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally are inhibited.
They form when the areas of the brain that deal with sensory perceptions, are not enough hyperactives or refrénées; when our but also when there is a lack of stimulation.
The drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, the of love or other mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants acknowledged having made at least once in a lifetime experience of a hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. 16 years ago, she lives in a small town in and it goes to the school.
A young girl to normal..
If there was not the images and voices.
During the recess, sometimes a young boy, thin, with long hair, to address him the floor..
When she meets his watch, surprised nobody else sees or hears this boy. boy.
They believe that this is a shy girl is a lunatic but Sarah K does not dream, it is certain.
is awake, and sees the boy as she sees and hears the girl who is sitting next to her on the bench.
It may even his presence.
It is a good feeling, she found that young sympathetic.
Am I crazy?, wondered sometimes.
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
The night appearances are, in general, are frightening.
Often the visions are cumbersome.
When she is in class, it that it can monitor the course because the professor is just to present a new student in his eyes and ears when it is invisible to others and that the professor is clearly trying to explain the equations in..
The night appearances are, in general, are frightening.
When, in the darkness of his room, it sleep that too little and far too late, it often cannot distinguish if it is or dream already, if the images that she sees, faces grimaçants or the girl with cuts on his arms and legs are before its eyes open or closed.
Let me, to these creatures.
It does not to his parents or friends, they would take to a mad.
Fall 2009. Sarah has now 20 years old.
had last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations have ceased.
Since it came into contact via the Internet with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that it is not crazy..
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or has not sufficient incentives, the likelihood is that he has hallucinations after a certain period of time.
I assume that the brain is not, ensures that there is animation.
Sarah K., single girl, was afraid of the other children when she was small and often played alone.
hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years, that the man she called Daddy, since it was in age to think, was not his real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active in the visual and acoustic, and for the impressions and, it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to the difference between the illusion and reality. "experience," according to "takes place in the brain, the reality is formed from there..
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real. ""
For Kasten, dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychosis.
the schizophrenic, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that the fantasies are not real images..
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish the hallucinations as a special talent.
There is only a step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on the conscience has unfortunately been quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and chief of the and Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf. in Düsseldorf
A is a serious disease, painful but which also contains something positive, creator - the madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-degenhard Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the form of so-called oniroïde experience, a particular form of the amendment of the conscience by the dream.
The experienced oniroïdes are very complex which are seen as real by the lives and that it cannot differentiate the dream even when it is in a state of..
The state of consciousness oniroïde occurs during a trauma or in situations of extreme as for patients with polyradiculopathie which fully aware, experience a paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of itself and the world, due to a total inability and to move, it replaces the real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world who is divorced from reality. from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between the dream and the hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of the world, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, a form of means and interpretation, in a situation in itself, an organizational capacity that we have is given to us, men, not to sink into the abyss of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian also describes his experiences oniroïdes in his book "Change of Heart" as action to safeguard the soul.
was 49 years ago, when his for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed a transplant; during this time, his body was sentenced to remain in resuscitation...
Claussen plunged into a world that he has created from scratch, visit places, travel in time. It is old man in a sanatorium rail, a robot at his bedside care on his health..
He lives in the middle ages among the who manufacture of drugs based on blood.
was abducted by a Greek who takes in his country, he is riding with his hospital bed in the Alps and meeting a Korean..
It is completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to these domestic trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a quite different, "he wrote in describing what he lived..
Instead of dreams, memories from travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later. later.
can even say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real lived..
The intensity of this the horizon of our other everyday experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard. Schmidt-Degenhard
Ultimately, the oniroïdes, delusions, hallucinations and experiences show us how our representations of the external reality are fragile, even in a state of..
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist Kasten "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
experience that can also be very rewarding.

The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to watch his e-mail, without offering the possibility if only to see some type of attachments or surf the Internet.
It took advantage of its five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike, offers a price and a very low, less than half of what it costs, for example, the subscription data of the iPhone.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service to life, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is also limited its grand-frère American, but is a surprise..
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with a already know what it means the to the data when it crosses a border or seek a cafeteria on the (or a connection of) to consult his mail..
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it is a long time that it should operate..
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have a in physics to understand and good glasses to read the small print.
repeated reminders to the order of the European Commission to propose roaming fees throughout Europe have had a barely perceptible...
Outside his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and it was not wrong.
A small device as the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon does not have the) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are beginning to think differently and are studying various proposals to make their data network..
Kindle is another good example, it includes the downloading of books and other research on the Internet.
Without subscription and without.
It is a device connected and pay at its purchase and not every month..
And that is what I hope to see a day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with access to life as the is already in the United States.
that I do not want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I would simply because I believe that this is a more fair formula for the consumer. the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The colour of Michelle
is, without doubt, the colour of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the inauguration of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat of this, it has, in effect, chosen the same to accompany him in the second time, without a doubt, the most important of his life: the of the Nobel Peace Prize...
Michelle Obama wore a very similar in these two occasions: in addition to their, a yellow towards the green with bright, both times, the consisted of three parts: the dress, the jacket and the, in the same, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a necklace..
a first glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States to follow in the wake of the Princess of Asturias and chose to the same...
But the fabric in which are both sets are very different..
If for the it was a thick, however, it was in a printed velvet..
The accessories are also are different: to means for the first time, and a similar model, but, this time..

75% of working mothers have had problems because of their maternity
at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers. mothers.
is what the study "and professional career women in Spain," conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer..
The survey, conducted on 9 737 women aged 15 to 75 years, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers saw their professional career limited because of motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences concerning the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, whether or not the woman works or not, and the type of job. job.
Those who do not work outside the home, working part-time or have a stable, earlier in the couple, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children. children.
In contrast, women with a stable job, mainly in the public sector, the entry in the life as a couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women aged between 35 and 49 years with a fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after being installed as a couple. This figure rises to among those who work in the public sector. "These data show that women with a stable employment needed more time in their lives for it, which led to the union and the arrival of children. of
In addition, the type of employment exercised influence, but less than the start date of common life together, "said the researcher of the Margarita Delgado..
The level of education is another factor that is widening the gap in the age of marriage for women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training is high, the more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference is also among the women of the same generation.
For example, in the group aged between 35 and 49 years, those who have elementary and higher, respectively mothers for the first time to and years on average..
"Another disctinction is also between women, according to their level of education.
While those who have elementary school marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those with average level or higher this program and give priority to obtaining a stable work as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child, "said Ms. Delgado.. Ms. Delgado.

A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighbourhood of the city of, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent beside her and our dog, a sang-mélé, saved from the and not weighing more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they assenèrent two the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is great because we do not see what to attack a small animal which, moreover, was on a leash...
to the indignation of a woman who was walking and, when these individuals, came to fear for his physical integrity, since a énergumène attack an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, lower than him.
The episode took place at around 5 p.m., Tuesday as another, in a usually quiet neighborhood..
The dog was gémi throughout the day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint to the police station in the although we doubt that much, and not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish..
The has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people so that they find amusing to a defenceless animal gives us the, friendship and company. company.

The sale of light commercial vehicles is
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles are beginning to see a little light at the end of the tunnel..
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the employers' union of and Ganvam, the number of dealers.
, however, the good news, since the reference for the comparison, the month of November 2008, has been particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
, despite the rebound last month, the accumulated during the 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if you add up all vehicles entering into the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, light trucks, vans, and chassis) 95 have been sold.
clouds that most affect their are not so. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized businesses, which pay in almost 100% of cases through an external funding..
Thus, in addition to the restrictions by the limitation of bank loans, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic climate..
Faced with this situation and the passenger vehicles, aid for the purchase of the 2000E have little used...
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of emissions of does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, in Ganvam, it recalled again the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers' association provides a year 2010 similar to that ends, for which she calculates a drop in sales (for passenger cars and) of 19%...
emergency braking is now mandatory
As has occurred with the ABS anti-lock system and as it will take place with the ESP stability control systems, to emergency will be a compulsory element on European cars....
They are already mandatory on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles registered, while for the rest of the vehicles a waiting period was set up at the end of February 2011..
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by its mode of action, it can also help to prevent many rear shocks.
The assistant emergency braking is increasing the pressure on the brakes in an emergency cases detected by the system through the kick given by the driver..
But it does not always maintained the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to build on the brakes before the collision, and half of them had not taken advantage of its strength.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in revancha, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop. stop.
According to a study of the EU, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: It calculates that a disaster on four, with casualties would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to act on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it increasing the pressure on the pedal, if this is necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device is the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize the damage.

Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya

After days roses since last spring, during which the asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty there again, which is not surprising since it is to their natural state, in an environment where the officers take decisions on a future uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize the markets has been to monetize the debt by the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing ample liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize..
Central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have been virtually and, without their political maverick of liquidity, begin to put a bit of sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with their award to a one year in the next week.
, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic recovery without measures and we are seeing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums. premiums.
The volatility of stock markets and the obligations of again, although they remain very distant paranormaux levels that they have achieved at the beginning of the year..
were forced to socialize the risk private and public debt is again.
There is a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the shelters by investors, causing an increase of differences between the countries of the euro zone and Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a new downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral hazard, who trying to provoke a case of conscience among lesresponsables of global economic policy that had hampered the destructive effects of the credit on the destruction of employment, what we should do is a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation of Dubai resembles a fight between the tribal sheiks to restore its place in power in the emirates and we have already seen in the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that uncovered the roses.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be totally irrational that the Ecofin saves Hungary a respect of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country of the euro area not to meet its commitments..
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has prompted the Greek government transparency and makes its citizens the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of of risk premiums, after some excesses in high positions, it would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, as our differences of public debt increase to the extent of the obligations of European companies, nousn 'not have to worry...
If the European and that our people continued to increase, it would be a risk.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our most of the services of studies to anticipate their models of recovery and to revise up their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, who returned to the with a Japanese model Spanish economy, it does not much hope for their warning...
Again, this has to be an excellent opportunity to buy assets in Spain, even if for the moment "caution is the mother of safety".
