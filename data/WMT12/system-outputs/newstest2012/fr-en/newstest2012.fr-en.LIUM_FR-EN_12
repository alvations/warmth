Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament has refused, in the framework of an amendment to the criminal law, the project of cancellation of the paragraph on the charge of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
Members have declined in the second reading of the draft amendment reducing sentences for economic crimes, which could open the doors of freedom for the former First Minister currently in prison.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having reached an agreement in principle disadvantageous with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must rule on the appeal of the sentenced in December.
Tymosenko describes the judgment of political revenge of the regime and has caused a process of suspicion of bias of the court also to the west.
The project to cancel the paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former First Minister was sentenced, has been signed by 147 Members.
It would have needed 226 votes to approve.
Libyan Victory
The release or Libyan rebellion already has his vanquished.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to determine the winners.
As is customary in the region, the victors in the elections are the Islamists, but is it moderates or radicals.
The National Council has declared the customary law of Sharia law and we already know what it is.
Libya is a country without crime, because for a flight, the hand.
Women can forget the emancipation, not respectful of the faith face the death penalty...
It is the Koran which will unite in place of the personality of the dictator society composed of tribes opposed.
In Libya, such an order as we cannot we represent and we would certainly not.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and probably would not be advantageous for the.
It is particularly surprising that the Islamic warriors have accepted the help with recognition of dogs infidels.
The only excuse is that this is not a U.S. general who led the NATO strikes but Allah they celebrated the greatness in each attack.
When it comes to seek the victors in Libya, the West is not part
We have involved the firing, served Islam and our policies are diverted the dictator as a political ally without bringing any benefit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily Libya.
There is no problem for the premises to get rid of the "crusaders.".
Is that without occupation of soil, oil companies have easy access to Libyan oil.
Perhaps not as much and the West can finally boast an unselfish protection of human rights.
If we prevent these followers of Sharia law.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the sights of investors.
A tornado statistics rose Tuesday on Europe.
Each of the states has published information relating to GDP 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market beats all records.
Investors look not only Italy but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The offices of statistics in the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have published earlier their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
The GDP of Germany has forecast growth of 0.5 percent, that of France 0.4%.
The two countries have changed the data for the second quarter during which Germany is better placed than expected (growth of 0.3 percent instead of the 0.1 percent expected), however France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (he was at the origin of stagnation).
The Czech economy has been a growth of 1.5 percent during the third quarter.
But the GDP has stagnated and according to the Bureau of the Czech statistical it is confirmed that we are moving towards a gradual reduction of economic growth.
The results were worse than analysts' forecasts.
The most important:
The Czech economic growth has been a 1.5% during the third quarter but has stagnated for the last quarter.
The German economy has been in the third quarter growth of 0.5% according to data provided and recalculated periodically.
The economy of the euro zone and the European Union has been a growth of 0.2% between July and September from the previous quarter, which corresponds to what analysts had expected.
The Greek economy fell 5.2 percent.
The yield on the 10-year bonds is 28,45 percent
Yields of the bonds of Spain and Italy are up to the limits.
The problems are beginning to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
The Czech bond yields continue to - below 4 percent while the situation worsens in the region.
Some voices in Germany to say that the ECB should be the guarantee of last instance.
The Czech Republic qualified for Euro.
They have won in Montenegro 1: 0 and celebrating qualification for 200 million
The representation of football has managed its most difficult mission of the season.
In Montenegro, she also won the super Cech and goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1: 0.
The Czech football has dearly also defended with a good chance in the second part its qualification and will not fail the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualification game with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and much chance for the second.
The Czech representation also won the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1: 0 in Montenegro and celebrates its qualification for the European Championship.
The monténégrains found themselves under pressure in the second part because of a Czech defence.
The victims of the game have been Damjanovic and Vucinic who have missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and a reward of 200 million kronor in the fund of the Czech football.
From the first minutes we played a football warrior.
The two teams were hardly climbing combinations and the game has concentrated mainly around the central line.
The pressure of national footballers is not here to break the Czech defence who responded to the long shots during the first half - time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They have created a human shield
A few hundreds of students graduate schools have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support by this gesture the nuclear programme of their countries face a possible Israeli attack.
The students went to pray at noon in front of the site and then called the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Isfahan have created a human shield Tuesday around the Isfahan nuclear technology centre where uranium is transformed.
They have openly expressed they would defend the nuclear program of their countries, risking their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found in its latest information that Iran has not stopped strengthening its nuclear weapons.
It was reported in Israel about a possible attack Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students went to pray at noon in front of the site and then called the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose aim would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear program, the targets would be not only Isfahan, but also the Natanz site where is enriched uranium.
The feeding of a child obese: does not take breakfast and takes the deli for lunch
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 years have problems on weight, 9% of pupils are a weight in the - above the average and 5 percent are obese.
As the current research obese children come from families who have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows once again how important is the environment in which the human being and models that surround it.
On the tables of obese children is by example of the deli 50 percent more often than in the families of children with normal weight.
19% of obese had fries at the dinner, according to the survey conducted with an awareness "Obesity is not a chance"
In the families of small big sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most schoolchildren today - only 15 percent said that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey on 900 children
The survey was conducted during the last school year and participated 900 students of primary schools of the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of the "Obesity is not a chance", supported by General Insurance and the company Unilever.
 Since the start is more than 12,000 students from sixth to third that project.
One of the factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of children in on weight or obese, is the lack of proper food and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half the children interviewed indicated by example eat five times a day - breakfast, lunch, dinner, tea party, which is a basic principles of good nutrition," said one of the results of the investigation.
Without breakfast and dinner deli
Specialists draw attention to the fact that a healthy development takes a few basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of the families of pupils to eat my same hour.
In most families each takes his breakfast alone.
And the worst that has been raised is that a tenth of the population does not breakfast.
The breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.
The survey showed that in the families of the obese children consumes more often unhealthy fries.
Almost every pupil - not to mention weight – drink every day from sweetened drinks (70%).
More than 40% of children questioned the sport regularly but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Bring you your diet
Another part of the investigation has allowed children chosen (204 172 boys and girls of 13 schools) to prepare its own food from options, according to their taste and their own personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children 12 to 15 years are far, in terms of a healthy diet, the ideal.".
Among their favourite meals there is a lot of cakes, meat and sweets.
"The more alarming is a large preference for sweet lemonades," is indicated in the survey results.
For lunch the pasta who took first place just before the white meat.
The children were not want starches and preference for fish and vegetable meal was very low.
Cape on health
The investigation has also shown that children are ready to change their habits from the time they receive the ad hoc information.
"During a control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the session awareness" Obesity is not a chance ", there was a definite desire to move towards a healthy diet," the results of the investigation.
The most striking example was the sweetened lemonades because children have begun to give preference to water consumption.
The children were most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as a main dish and reduce the dishes and sugary "knedliky" (Czech speciality flour balls of bread or potatoes).
The designer should also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation on the way to learn for the designers, I put myself a little angry because there was a lot from the beginning.
I didn't what would happen afterwards.
The presentations of three professionals, specialty clothing characters and a seminar on what is going on.
And it will be worse.
As we approach the final exams and we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays is truly "packed.".
This time we have with the director Alenka (over there is no boy) Treaty of how to dress the woman who has no standard measurements.
And women of this type is the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a body of boy, without particular curve, another of the on weight.
The designer should know how to reduce arms optically, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We arrived nicely to emphasise the character and also not to pay way too ostentatiously types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and hips and a size.
If there is a difference between the waist and hips so that skirts or pants are not at all, this is the time to do it.
And you will never regret it because the clothing that is impeccably is invaluable.
In a skirt on able you will feel much better than in the slips, is enroule and does not take the belt and so on.
For those who have a male appearance can afford a lifestyle clothing Tucker, with pieces of tissue producing rather threadbare, and even embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am pleased that I have all week to sort through all the information received.
But I also fear that because I have to do at home there too.
Each trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of mode of personality and his appearance.
I will have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, that maybe you know the campaign the Secret of Victoria.
Basically, it gives me pleasure, because it is better than dress Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who took almost 100 kilograms lately (don't take my statement, above, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We must cut and sew from magazines or look on the internet, print and graphic design work.
The Moodboard, as we said to the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with the graphic design.
Think also on the part of the graphic styling is also important.
The designer dresses and did not only physical but creates the productive pages in magazines (on products given the trends for handbags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and designer, has spoken of it all.
But this... until Sunday
The designer should have a general vision
Three guests of specialty have given a diverse aspect to the Saturday session filled with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, Jakub Polanka, designer and fashion designer Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the designer should know.
And a designer of talent is working with a single dress differently.
The variability is to this example.
As for example the trench-coat who must be brought a classic with a jeans and a T-shirt as a light coat but it can also clothe the naked body, with court shoes and photo taken as a dress.
Or just the sleeves or collar and immediately have a new look.
"Concentrate on with this," he said.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For the work you need to know the rules well.".
"You can then begin to infringe," said Jakub.
Finally I understand why we are trying to learn these rules, what to do with, what, why, while in fashion magazines you see sometimes something else.
No statement on the fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the designer must have a lot more variants of clothing that those who are photographed.
That is to say that for fashion story which will have a dozen pages (a dozen models) I must be ready to "retailler" at least a fortnight.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements are completely differently than in reality.
We must reckon with it during a creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style are sometimes half the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a great singer but its image and marketing have made a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of the services of stylists remains cautious.
And the familiar faces the sometimes see as unnecessary (it is enough that I know something but what I sound going on in the second grade).
And if someone is making a styling on our part, we must rely on the fact that he dictates with great probability a completely different size (smaller) than he has in reality.
It is then that surfing Google and ensure Boulevard if the news of the celebrity in question, if it has shrunk or grown etc...
Honza and Mario we have asked Sunday on the heart that it is not enough to move in designer fashion and assemble models.
It must communicate with the people he dressed and it is important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing guess people, not flatter, keep his opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort out her wardrobe and fulfil new elements you can't just throw everything and say, My God horror."
"You will find few cases that you find beautiful and conseillerez with what you wear them," said Mario.
He showed us specifically what must contain the so-called "placovka" or the designer bag.
It is the one you cling around the size and that you have on you for everything you need.
Besides things clearly defined as the scissors, rolls to dépilation or to pin the nanny, there is also the nylon thread (the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, hats or special clips), with which it closes a garment in the back, if it is too big (the pin or other type of clip are not usable because they could damage the garment) or a sewing kit.
For that we are not just people who listen but who tried something practical way they taught us how shoes re-soled properly.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could crashing, especially outside.
And so we have stuck, and stuck.
We did not have the right to receive the scissors not to hurt themselves inadvertently.
It therefore really need skills.
Mario made me happy when I was congratulated for my creation.
The competence of which I am a state is not for my girlfriend.
This is only a small summary of what we have learned during the second weekend of course
I began to understand that the styling a profession is not a walk in a garden of roses, that everyone says what he wants.
The need for speed The Run to row across America.
Revision
Originally a race without a problem turning because of a series of errors stupid people who have nothing to do in a routine morning trip to work.
This meets up to a certain extent the ambition of everyone but it achieves nothing if nobody wants to do something more.
The new party under squad - The Run produced great expectations before his exit.
He promised to take a new direction with the series of race Need for Speed already old and out a kind of game from jouables parties that would not only with points.
We were therefore curious how will be the passages added during which the main hero out of his car and done what he wants.
As it is already in the NFS series, the result is completely different than expected.
These are potentially games arcades race but all gets to the bottom because of some unnecessary mistakes that already exist for several years.
It is not really mistakes, but rather the expression of a laziness incomprehensible from developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are caught in the adventure whose main hero Jack has problems characters and to resolve them is to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is the first in New York.
The idea has some interesting points.
The itinerary is divided into ten stages and then in more than 50 races.
This means that each race on another route and stages in different environments which are quite far from each other and are interesting.
The player did not feel that the game he proposes something similar.
Some environments are also cute enough even if the technical level chart is the same type as the previous rounds.
Finally, this is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert in autumn landscapes or in highly snow-covered mountains is very nice visually.
The tests are more from time to time with a atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that you significantly reduced visibility.
Then in the mountains you should pay attention to what an avalanche do not fall over.
In addition to that the different races are well arranged one behind the other.
There is only a small number but it is enough.
There are moments you strive to surpass the number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you will be running against the clock (classic duel with the clock) and then still you expected another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also the police who enters the game and trying to make the difficult situation.
The novelty are the passages out vehicle.
It is rather an interactive animated when most of the time Jack flees to someone and you must help typing on the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there is less moments of this type that what you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is good because this will not hinder and, in the context described above, it - in the elements that dot the game.
The pattern is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that currently there is nothing extraordinary but we cannot say that this is negative.
As regards the realistic simulation you have to look elsewhere.
But while we can find better in the competition the pattern goes very well with the type of design races.
So everything is ok.
The problems begin to emerge after a certain time.
Unlike the pattern, that collisions is not yet at the point.
We do not expect this game a distortion complicated and collisions, but when you have not, in a collision with any object, any idea how has your car, this is not completely right.
During tight overruns sometimes you touch each other slightly but otherwise your car in the mad process.
Or is in tatters.
Thanks to the system... this is not really a problem but it really riles you.
The revival is so that when you're phut or you're out in the context the game brings you back to the time of the last point on the route.
But you do just that 5 redémarrages.
When you used the 5 redémarrages you have to start the game since the beginning.
It is therefore more a tool for the case where something is not happening as it is, something on which you can really count.
Sometimes the redémarrages do not help and it must find a solution recalling from memory the piece itinerary.
The big catch of this game is that the same actions are in the same scene.
For example there are some turns that it must pass a certain way if it does not.
Otherwise you meet on a given location of the vehicles "civilians" always in the same configuration that you have come first, fifth, 5 seconds ahead or one minute late.
What angers the situations when you see the move easily between two oncoming cars and when you arrive, you, you must be set aside and circumvent or curb.
That is equal if you go to the - before him because it is "calculated" so that the situation there always comes close to your nose.
Opponents also have other benefits.
For all the time of the game, you arrive in some places, again regardless of the time, and you always have the same opponent ahead in the same place.
It said the most at the end of the game when you drive on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The adversary must to go before you.
When it happening to you you hiding the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you walk in collision a number of times.
One can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you bored quickly.
And it is a pity because through a model of conduct simple the game is interesting and places with such action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it is equal if it is because the concept of 50 unique routes, the order of the races is such that there is no chance to get bored or something else.
The original idea is the change of car during races.
You must pay attention to the gasoline pumps on the routes because you can change cars, however, most of the time that you enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are ideal for the cities, the American gas-guzzlers for highways straight and the super sports cars in exotic clothes on the very techniques for example on the roads in lacet in the mountains.
And the way of challenges, that are races in particular places that you know of adventure, goes very well with the main diet of history.
You get not only the medals but also experience points to which are added to your profile which is common to the challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, various objects are beginning to unlock:
It connects with the on-line Autolog which among other compares your results with those of other players and provide you other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You have your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it is).
Your speedometer tells you between 150 and 200 km / hour (in principle) and behind you is a subway train that sends you the car directly to scrap.
In the drafting we had a discussion for a few days whether someone has really thought during the creation of this game or if the authors we really take for fools.
The technical part of the game is not alloy, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What makes is that in more extreme situations, imaging is not the level and in some cases tragic way.
This is especially accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imaging you there.
The sound is good and the track is the choice.
In order to please the more and more particularly the young people a new soundtrack was created in the style "I mix everything," but we can expect that no one will buy the stake for music.
Need for Speed general impression: The Run is really confused.
If the game had not these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that he is the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression of not be finished.
The amusement is really well but prepare you to ensure that the mistakes gets you in the eye with the force of a reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
The Czechs are négativistes and Euro-sceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
"I was not expecting a war as hard.".
"This will last 5.6 years before the situation is calm and that all the players are used to their new role," it is Miléna and Vicenova began his presentation at the Faculty of Law the Czech ambassador to the European Union.
When she managed to describe the various EU bodies and their relations so understandable and visible, to the point that a large number of speakers of the Faculty of Law of the University Charles might envy, she showed how she takes her motto "understandable and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Madam Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning echoed the criticism that he is bland, that it is a wrong - - leather, he cannot fulfill any mission and I must say it has cut the breath to everyone because it takes its role to perfection.".
"This is a man who knows listen to 27 Member States, communicate with them and has a clear vision of the direction of Europe.".
She said the new post of High Representative for foreign affairs and defence policy in the framework of an answer to the question: "Who is that the European Union?" "At what phone number must - I call?", as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater clarity of the Union policy address to the states, as is China or India.
Nobody wants to ban our syrecky (cheese cooked to that feels very strong)
Madam Vicenova also reported the agenda that has lived, lives and live in a time close to the European Council.
She called the Czech Presidency of two years ago.
The Czech Republic have solved the financial crisis, rising gas crisis or have organized a summit for a Partnership Oriental.
She called the government's fall very negative and has damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation to the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador Madam, "activity has beaten its full" not only for the Presidency, but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve even now.
It must also approve the new seven-year budget of the Union which becomes very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it seems that the budget will be thin and economies, which branch will be the priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything is solved in the framework of future negotiations.
Madam the recalled its ambassador slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a Europe understandable.".
"I really don't foreign words, abbreviations, jargon that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand that it is true that in Brussels no gherkins or twisted round, bananas differently large or that nobody has forbidden to make syrecky. ".
She wants to make better use of the environment of the EU and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe we expected
According to the Ambassador the Czechs have the reputation of being the Eurosceptics and people who do things that in their negative aspect that positively.
Moreover it is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault is due to several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and weak support of the Czech Republic.
In addition to the Czech Presidency success she then stressed the strength and the cooperation of the Visegrad group.
"Believe me, when I come to the Poles, the Magyar, the Slovak, this French said to me: 'Hey, what are you doing here - low, that is still the Visegrad group?" and he is not happy at all. ".
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future are tough new rules on budgetary policy who expect the member countries.
This is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not at different speeds, rather than a "new European Federation.".
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institute of enhanced cooperation.".
First it was said that cooperation between the countries who want and those who do not wish to remain in their corner. "
"There will be a lot of this type and there will be a Europe at two speeds," really expects Madam Vicenova.
From this point of view it was also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all the themes that have an impact on the EU must be discussed between all members of the EU and not just the members of the eurozone.
History of a mark:
The innovative IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone were to seek the word which expresses the closer the strategy IBM, the closer the "long term".
For a large public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm perceived as very current and however since its creation it has passed 100 years.
The basis of this long-term strategy was thrown by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved if people are willing to consider.
His slogan "PENSE '!" became the footprint around which will develop the life of a giant future (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to edit in 1935).
It was the basis of the culture of the company carefully developed by Watson.
For we thought IBM means a long-term, continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM has survived hundred years thanks to the fact that she was always faithful to its core values and however has not been afraid of change all around it.
This allowed us during our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more, "said the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A system well prepared
Watson, in the 1930s, began to look after its employees as Bata Czech Republic - people of IBM were the only among the first U.S. employees have paid holidays, paid by the employer insurance a uniform of employee elegant and a well developed system of rewards for inventors and commercial.
Similarly IBM has a system of relations with the client well developed.
The company was brilliant early in the discovery of talent - as one of the first companies to have abolished all forms of discrimination and thus could have the choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy because it will be a woman - Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
This works at IBM for 30 years and currently holds the post of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years is what we call jamy, the online brainstorming from what is a lot of future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that it has a lot of ideas - in the firm nearly 500,000 people who work.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that provide him a secure position in the areas of business.
"Since the beginning IBM had a concept rather institution that a technological firm Rosabeth Moss Kanter," said, an economics professor at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve problems of the world of business using its technology," said George Colony of Forrester Research Consulting firm.
As the firm itself there is a difference between entering the market and create this market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue," as it is familiarly in the United States for his slogan - in 100 years it has grown up to become one of the largest global firms.
This is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, housing, services of Council at the level of the server products until nanotechnology.
She owns numerous patents of all U.S. technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among its findings stands for example the distributor of tickets, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the disk.
IBM found itself this year with 220 billion the second largest technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Overview ahead
These are not all the innovations and manufactures who have had the preference of the client and the time - IBM for example failed betting on an operational system own OS / 2, the online Prodige service or IBM computer PCjr:
"From the moment where your business is built on the movement in advance you can't émotionellement stay hooked on the past," noted Samuel J. Palmisano.
For that IBM has no problem to build its bases on a flat - forms and when they do not work it is going.
In the difference by example of Microsoft competitor at the base is and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In the income IBM, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardwares, have a prominent place.
However in 1990 it was with more than half the height representative of hardware.
From the year 2000 IBM has sold assets to poor performance for 15 billion, over that period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of technologies prospects.
She continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it has surpassed the new financial crisis.
IBM is negotiating according to the precepts of his first head Thomas J. Watson, who during the economic crisis has also increased its volume of investment.
It now appears that IBM is the current crisis without interference?
The share price IBM grew from 2008 in rocket 120%, net income of the firm continues to grow.
The logo of the firm IBM is to change all but not its values.
We can expect to this flexible giant control other crises.
IBM history: From the slices of cheese until the flights in the cosmos.
The International Business Machines (IBM) was born in New York 100 years ago; it was originally the name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation complicated.
She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a mark used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the ten year 80 of the ninth century.
They had technologies such as the old "pointeuses,"... which was the arrival and the departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint that until 1930 chaired the Council of Surveillance of society.
Flint dispatched the head of a rival firm Thomas J. Watson to help lead the company.
The leader was then to shadow the founder of the firm - it is on the ideas of Watson that are up to now the identity and culture of the company.
Watson led the firm until 1952.
IBM, as its name, began with the production of all the machines for business and trade - trancheuses cheeses and meat until the cash registers.
During the first four years in which Watson headed, turnover has multiplied up to 9 million and began the expansion of the firm in all parts of the world.
Watson was irreplaceable if the firm after 40 years of leadership is his son who held the director's chair, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s people and computers from IBM helped NASA guide flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight to the moon.
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System / 360.
The PC classic that hastened the computer standard of the time with the name of IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sells its manufactures computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to handle advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that succeeds in IBM these past three years - is the concept Smarter Planet "a smarter planet.".
His goal is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited such as transportation and management of cities.
In the area of trade IBM has developed there was little time a platform "Smarter Commerce" trade, which helps to manage the business cycle.
IBM has a strong history on our territory.
She created its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 then first countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic centre of outsourcing of Brno.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe headquarters in Prague and there is also the research and development team in the world of speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep this donkey, I want more!
Darina Rychtarova (53) said, it is finished!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) becomes bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina hoped that Joseph wakes up its dream of pink and to return home.
Only she could not wait and established clear rules for the future.
"Pepa can return home, but not as my partner," said Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in was Bartosova in his home, she had no idea that the couple would not.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted to move to Ricany, Pepa does not repoussa the singer.
And he confessed in public that he loved.
With time Darina has resigned, has accepted the affair of her husband and eventually tell him goodbye forever.
Rychtirova is not interested to know who her husband layer.
If Rychtar and Bartosova are there will be no wife to host on the door of the house.
"This is the biological father of my son and if he wants to end his life in our common home, nobody will."
"It will not be my old donkey loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," Rychtarova filter showing that it is detached from her husband but they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina has closed the door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect the decision of my wife.".
"I will stay with Iveta and will not change.".
"My wife has put in place a marriage on paper and I respect that.".
"The company continues, I am repairs, the garden, real estate, I buy.".
"With Darina discusses completely normal but we do not together," said couchons Rychtar to Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love it will not prevent it.
"We do not couchons together and it doesn't interest me to know where it goes, with which and if she has an affair.
I know that this is my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta on me and I take full responsibility," said Joseph.
The worst vices women: This applies to you too?
If you ask the men to determine vices typical of women, all, each as others, are able to get out "of their run.".
My dear ladies, you'll know in the following lines of female defects that come to pump blood veins of men.
The purchases
Your half you made remarks that you are dependent on purchases?
Devez you buy at least a garment by week?
You are simply buying and packages at the time of the balances?
In your case we can talk of purchases as a vice.
Some women think that they should restrict their passion to make purchases.
But you say, which could stand - window licking at clothing stores, to look for yourself nice clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colours)?
And although for most women buy a hobby, it can become a real hell for the man.
Remind you just how many times have you told your spouse that he expected the entry...
Insatisfaction constant
"I am not too big?"
"I would need to lose weight at least 5 kilograms - I should start to make the sport?"
"I like you?"
These sentences not remind you something?
Yes?
You are part of these women who are obsessed by their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop look after yourself but a large number of men is allergic to the fact that their partner is still complain of his appearance.
The male does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints increases and more women become empoisonnantes.
The order and cleanliness in the first place
It is like a merry-go-round infinite.
Laver windows, vacuuming, cleaning up the soil, dust, the higher-grade bathroom - and this twice a week.
You made the remarks to your partner that it works with dirty feet on the ground, the children they have tarnished the sink, encrassé the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you suffer precisely this obsession, try to remember that we should not exaggerate and that the order and cleanliness must not be in the first place in the family.
This desire inoffensive cleanliness can spoil your relationship and family peace.
The work of undermines
"Met this spent tracksuit to the dustbin.".
"You accounts put these old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do by land.".
If you do on your partner this undermining this way several times a day, you really break.
It is obvious that you don't think you want everything to be flawless.
Perhaps if the men knew, women would not have to do both of undermining...
The defamation, the persiflage
The defamation, the persiflage but also insults against someone also own some women.
Women are still particularly to relations and are happy to deal with issues like that, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us escape a small persiflage harmless here and there.
Hand on heart that is a feature of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persiflent, even despise and are for their entourage - particularly at work in a collective of women - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their involvement in the Philadelphia victory
The striker hockeyiste Jagr has participated twice to the victory of Philadelphia for Monday's game on the ice of Carolina National and is again in top Czech players productive for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who has made a pass and was named the best player in the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr has also recorded two goals during the game.
Jagr after the match told reporters overseas that he had warned Giroux that this would be a great evening.
"I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick.".
"I felt.".
"Some time this feeling is upon you," said Jagr after its action Giroux marked a goal of the first shooting of the Flyers.
A moment later there was a second assault on the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes' goals for the puck and presented the Maxime Talbot.
A second before the break, the first local player Patrick Dwyer made a downhill, but the beginning of the second part served the Flyers.
Specifically to Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr it marked three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I love to play with him.".
"I don't want to say that it is the best player in the league but it really is part of the top three," said Jagr at its centre.
"I never thought I end playing career with a hockeyiste like him.".
"I'm really happy with that.".
"I want to play him.".
"All these years at the National team players have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," said Jagr.
Caroline was a tragedy of this game because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and new Dwyer on a penalty shot it ends with a difference of one goal.
Matt Read has not ruled out other complications that ended two to one.
"Pronger has done excellent attacks in our area.".
"He banged on the puck, I took the speed and (Read) sailed to the furthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit and I got there," described the last goal of the game of his views Voracek.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defenseman Jaroslav Spacek Montreal has not finished the game with Buffalo it was released in second third because of an injury in the upper body.
The Canadians have not held a experienced defender their lead to two goals and lost after shooting a penalty by 2: 3.
Tomas Plekanec has not changed any of their attacks.
It is the fact that the line back was sick which was particularly bothered the local coach existed rather than lost because they played the game with only five defenders.
"It is nil.".
"We have played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young.".
"But there is nothing to do, it is like that," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement this was not enough and we have not been able to resist.".
"We had just to simplify the game, push the puck out of our area.".
For this we limits, "said P. K. Subban advocates.
Czech defender Ondrej Pavelec, took part in the 30th attack of Winnipeg and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters were involved in the goals of the Jets, who have arrested a series of five matches lost.
How have evolved prices trips since 1989
Until 1989 there was in Czechoslovakia only 5 travel agencies of state: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
The travel agencies offered trips at the time, especially in the countries of the socialist bloc, because the trips to the west were very limited.
The Czech tourists were traveling for the holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel in Yugoslavia and the regime began to have a liking for the western and travel to Yugoslavia were very limited to the Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era, was that he was not authorized for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechs) to travel individually even in the framework of the socialist countries.
In cases where the citizen Tchécoslovaque wanted to travel individually by example in Poland or in the Soviet Union he needed a letter of invitation or travel individual was not authorized.
The travel agencies at that time also provided trips to the West, however, he had to queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after it was not yet won.
The agreement for the currency was the condition to travel to the west was refused to people "politically incorrect" who couldn't travel.
The Czech currency was not however exchanged with others and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the agreement of currencies (Western currency) for travel to the west.
The Czechs were the more often their holidays in the countries where there had therefore many houses and cottages that the Czechs are bought and this habit lasts until now.
The Czechs travel have known since 1989 a great revolution.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were maximum, the Czechs have spent last year abroad 4 million vacation days in the countries of the world.
The great paradox which we have not aware today is that the most popular is Croatia where it was not possible to go free until 1989 as part of Yugoslavia.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s of the last century in neighbouring countries of the west have caused a huge wave of visits short-lived especially in Austria Vienna and Germany.
The Czechs could not long travel by plane to the west that everyone wanted to see at least a moment.
For example, in Paris the travel organisations were sleeping the Czechs in tents in parks because our income does not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a trip of Czechs was winning with his own food, tinned sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech koruna which has enabled our tourists finally after dozens of years to freely buy the currency.
Our level of life as well as the average wage rose which caused around the year 1997 another important moment.
Thanks to a growing demand for travel travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare rounds with air charter service through contracts have tremendously reduced costs compared to what was there before.
In the late 1990s of the last century, the Czechs had links without visas with virtually most developed countries of the world to share the EU who later helped our trips.
Another interesting time in the history of tourism, when post-révolution was prepared the first air charter to a country exotic, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as each year of direct air charter take Czech tourists in the distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
That is more than 100,000 Czechs who visit exotic countries each year.
Once an interesting time in this period which symbolizes our development post-révolution arrived in 2008.
November 17, 2008 the EU have abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to pull completely in the group of developed countries.
In 2008 the Czechs for the first time in history have spent more than half their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time in history have spent more than 15 000 crowns per person for a vacation abroad including charges annexes. crowns per person.
The General Assembly must find its President but this will be completed by a situation without solution "a pat"
Nearly 5mois already the Czech football is without President and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic is not yet known after a General Assembly to be held Thursday at Nymburk.
However there is still no agreement on what to vote to proceed.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to begin to vote for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of the Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure has called on his colleagues has come together and find a strong personality who will lead the football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek football returned back to differences between the chambers of the Association who cannot agree on a common candidate.
This is completely shown on 16 September when he had to choose a new president.
Delegates of the General Assembly gathered unnecessarily in the national House in Prague because the negotiations remained blocked and it has not even been issue to deal with how to elect.
There is no agreement on who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives or the officials also have full powers.
In this single point there was a partial agreement since this moment with the help of the Bureau for the state and the right, according to which the representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
The differences continue always about the regulation for the election.
It is all too clear that the executive committee, which in its planned negotiation or extraordinary, has brought nothing to the situation
The opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times but the underbelly remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed to the third round not to fall into the pat.
"The bone of contention is the following: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," noted one of three vice-presidents of the Association of football of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda which represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the model expected wins in the third round that candidates who received the most votes in percentage within the Board for which he is a candidate.
The Moravia is prepared according to what is said to withdraw that wins the candidate who has received the highest percentage of votes in both chambers.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and this would completely deny the bicameral concept," said Svoboda which includes the objections of the Moravian part and that it would be better not to change the regulation and vote according to the statute in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agreement even if he believes that the regulation of elections set according to the Pelta advantage among all the candidates.
"I want to vote according to the statutes of the association.".
"For that there has not yet insane ideas dreamt up by a representative as during the past General Assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and which in its submissions is defined mostly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him at Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The qualification possible today in a European Championship should calm everyone.".
"Football on a wave of happiness and there will be more spirited for cooperation," the officer of Jablonec who among the three has the most experience leadership of both professional football at regional level.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense.".
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are tendencies to change the regulations to design.".
"This may cause a new blockage to the General Assembly.".
"I hope all good reason will win," said Rajchl.
There is not much time for a common agreement to all parties.
Some meetings should be held directly in Montenegro but who can say if the whole direction of football will be complete for the game.
The flight chartered in which to travel up to Podgorice between Vice other Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not taken off for technical reasons and was seeking a variant to take part of the executive committee on the ground.
In the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister of Education Youth and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the parties torn apart in the sports association the largest of the country and bring them to an agreement.
In the game, there are many: a state funding, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Union Sports who should determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for the position of President because he sees no candidate correct.
If the head of the footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to what he calls for a new President of the Association of football of the Czech Republic (AFRT) it would not be put in campaigning for this high office.
"If there is such a candidate I support it, I fight for him and I do not go to the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," said Paclik to the Czech News Agency (CTK).
The motivation of Paclik is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelta access to the top of the AFRT which in principle would be favourite for this election.
Paclik also points out that in case he would get the elections he would hold the post of President only until 2013 year scheduled for a General Assembly.
He would see in an experienced manager and high level but who is not connected with the world of football.
"I discussed with people who have the profile," he said.
"For me it was terrible when some told me that they did not want to be identified with the Czech football at this time."
"I would like to change this image," he added.
This, said - it bothers, especially Paclik, it is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Union of football of Plzen Roman Berbr, rights to the controversial reputation is known in the scenes as lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of the delegates' the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta occupies the position of President.
"If he wins, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, which is a shopkeeper, it would be even less favourable football," said Paclik.
What angered still is the fact that the name of Pelta has been out there a few years during wiretaps in the investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta escaped without any punishment.
"I don't know what Pelta would bring prestige football."
"And how would be - we considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club Plzen.".
In the case where Paclik would win the vote Thursday, it should prove he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly in September that had ended in a fiasco, think the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first with which I would go.".
"He has big abilities"
"It would be able to stand as head of the representation.".
"But as manager of the Association it would not be able to."
"I am not the nose in what I do not know," said Paclik, who in September has attracted much attention when he called for the annulment of the Commission of the referees with Ludek Macela that has replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says it would be at the level to lead the Association.
It takes as its capacity to lead private firms and that it also runs since last year the club Plzen who celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to make a certain culture.".
"I freinerais the influence of some interested groups who have for example tend to influence the Commission disciplinary and appeal, which leads to situations of bad taste," said Paclik who does not hide his dislike for the leader of the Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It also would consider a harmonisation of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose lobbying power high-level policy would get for the sport more tax money on the games.
"This is one of the key points which the new President should care.".
"If it is the tax on gambling as the state political parties, I understand their argument but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not present his affair with the club Plzen as something negative even if he says that the President of the AFRT should be "at the - above party.".
Pelta is linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla Prague.
"This is not the ideal.".
I see no reason to convey my shares of the club of Plzen to someone if I have to return after a year and a half, "said Paclik.
Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT which should put an end to situations of pat.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association a candidate for the Presidency Miroslav Pelta said that if he is elected, the AFRT will have new statutes should end the disputes in the future on the regulation for the elections.
The official of Jablonec is before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and believe that the success of the representation of football should calm this gué-guerre before the vote.
Pelta before the election of September which has not carried out promised to devote themselves to the national representation and financial resources if he is elected.
It was decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the General Assembly and the delay of two months may allow him to defend his vision of the direction of football, and the present in a broader context.
"People at all levels of football are long and expect Thursday there is a President.".
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the leadership of the Association," he said, but it is primarily associated with the club Jablonec, worked a great number of years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
it is also why he has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately to the General Assembly of June the statutes have been approved that were not perfect as all found out.".
"If there had not all these interpretations we have already had a President since September," said Pelta.
It is precisely the document review the most important of the civic association that has caught the attention of the delegates.
"If I am President, I take that as a personal mission and am ready to take all the responsibilities in cases where it does not work.".
"It is a principle without which we cannot exist," said Pelta.
Then he strives, said - it, not to confront its opponents.
He said earlier that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl he acknowledges in his training in law and he knows that his opponent - candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He has not attacked for long Tonas Paclik that instead of criticising Pelta.
"It is in football for a year and has already had some success."
"His attacks were not the most honourable and has surprised many people during the campaign."
"It is also why some now have doubts about his character," said Pelta to address his opponent but remains, he says, faithful to the statements he made in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football competitions from the lowest level until the national representation.
This should be a showcase of football.
"And I would endeavour to complete all the cases that begin with the Bohémians or the result of the corruption scandal."
"I immediately entering into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all the football," said the Czech news agency CTK reported the deadly candidate two months ago.
He also said that his appointment to the head of football would do no change people.
"I should get acquainted with all employees," he said, where there is an understandable nervousness Strahov since there is no direction.
Although there are catastrophic possible scenarios with the General Assembly, he thinks that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is one point of contention on how to vote in the third round we get to the match.".
"Football needs credibility and it will get that when there will be at its head a new leader," as Pelta says optimistically two days before the day probably decisive for his career official.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT would begin to work hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected President of the Association of football of the Czech Republic to the General Assembly on Thursday that would not please many people.
Rajchl promises, however, that in the case where he would be elected we will begin to work hard.
He wants to systemic changes and make the Executive Committee members are responsible for different areas of football.
He has also promised to settle the case Bohémians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, make football more money and continue the work begun by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President I want to get of football in its entirety.".
"The international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through the national representation, of professional football and a successful football for youth."
"But I am not saying that I will do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
"I'm a team player and want to distribute skills within the Executive Committee so that each member is a specific area."
"And I will hand out difficult missions for football faced a great step forward.".
"Many people will not be happy, because it will begin to work hard rather than criticising others," he added.
He did state, said - it, he would not stand as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"At about me, you know that I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if it is and if I have people behind me that I will constantly sticks in the wheels and issue doubts on each of my actions," explaining why he hesitated.
"Many people have just said that I must not give up because they would also.".
"It is a confidence that I can't betray," he said.
What motivates, said - it is to continue the work started with Hasek.
"Since these last two years there has been a great job and I don't want to let him down.".
"There are processes that have been launched which will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone stopped.," he said with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in a systematic work and it is something that Mirek Pelta does not know.".
"Behind him are people who would of football in such a way that it would be only for those who have been selected.".
"You can blame me a number of things but certainly not to support someone.".
"I am trying to be objective.".
"I want to make football for all, because everybody will be happy not only those who have been chosen
And it confirms again that it would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are some who say the opposite, I am ready to do the maximum to Moravia.".
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and Moravian another whose winners would be in the first division.".
"There would be no situation like now with only three Moravian team in the division because the problem is currently find young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Club of Plzen, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances to win.
"I sense a permanent support of the Czech Chamber who elected me his Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successful," said Rajchl who plans among its future success to save tens of millions of kronor on contracts disadvantageous, contract negotiations with the television and on the law on the games.
He said that the fact that the Association is not united is a fault common to all.
So he said about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose its credibility," he thinks that the second Paclik opponent is a strong candidate who has to offer football.
"Nobody can doubt in Plzen it has done this year a superb job.".
"If elected, he would continue surely in what has been started by Hasek and make no significant change among the people in the Commissions."
"It would not spoil its success," said Rajchl who has assessed his rivals.

A jump in the blue
In Julia Stanek
Pataugeoires ovni, in view of beautiful pools of Budapest: Who trip across Europe can live his miracle blue - and having turned the city or a long walk - may leave rest his legs tired in the bathroom of fizzy water.
A book shows how swimming pool can experience the most well - be.
When Iris Meder would in research trip during the last 18 months, there was a subject which should not miss in his luggage: his swimsuit.
lying on his back in the water, she observed the domes artistically arranged, and swimming against the marbles Putten who expected the other side of the pool and was to admire Art Nouveau meticulously restored these pools converted.
If a covered swimming pool was fun, she noted in her notebook without delay all the details of interest on the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 pools were surveyed this way by the architectural historian Meder and have presented in his book already published: "Badefreuden (Joies of Bain." The Murderer Here! Give municipal pools covered the palace of historical bath in the Black Forest, "concrete buildings in the Taunus Hardcore".
It led his "most outstanding trips to the bathroom of Central Europe" in 13 countries. In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited respectively places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
Germany's 46 years is a real devotee of the culture of the bath.
Meder, says she has not much interest in the sport but it feels attracted to water from a completely different way.
It is galling that fans of swimming are watching blue tiles and accommodate the stench of bleach while the joggers breathe perfume envoûtant forests of spruce, or can listen to the birds trill happy the park.
"I requested a day why the pools must be always so ugly," said the.
"I am starting a collection of beautiful bathroom."
The surface of the water strengthens doubling architecture
A dive in a swimming pool and sauna volatile oils - factor of well - be swimming in the rooms are huge because all are awake, Meder.
And if the builders would have given a little more, the rooms to swim could be a true delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor has a surface water in the rooms."
"She is a transparent side, but reflects on the other hand, however, the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces optically are a twofold: high coffers, multicoloured tiles, Hills.
The volume of image of small format "Badefreuden" is a worthwhile report 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of good - be historic - it certainly want to make a leap in the blue.
The Meder places discovered copies during its remarkable research in Hungary.
Alongside the baths as well - be splendid bathing Széchenyi aged 100 years in Budapest, she found the water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst cave (bloodbath in Miskolc - Tapolca) as well as a bath of baths including the pools are filled with water containing the alcali and Termálfürdö in Városi (Jászberény) and in a building in the shape of a bottle.
However, the outdoor heated pools of Switzerland and Austria offers spectacular views. While a bath roof of Zurich was the whole city its eyes, you can admire the Arlberg lacquerware town from a pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which we can observe the animation on the runway.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool expected swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises three open shelves, while in the back - is the mountains of the Ötztal to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of bleach does not come from all the swimming pools Meder collection.
Many thermal baths from a smell of sulphur, Árpád - spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba from a strong smell of oil, it is difficult to believe, find themselves in a health spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkali water containing hydrogen of carbon that is almost black and its silt you glue to the skin as soon as you let slip in the pool, a spa experience.
During his quest of the beautiful pools, Iris Meder has also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free external pool and outdoor Czechoslovakia, she found herself in a barricaded pitch.
The bath designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was between - time closed.
In casting a glance through the window of the building - Art Nouveau in red, white, yellow, she has seen the development of weeds between the tiles.
She noted a contrary effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: The palace of baths of Bad Wildbad.
This building has already survived three phases; you can discover not only elements néo-romains out since its conception in 1844 but still a room Moorish Alhambra style that was added in 1900.
Since his careful modernisation of 1995, the palace remains the favorite spa bath expert in the pool, Iris Meder - and not just because she is from Schwarzwald.
"It is already a beautiful performance that melt if different construction styles in a unit so great," said Meder.
With such a palace, diving into the pool spa is apparently only a minor issue.

The German bank examines in detail the speculation on the raw
In Christian Teevs
The German bank abandons - her speculation on commodities?
According to information SPIEGEL ONLINE - Josef Ackermann instructed a working group to seek the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the leader of the group is then draw the consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84 percent of Germans find unacceptable that banks are speculating on commodities like corn and wheat.
Two thirds of respondents even require the German bank and other credit institutions discontinuent this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.
It is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the consumer group Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid October.
The author Harald Schumann said in this article that speculation on the commodity markets, pushing global prices and that banks share a complicity to global hunger.
The campaign of consumer protection is specifically against the head of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, - even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act the same way.
The speculation on commodities was originally introduced to protect merchants against price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts share between - time that bettors have posted offers and demand - and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann was responding to criticism differently US competitors: He promised to investigate the accusations and said, "no matter is worth put at stake the reputation of Deutsche Bank.".
According to information SPIEGEL ONLINE an international working group is currently examining the charges of Foodwatch - Report.
The review should be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the board of Deutsche Bank must be submitted - with recommendation, usual.
In January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences.
It could result in a reduction of the commodities market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann built its Image
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode has welcomed the news, but at the same time, confirmed its criticism of the financial sector: "The speculation on rising food prices shows a draconian way, how the banks today are harmful to the general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be today especially under obligation.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments in its portfolio, for which the money was invested on food speculation," said Bode.
"It matters little, for Mr Ackermann, if it is a question of starving people or if the reputation of the Deutsche Bank is at stake."
The awareness of Ackermann may seem at first sight surprising, but it is clear that the chief executive of the group wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving office.
The Deutsche Bank did announce Monday that the president of the Council of Administration will not change what is planned in the Council of Administration.
He could improve his image with an abandonment of agricultural speculation.
And about potential losses, it did little to concern - his successor will be.
A on two would terminate the investments in commodities.
Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
So far more than 30,000 people have already participated in the campaign organization.
Bode released the survey Tuesday, with which the 7 and 8 November the Forsa Institute has completed questionnaires from 1001 people.
Just 11 percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank proposes investments for which bets on the price of food products are made.
Many customers of the bank would also personal consequences if they knew that their bank is involved in such operations: one in two would terminate, following the poll, all the investments for which money is injected in speculation on commodities.
43 percent déconseilleraient of such a bank to their entourage, 49 percent said they think the termination of their account to change to bank. "
21st home in Vienna
The Pavilion who moved
On the Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups, downs and a Happy End: the Austrian flag for global exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 has won awards, has been a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruins.
Now it is again open and takes the place of house of exposure.
If there is enthusiasm for an architecture after - modern war, for his clear forms, its hangars in glass, and her bold and its new building materials that are typical of the belief to technical progress, then the flag of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Expo is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion received once the "Grand Prize of Architecture" for its construction, steel and glass and suspended.
The construction is seen up to our days as an important step in contemporary architecture.
He has made the architects so famous, he has also built the Pavilion for Expo next Austrian.
With his legendary home to four cylinders of BMW and its adjacent construction in the form of bowl in Munich, he finally became famous at international level in 1973.
His draft flag as a temporary construction had been exposed after the exhibition in the Garden Switzerland to the station south of Vienna, has been transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was not physically or technically suitable for a museum - not walls to hang the works of art, not a good environment.
However, it was also long used, "so that contemporary art gets a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building was empty and is increasingly dilapidated.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name of "House of the 21st century" and will be in future used as museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday night the Belvedere museum opened, which owns the house, the first exhibition - a chance at any point of view.
The new departure was led by Agnes Husslein - Arco, which became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere.
Husslein - Arco, has promoted an art historian to a considerable career in his youth, artistic skater in Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the museum of modern art of Salzburg, it led to the conversion work with politicians and the protection of monuments, it received public funds and private sponsorship and established the operation.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exposed, a cafe and a bookstore there, and an office must be built.
Surveillance strict, small budget
For the implementation Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded with sensitivity secession of Joseph Olbracht and that he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the flag was "extremely important" a place where he had seen "virtually every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness following his trip to Vienna and by his change of use.
At the current changes, there were big problems: the building was "a chasm in energy," said Krischanitz.
The profiles of the facades in glass windows were changed, insulating glass fibre reinforced glass was asked and the roof replaced by a particular safety glass.
The beams thermal bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and coatings filled with asbestos have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a sign of light tamisé between home and road ensures lighting, a bridge leading to the entry - it is almost a new construction, but still the Schwanzer Pavilion.
The exterior doors of origins remained, the house is painted in a shade protection against rust red, brown.
And the cinema is identical to what it once was.
And all under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and inexpensive were to be found, and that appeal to the Office of the protection of monuments," said Krischanitz and it draws attention to a gross floor in basement.
Despite all the constraints, the problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
That would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a story typical of "Drop - in - the - City.".
Such architecture is "still in the wrong place" and wants to "awaken the good conscience.".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because there is a chance of urban construction: around the Garden Switzerland is precisely the "area of the station" newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another stroke of luck may happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the construction of another Krischanitz places, because the Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin-based temporary art center, and as he said, it is already negotiating with the city to get a site in the vicinity of the Garden Switzerland.
Bahn plans a winter crisis in million package.
The railway company has developed a plan - crisis, which aims to prevent the train accidents in winter.
The number of employees will double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against the train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company Deutsche Bahn "will spend more than 70 million this year.
The daily Bild Zeitung, reported earlier, citing a plan - internal crisis in the group, that investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be provided until 2015.
This should allow greater availability of vehicles and of the rail network in the case of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for snow removal of rail facilities and docks should between other double and move to 16,000 people.
The goal is to rid the docks of snow and ice until the beginning of the phase of service and 90 percent of the devices necessary path in the service in a period of four to five hours.
Two months ago the Chief station Ruediger Grube warned the government and the industry at a conference at the summit of train accidents also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company has been a lot of problems for the transport of users "because it lacks between other reserves in case of difficult weather conditions.
That is how many new regional trains for years an authorisation from the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there was a delay in the delivery of trains.
The company of railway has for years of what to do, given that it must check the axles of trains ICE significantly more often in the workshop, after a break of axles took place on a ICE in the central train station in Cologne.
The German bank Deutsche Bank "pays millions of penalties in the US.
After the case of Josef Ackermann there is new to the USA: German bank Deutsche Bank "must pay a fine to the tune of millions.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already enough, the past catches up this giant of the sector in the US: the Institute of Frankfurt pays compared 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle a dispute because of the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is the sale of mortgage documents.
The financial market regulator NCUA door to big banks a series of charges, and to encourage cooperative banks to make false promises on the purchase of financial products; they would have played down the risks.
These documents have lost considerable value during the financial crisis and have led to the banks to the bottom.
"We are pleased to be able to find a solution to this issue, without the parties initiate a procedure in court," said a partner of Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank has recognised in comparison no fault.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which is committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
The president of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible cooperative banks of the US and it comes in case of bankruptcy, in order to protect the deposits of customers.
The NCUA is trying to repair the damage incurred billions of dollars.
The comparisons concluded now are the first of their kind.
The regulator has also taken other major banks in part and he has been assigned to the Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As regards the issue of mortgage documents he is "Mortgage - backed Securities.".
The homes of credit are at the base.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, which was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even if the events are already a few years, at the moment it blows on US banks a wind storm.
Investors and the supervisory authorities have filed numerous appeals to obtain compensation or to punish breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of complaints.
It accuses 18 major international banks, the two real estate financial state of US Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to be advantaged "in nature in cases of mortgages of about 200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank must also file an appeal with the FHFA, it is several operations to a total of 14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities asking that the Frankfurter meets the "substantial losses", but without mentioning a specific sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the applications as unjustified and says to defend themselves.
WARREN Buffett increases of 10 billion IBM
Buffett, the guru of finance, invests huge sums into the company IBM IT.
Since March, he bought shares worth more than 10 billion.
Until - the big US investor Warren Buffett says constantly not investing in IT computer companies, given that the "long-term evolution of companies do not suggest that bad outcomes.
It has, however, read the reports of IBM and changed its opinion on the investment in this sector.
He had already understand much earlier that IBM proposes especially services and computer systems to IT sectors of other companies.
An investment of Warren Buffett is considered an attack knighthood in the world of finance.
Therefore the IBM IT gives itself the right to appeal to "Mr IBM.".
For Buffett revealed today to the economic programme "CNBC, he bought since March of IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway has become a big shareholder of IBM with 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM has never knew nothing of this commitment.
He praised the leadership, which even during the economic crisis had assured of reasonable profits.
"You have done a great job," said Buffett strategically.
IBM set for some time on the lucrative services IT as "exploitation of accounting centres.
The pioneer of the computer, more than 100 years, offers both Software and consultation that calculators very efficient business.
Buffett had until now refrained technology companies.
He said he invests only in businesses he understands business.
But the contrary Buffett tackles rather rail freight, manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 subsidiaries and shares with a whole series of large groups such as Coca Cola - or Munich Re, the ex Rück.
The 80-year-old of 81 in the 1960s "the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and had erected in one of the most prestigious global companies, thanks to smart investments.
However his lifestyle is modest.
That is why it is a cult figure for many investors the world over.
His almost unerring sense to earn money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha.".
After the announcement of Buffett's investment IBM shares rose one percent to the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", such as as IBM, also has a stock market value of a total of more than 220 billion and account with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
For Microsoft, said Buffett, it does not participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer" of the Turkish media are skeptical of the state of German law.
A newspaper even talk of a "bloody ideology," which return far.
The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had a context.
Following this new, Turkey and the German-Turkish population reacts with fear and concern.
Because for many germano-turcs the spectrum believed long dead reared its head: since the incendiary attacks of Mölln in November 1992 and at Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable with this context right-wing extremist against the Turks.
Whether there is a xenophobia in Germany, there has never been question.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals the proportions which is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to the bloody ideology," "That was the title of the publication on the Internet in the Turkish newspaper Haberturk." "
The newspaper Sabah "underlines that one of the authors would have been a v - man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the quagmire of extreme - right.
It is a reasoned that reacted the Turkish community in Germany: she called this weekend to a silent commemoration for victims of racial violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had thought in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the germano-turc recruitment.
It is with the gaies colours that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a history of success.
The reports of some Turkish media are a slap: "the gift of Germany for the 50th anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform, "Haber X," which refers to the context of the series of murders.
So the publication of German "Hurriyet" has no compunction to draw clear conditions.
"it starts to stink," is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He points out that people have been murdered, would have paid taxes and have given by their work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
The police action was seen very critically on the germano-turcs forums and those - they had subsequently debated the success of their research.
 Why it is not already come much earlier in the spirit of the German authorities to search suspects in some circles of far-right, asking the authors.
More than a is ready at least rhetorical means drastic even: "If the case continues to be, it will be to migrants anything other than self-defence and weapons.".
"it will be the best self-defense.".
"The inner peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of the information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," wrote "Selen.".
What this means if domestic peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have explained.
The photo of the ruins after the fire in Solingen is deeply rooted in Turkish and German memory.
Because no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a real threat, and the Germans, on what the mistrust and distance by acts of violence could lead.
The attacks have sharpened the sense of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
Once it is above all the failure of German policy after the attacks which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Chief of the Turkish state, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time, in his speech, how taxes produced the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of its tax burden.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how the distrust of many Germano-turcs is deep in the state of local law since that date.
In addition to the efforts of a further clarification and reassessment of terrorism of extreme - right in Germany, a clear message is this time - if necessary.
The bank scandal of Lake Zurich
The Bank the most adventurous of Europe is not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has done almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and patina between - time from one crisis to another.
It is a German who must lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber's "was imagined.
After his dramatic departure of the head of the Bundesbank; it was informed in July that it would post in 2013 an almost as dramatic: President of the Council of Administration of the big Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards a career unexpected and lucrative.
Axel Weber has said publicly praised; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its strength recently obtained and was kind of comments on the future colleagues.
"The UBS managed the Turnaround.".
"I welcome the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.".
And yet, as early as September it was clear that everything would change.
A securities dealer UBS in London had diverted all the security systems of the Bank and had soared about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a banker well known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
President of the board of directors of UBS is seen since as suffering - and all are asking: When Axel Weber finally amount?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised of the bank from February 2012.
And it will resume the presidency of administration already in May - not in 2013, as the bank statement Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it becomes difficult.
It is not a banker, a professor of economy and President of the bank, and he was certainly need a period of adjustment.
Suddenly he assumed responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which comes to prove yet again that she has long deserved the title of "the biggest bank scandal of Europe.".
Indeed, UBS is a huge side - until recently, it was the biggest asset manager of the world, and the other, it is faltering for years of a scandal.
Nothing, it seems, the Swiss bank savings so proud.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager of strong, silent and cunning, but also, she had combined with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become, in the field of investment banking, a very large bank.
So the UBS managed to one side in 2007 with 1.6 billion more money from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she had advanced as investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made sense.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later a professor of bank for long years in Zurich said: "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good bank before my students."
"In the current context, one wonders: how I could simply be wrong at this point?"
It is profoundly wrong.
In 2007 it emerged that for the first time something was amiss at UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew surprisingly, which was regarded until - there as a senior and a brilliant intellectual banker.
A few months later was tipped for what reasons he was party.
The division of the bank had soared with Only documents and has done a cross on billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of $13 billion francs and made a cross.
For this she did find investors, but who, shortly before, have a role player furrowed her brow: Asian state not - transparent from Singapore and an Arab state, which was passed over in silence, to the point that there has never learned his name.
"This was the first time.
In April 2008 has worsened.
The bank was to announce fresh losses running into billions, the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second board the better paid to Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was given its investment mistakes in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought at UBS tens of billions of securities issues, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for convertible bonds, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
Any Switzerland has been rocked - because she noted how it can be dramatic for a small country, harboring if big banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of the UBS 2007's "raised more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We have not been able to save the UBS again," said the researcher of banks, Geiger.
After the first disaster in the second.
Already a few months before, UBS had surrendered because of a tax dispute with America and is ready to publish the data of the wealthy clientele, who had defrauded the IRS perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of 780 million - in repayment of unjustified profits from these operations with a fine together.
Thus the UBS has more or less published that she had helped to tax fraud.
At the same time she lost something that has always been its capital in competition with the rich clients: the prestige of the discretion.
After the scandal Swiss banking secrecy has not been the same.
It was followed by the withdrawal of the head of the board and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of clients' money.
Thus the bank had lost in a few months its credibility in both sectors of business: investment banking because of bad speculation and asset management because of tax fraud.
And, as there was somewhat of a return to calm, and as we thought, that UBS would do, he followed this unfortunate history of merchants of title: one merchant rocketing title 1.7 billion euros before the bank realization that something was amiss.
And it publishes: with risk management in the investment bank that still does not seem to work.
"With the case Adoboli, risk control to too little changed," said Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is safe: "the problem of UBS is that it has no control of the risks."
However it was exactly the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long taken their function to become guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but safety for money - and the world could well collapse in the - beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of an unshakeable reliability as Lindt & amp; Spruengli chocolate are for a particularly noble.
The central UBS in Zurich will still hand in hand with the strong cliché of the private Swiss bank - it is only a little more.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank has its headquarters in the central train station of Zurich, which led directly to the central train station in Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-capped mountains of Switzerland.
The buildings here are prestigious, rents stores are among the highest in Europe.
The bijoutiers as Tiffany's, it is here between stores Swiss traditions like confectionery amp; Spruengli.
For centuries of Swiss bankers have resided here: the national bank through the palace of Credit Suisse until private banks elitist as Julius Bär.
It arrives in the lobby of the UBS by a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are clad in stone, before are thick leather chairs, and the logo of the bank, a major label for "safe.".
The UBS knows what the client research here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has a day off the market - or betrayed the two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, finally as all Swiss bankers it does business with the two big banks.
The UBS would become too large, it is - - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons are also common.
The Swiss there would have nothing more to say.
"And even when they have long adapted to the mores of the Anglo-Saxons."
This has been the Anglo-Saxon investment bank UBS, which has changed, it has made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the jungle of sub-prime mortgage loans as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"This Wednesday the coalition government of the small country of seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," wrote author Lukas Hässig in his book "The crash of the UBS.".
With up to 68 billion francs about 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the bankrupt the big bank.
How could this happen?
If we speak with Swiss bankers, they see the problem, especially to the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks have found a huge group.
A bank has been created, which was already too big for the small Swiss - and constantly recorded an increase.
What has helped is that the two banks prédécesseuses different from UBS were completed: a bank rich, but lethargy with strong asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but already more internationalized.
Suddenly, the international investment banks have been favourably access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of Group UBS, and Marcel Ospel, formerly chairman of the board of directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel constituted a dream team," said the researcher of banks, Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great intellectual modest, which are very well models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who made his way up to the summit with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have relied until "at the end to Wuffli.
And Wuffli would probably have committed to the end a decisive error: "He thought that its models were the reality," said Geiger.
"This is a tragic fall."
Disastrous, perhaps.
One thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall.
The staff of the UBS remembers clearly rallies leaders during which the head of the group Wuffli gave always the same: to dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The US bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She has ordered the "League Tables" the rankings, which have documented at this time the success of the banks.
After all the UBS wanted to climb to the top.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In case of currency and transactions in securities it has played a very important role.
The business advisors, who had the responsibility, have pointed out, however, a weakness: in the international operations of interests, in the jargon "Fixed Income," there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
The UBS would have shortcomings in the US mortgage products.
To fill this gap, UBS has launched in an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
Assoiffés growth, it is also the bank itself that a management created before it in the US sub-prime mortgage loans investments that have invested.
She has turned into a massive machine that has packaged and put the documents of value based on US mortgages - but which has also retained risks.
Even when other banks were looking for a long time.
"Even in the summer of 2007, while the US housing market was in flames, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, the banking expert.
More euphoria is much more the fall is brutal.
A manager after another has had to leave, when put an end to attempts proved more difficult than we thought.
Positions at UBS became ejection and so far are bancaux.
Anyone who heads the big bank has an almost impossible task.
It must find a strategy for a bank, to which all business models suggested disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger has already an idea: an end to the investment bank, concentration in the management of assets, return to the Swiss roots.
But the bank does not (yet) go so far.
But the investment bank must atrophying vigorously, as it is clear until now. "

The smart crows spread in cities
In many places, freux are considered "problem of birds." But experts say that these highly intelligent animals are no longer hunt cities for a long time.
Some, like the others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. The crows belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities, residents' complaints are increasing because of the dirt and noise of animals.
A antidote against "No problem of birds" is not yet in sight.
In the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts have said that this is no longer possible to drive the freux cities.
Experts from across Germany deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
The protectors of nature based the problems of cities on the exodus of freux particularly protected: The use of chemicals in agriculture to destroy more of the traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, development and the slaughter of nesting trees typical made life difficult for birds.
The crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large settlements with more than 600 nesting couples in the westfälischen Soest, in the north west - including Jever, and Achim Diepholz near Bremen and in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had earned negative ads because of the massacre of crows in this region.
Critics have found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with clubs particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the exclusion serves to nothing," said the planner of the city and the landscape of Leer, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests using the water under pressure or cut down trees, often produces undesirable consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr.
"The animals moving away, large colonies split up and they disperse in other places."
"The elimination is conceivable that in exceptional cases such as hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We are forced to live with them, we cannot be exterminated."
The problem is not solved in the cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Concevable is a combination of the ousting of animals to a aversif conditioning and tempting offers to help resettle elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Maria Jürgens Uta prospectait "signs info in place of chainsaws" to establish relations with completely different: "We can finally better bear a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger - road - educational dimensions of the Schleswig Holstein -, road signs advising on the lives of these freux very intelligent.
This project was between - time adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the critical of the noise caused by birds: "This is a large number of communication, these birds - there have much to say.".
The intelligence and the ability of animals are legendary: The freux are not only work instruments to achieve a treat but they make their own tools as instruments of work.
The éthologistes of Cambridge University tested four freux recently, at what point is the intelligence of the birds.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to do down scaffolding with stones in order to achieve a larva.
Without much training, they recognized that a déterminément stone should have some size and form to collapse the platform.
In a second trial, the astute crows then had to solve a problem more compact.
In a cylinder placed vertically, researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their spoils with their spat.
However, the researchers had set pieces of wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with which they fished the small bucket of small pipe.
Three of the four freux manage even from the start.

The mass slaughter staff
The new book by Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. Titled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (Beauty and the Sorrow: an intimate history of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters who you greenhouse the heart.
A council to start: déchirez carefully this page and into your marque-page.
You will learn to know these people in detail. In this storybook tale of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon in these few moments where, as one of its men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the fog of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish journalist and historian.
It is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for literature.
He wrote a book out of the ordinary that he described, accurately, as "a book of anti-histoire."
It contains a few names, treaties important or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion on the strategies and equipment.
This is not a book about what happened, he said, "a book describing what it could look like.". It is the "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"The beauty and grief" summarizes the experiences in time of war 20 men and women more or less ordinary, the two sides of the war, young schoolgirls and botanists to escaladeurs, passing by doctors, paramedics and sellers.
Some will become heroes.
Other prisoners of war. Some will lose members, will become mad or lose life.
Their lives are vacillating here as a church candles: while some extinguishing rightwinger, new.
The book by Peter Englund departs from the history books.
It has the idea that the First World War is that by the terrible war trenches on the Western Front.
"The beauty and grief" described deftly other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are under hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tse-tse flies boisterous are a problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people as a natural disaster, such a hurricane Katrina which stinks the cordite still hanging.
When cannon shots echoed in the distance, and you're a stay-at-home mom, are you staying or fuyez-vous?
Who will come anyway?
Almost nobody can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts was expanded by assumptions, expectations, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and grief" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nanny within the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a sailor of the German fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are more preserved through the accumulation of small moments and details.
Most address the deprivation and the ability to get by.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, ersatz everywhere."
"Café, fake imitation of aluminum, rubber, paper, bandages wooden buttons."
He continued on the replacement food in Germany.
He described the "meat made of crushed rice cooked in fat mutton (and over with a false bone of wood); tobacco manufactured with roots dry and the dried skin of potatoes; wooden soles of shoes."
He says that "837 permitted substitute meats are recorded in the production of sausages. It also find 511 cafes."
Some stories deal with honour and courage.
An American acknowledges its own impulse to the savagery and says about the war: "You feel that, after all, is what the men were intended, rather than sit in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than pretending that such a veneer is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbaric behind your shirt empesée and cloutée.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes he may die, and that nobody will notice or pay attention.
"When is resigned to sacrifice, we hope to have an audience," he wrote.
It is unfortunately rather comparable to "a man strangled in secret.".
Other comments relate to the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict becomes more of a history of economic competition," said Peter Englund, "a war between the factories.".
It captures the arrival of what he called "a new species within the aviary at the beginning of the century: the mass murderer well-balanced and convinced ideologically, clothes well tailored, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly behaviour; there is so much that heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who tried to catch a vénérienne disease among prostitutes in order to avoid the service at the front.
"It is the most grotesque in the trade of more due to gonorrhea, that the soldiers" buy and cover the genitalia in the hope of finishing in the hospital, "he wrote.
"The more desperate to apply on the eyes, which translates into a blindness to life."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves prose, Peter Englund is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to its task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, it captures how the war has "triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion."
People are beginning to ask why their leaders are a war.
The best books on the First World War are often indirect, as "Great War and Modern Memory" (The Great War and Modern Memory) Paul Fussel, or "In the west nothing new," Erich Maria Note, rather than complete.
The book by Peter Englund is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming that I have read in a non-fictionnelle.
I do not reveal.
But it is as if it had come out of his book, seized your hands this page where the list of people and burned with a match.
After a first false, a carefully planned operation

Mr Kelly said that many people would and came in the park during the day, in the manner of migrants. An hour of the morning was therefore a schedule.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park was the least of people," he said.
The emergency services vehicles equipped with commercials and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, to intervene.
The lights and loudspeakers resounding recorded messages appeared to intimidate protesters.
While the Community affairs officers entered the park equipped their clear blue jackets, many protesters have simply gathered their business and are parties.
No attempt has been hit before 1h45 said the Police, which left the occupants to gather their business.
Other teams of police were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if the arrests were necessary.
Journalists present inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the Police Department, said that the measure had been taken solely by security.
But after many journalists, the Police would have prevented the speech inside the park, seriously held by officers.
Mr Browne said that trucks of television cameras present on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the Police was moving west through the dense thicket of cases of demonstrators, including luggage, the grass in sheets and plastic bags filled with clothes, teams of the Department of Sanitation followed, cleaning all the occupants left behind.
The few demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the centre of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the Police has moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicentre of the camp clung together.
Finally, two people were chained to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
The emergency services were called to cut the lock.
No arrests took place in the park before 0330 Kelly said.
According to the Police, the cleanup operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
most for "disturbing public order and rebellion.".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most senior officer to be found on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the Department detectives, was also present.
Mr Kelly, although now, "did not operations" Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police officers filled along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of intervention needed.
The barricades were put on Cortlandt Street, one block north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, south.
It was the Police extend well beyond the perimeter of the park Zuccotti.
Several officers, most equipped with shields, have even been seen push people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most serious of the night took place south of the park.
At around 5.00, south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the overturned a police car. Others have been sighted in the process of clearing the tires of a truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood has arisen in the wheel of the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a protester were hospitalized.
The union of school aid is suing the city for redundancies
The union that represents hundreds of school aid who lost their jobs last month plans to bring a trial in the city for layoffs unnecessary and discriminatory. The impact is disproportionate on schools serving disadvantaged pupils.
The lawsuits are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, the Council of the 37th District, to try to overturn the dismissals.
Six hundred seventy-two school aid, coordinators of parents and other employees, part of the less well paid, City have lost their jobs on October 7. The union leaders have compared these redundancies to a political revenge for not having left the city access to a fund for health care led by groups of workers, and that would have helped close the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities have denied the charge.
At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council responded, mentioning that layoffs of school aid n "were not specified in the budget.
The officers of the Council of the 37th District said they meet a notice of claim, warning the education department that he would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce the lawsuits in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Dennis M. Walcott and the Department of the education of the city will be the defendant. The complainants will be represented by eight workers made redundant, all black or Latin American origin, as most school aid that have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman of the legal department of the city, said that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons of the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints received by the New York Times, the union backing the number of redundancies in schools in the most deprived areas of the city to support his complaint against unfair treatment, saying that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to underfunding.
While there are no dismissal on Staten Island, and some barely in Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aid have lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts neighborhoods south of the Bronx.
Noting the loss of five school aid on eight employed at Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the prosecution say "This is not a neighborhood of well-off parents who can get funds to fill the gap."
The budget of the "public school 36 has been reduced by 3.26 percent this year. Funds have also been lost when the city has changed its calculation of the entry of additional funding for each pupil."
The union also says that the directors of schools have been misled by some terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of coordinators of parents.
The memo employed the term "overshooting" to describe the action, even if "excess" described more generally the action of moving a teacher of a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the project of complaints, "66 parent coordinators were laid off," and "not only for cause."
Mission completed: Congress to find agreement on the issue of Libya
It would appear that Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement on Capitol Hill on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It took an uprising succeeded, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as U.S. involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Sens. John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut), clapping the Libyan people for their revolt and American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is to honour the courage of the Libyans when they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"This is a bipartisan support to their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless but the debate on Libya has never been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers of both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the wording of several resolutions to approve or not the U.S. military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain have presented a resolution to authorize the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and has never been the subject of a vote in the Senate.
But the same day of the failure of the bill, the House of Deputies also rejected a measure to reduce the funding of U.S. operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission is therefore remained under a form of purgatory legislature - the Congress sufficiently upset to criticise the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough for him out of the sails.
The indecisiveness of Congress has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed last October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "congratulate the Libyan people for his extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "congratulate the men and women of the U.S. armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their courage and great professionalism."
The resolution also says "the national interest of the United States to reach a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
The EU 's new measure all the support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or divisera-t-elle lawmakers like last June?
Sen. and Chairman of the Board Richard D. Lugar (Independent) objected to the latest version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of new project.
In the Capitol, the House must vote this week an amendment to the Constitution to achieve a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all congressional Republicans and some Democrats.
The measure, supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other issue, to get a floor vote in the House or the Senate.
Other lawmakers have so far failed to approve their amendments, but it is not without trying.
The amendment is part of the 68 Goodlatte constitutional amendments have been introduced in Congress on a broad range of topics.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations of a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful who "would control federal spending.".
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - including the new Republicans who want to gild their CV - the chance to boast of being "author" of such a measure.
The law on the control of the budget (Budget Control Act) approved last August asked the vote of the House and Senate on the amendment to a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of warrants during which members of Congress can serve, while Jose E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the limit of two terms for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) has proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to a quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is proposed, like the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if two-thirds of the states are opposed.
So eager were the members to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers have proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The pace slows in the early 1990s, when the members were generally more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they have today.
The last amendment to have been added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacrée but not beaten" says Gabrielle Giffords during his first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman was shot at point-blank range in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) emerged Monday night in a television broadcast, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow Broadway" and said he would before any recover rather than return to Congress.
During his appearance at the newspaper "20 / 20" on ABC, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords has struggled for form phrases and needed help to walk.
"The show has touched his return difficult following the ball that fractured her skull and pierced the left side of the brain, through the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprise return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and wounded 13 others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called his recovery "difficult.".
After Diane Sawyer asked how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, replied "rather well.".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a one-hour special edition of "20 / 20," broadcast on the eve of the release of the couple's new book entitled "Gabby": a story of courage and hope. "
The "special issue has traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first weeks, we see on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a large scar on the front.
It is to use one or two fingers only, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair while doctors learn to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "Be.".
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of his breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: we see Representative singing with doctors air Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin '?".
In the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours each day with doctors, said she did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, it was him read an article on the shooting of 12 March when she was stopped and asked for the first time information on the six people killed in the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a prison in Missouri and vigorously Treaty pending the trial.
"There was a lot of people," said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
During his recovery, said Mark Kelly to Diane Sawyer, she said "I was beaten."
"So I would say, 'Gabby", you have not been beaten, "said Mark Kelly.
You have just been massacred.
And turns out, to restore and come back stronger than ever.
More pity that respect for the troops.
The event: a gala at Wall Street to reap millions of dollars for homeless veterans of New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ride on the powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The Supporters crowd is standing on its feet cheering for the.
"The men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the collection of funds in the spring.
A military haut-gradé, attended the gala also Adm. Mike Mullen, chief of staff of the United States, has seen the role of troops in a different way.
"They have been presented as a kind of orphan," haut-gradé wrote in an e-mail.
I am sure that the organisers had good intentions.
I know.
But this was not the respect. Just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have installed between the military and an American public passionate but often distant.
There are lavished praise the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some military.
The public is increasingly as if he was sorry for the men and women in uniform.
"We are not at all," said Brig. Gen. Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will leave soon for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to support us to lock ourselves in the role of spirits unlucky."
It is a very sensitive subject for the military leaders, who do not want to seem not grateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of revenantes troops of the Vietnam War was much worse.
Thus, most conversations on the mercy in confidence among the veterans.
After the return of his two sons of combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some people would watch with respect because they were facing insurgents and have traveled to distant lands.
Others will ask if "a veteran angry and violent hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the Government to Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who were the subtle way talks asked if he would be able to cope under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return.
"When you raise the subject of the service, you are facing negative impressions," said Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his son.
The military difficulties arise, in part, from the American indifference to the wars.
The victories are rarely congratulated by a country as unfamiliar with the military and which sees little direct benefits of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we value more heroism in the same way as the Second World War," said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people focus largely on the depth of the suffering of the military.
The troops are recognized for the number of periods of services endured, the number of friends lost or the extent of the injuries.
The army face growing pressure to crack down on rapists
This week, a hearing will decide whether capital 28 men and women will go on trial against the army for alleged inaction on rape.
The case, hundreds of plaintiffs prepare the next.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was aged 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She was returning to his barracks in Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a six-pack of beer.
He asked if he could join in his bedroom for a drink.
"C" was a wake-up call, "said Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texane has set aside his concern.
I thought: no, it has 19 years.
"It is the Texas," she said.
"I will have to follow my intuition."
A few minutes after entering the bedroom Elizabeth Lyman, the man was grabbed from behind, thrown by land and raped, claims.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still in service and not others, will wait with anxiety the court decision during a historic trial which will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether a trial against the former defence secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of not having stopped the widespread rape within the military, thus going against the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Ranked in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, the trial involved the departure 17 plaintiffs. That number rose to 28 months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army has not investigated, prosecuted or provided adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says in galonnées military, because the problem starts by them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she said.
"Who are the individuals in a position to" eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leaders. "
The lawyer also said that since February, she was contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of which could be part of future lawsuits.
His strategy: instead bring all the plaintiffs in this case - putting all its eggs in one basket - it will start several trial, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defence team, for the Defense Department, led by the US attorney Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the strategy of defence, and essentially the fact that the military cannot be pursued by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries suffered by staff in active service.
"The alleged evil is inherent to military service of the complainants" indicate the documents.
The Defense Department declined to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women have still not, officially, the right to go into combat, this distinction is listed on paper: the front lines of the recent wars are only rarely.
In Iraq as in Afghanistan, teams of soldiers women play an increasingly important role, particularly in contact with the local women.
Result: on these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two-thirds in combat situations.
It is time for the army to modernise says Susan Burke.
It is not only to fight: three other trials are underway in more of its own.
At the Yale law school, the center of legal services for veterans is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly encouraging an atmosphere misogynistic.
On the other hand, the nonprofit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the army, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorders" awarded to victims of rape to give them leave - a relatively ordinary, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network (network of military action), a group for human rights.
His group has filed a lawsuit in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the handling of applications for benefits for people who have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine bills independent of each other have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, offering various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded after the centre of intervention and prevention of sexual assault (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) of the Department of Defence.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, after the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5 percent of the 19,000 incidents this year.
The report appeared in March is also studying the percentage of lawsuits: in 2010, 20 percent of cases in the military have been the subject of a trial - half the percentage of the civilian judicial system.
The plaintiffs in the case of Susan Burke describe their aggression as the first of a series of injuries.
In the case of Lyman, it informs the Military Police of rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she says, asked to tell 11 times in detail his rape at different police, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her attacker - due to a cut to his arm - was found in his bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is sitting before a judge, a trial in which we asked about his sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier the day of the attack.
Six people testified as character witnesses for the perpetrator of the crime, which was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day when the verdict was delivered," said Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I am crying after the court."
"I have been placed in psychiatric unit, and when I'm out, I remember saying to my commander" This was not his trial but mine. "."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to see a military psychiatrist, who finished by diagnose a personality disorder, making it unfit for service.
In January 2010, she has been referred under the terms less than honourable, preventing him from receiving any advantage.
Is that the case Lyman and other plaintiffs argue or not, it is a long history, says John Turley, a law professor at the Faculty of Law of the University of Washington.
However, it noted, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward.".
Only this doctrine criticised since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I have always criticised the Feres doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same benefits and means of deterrence posed by the responsibility.
"The odds are heavily against them... but it is important that they are trying," he said.
These things change only when the good have the will to fight.
If the trial is not in their favour, Susan Burke, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, will bring its hundreds of other plaintiffs for other trials.
"We will continue to fight against the army on this issue as there will be no reform."
Where "so that we would, one or other of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe's Anders Behring Breivik was just a guy doing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who said he was taken to a murderous madness in Norway in July, leaving 77 victims, was facing his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, it was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support the far-right groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how?
Easy... Connectez-vous to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult that it to find them," said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report released recently by the think-tank on digital DEMOS populism in Europe.
Facebook is so full of personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they seek with scientific precision - the way the mercaticiens do for years.
The team of Jamie Bartlett has discovered that half a million members are fans far-right groups in Europe. It has targeted with the ads, but instead to link it to a new group or product announcements, inviting users to respond to an inquiry. The questions related to their education level, their attitudes to the violence and their optimism about their own future.
In coming into contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 followers of 14 right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"This is a new way of doing research," said Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those that combine online activism and hors-ligne are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
The "study of DEMOS is only an example on how Facebook has become the new essential tool in the hands of scientists.
The groups of reflection, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all the issues that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to the "I love," publications on the walls and updated statutes.
With more than 800 million active users who add content on average three per day, "the supernova data" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research site whose name appears in the title of almost 800 percent over the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people that you could not get in the street.
"Before, when you try to carry out investigations on the people of the British National party, it was very difficult to identify."
"You have to go to the party, but you would never have allowed to enter," said Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could offer a way to identify and deal with the social and health problems.
According to a recent study of D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin - Madison, and colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook their exploits drunk were much more likely to be alcoholics that students discreet about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as advisers, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student whose status would speak too often alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't has diagnosed," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the centre for health, behavior and the development of children in the Research Institute for children located in Seattle, says the Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and which are not recognized in another case."
Facebook also constantly access to information of its users.
The team of the site which handles data has studied the statistics on the situation in love and the day of the Saint Valentine, the rate of participation in the 2010 midterm elections and a national happiness index (information only available - champions digital freedom have long argued that the site could make available its trove of data to others for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site notes, that they like it or not - in exchange for power play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometres, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation which they have not even heard?
While researchers have clearly defined instructions on how to collect the information other than through the Internet, it is anything else online.
"I do not believe that a large number of users have already thought to the fact that a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the Laboratory Knowledge of London, according to a 2006 study he conducted in observing the Facebook walls of its students.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study to be completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two entirely different things," says Neil Selwyn.
That is why, despite his experience as a researcher, Neil Selwyn think a notebook and a pen remain the best tools we can use.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he said.
"The social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and the social, this is not in front of a computer."
"Froid and inhumane": first appearance of's Anders Behring Breivik
's Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted masterminding two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter "resistance" during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and Templiers of Norway," he said before a courtroom packed with 500 people.
"As regards the jurisdiction of the court, I recused, because you want your mandate of organisations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the facts but I am not guilty.".
The judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give him the opportunity to use the trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who has brought with him a speech on paper, talk to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
The judge Nesheim has also asked the Police to keep Breivik in custody 12 more weeks, has forbidden him to speak to the media for four weeks and warned that the authorities would monitor very closely all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came hoping to watch Breivik in the eyes, to be sure he would be placed behind bars.
All attended the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya Norwegian television channel NRK.
"" I was not comfortable, but I personally a little advanced after having seen and heard the suspect. "
Wearing a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He watched journalists and survivors in the eyes in entering and leaving the court.
Despite the odd idea that Breivik belongs to a vast movement of "resistance," the judge determined he was not crazy. He also said there was no evidence that it has acted with accomplices.
The attacks of July 22, seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which - absolutely not perhaps some.
But that does not reduce the grief and confusion felt by the entire nation.
"I would have preferred that it looks like a monster, but this is not the case," said a relative of a victim.
"It would have been much easier."
7 lessons of the interview lost Steve Jobs, film this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, some have compared to Henry Ford - qualified by the technical genius and inventor of the modern computer.
But what Apple fans can find more telling in an interview of Steve Jobs found recently and which will be released this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is how the creative spirit had understood the process and work flow products.
It was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified to a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as a améliorateur of rolls - a man who believed that many business leaders had a "disease their suggesting that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work between a clever idea of a product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Nerds.". This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits down for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he said that the main copies disappeared in transport.
It is only after the death of Steve Jobs that a full video is found in the garage of the director.
This video, slightly rebound, is the basis of the film 68 minutes entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast to the cinema next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate the detailed interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic to expose philosophies technological and business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs is clearly his thoughts, in order to give a precise answer.
We also find times when the perfectionism of Steve Jobs resurfaced, where it seems eager to hear the issues of Cringely, giving him shots for the elbow to speed up and move to questions or issues of greater importance.
Shot before the era of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something eerily prescient on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what he considers good or bad in other companies and its own vision on the future of computing.
It is one thing to read the posthumous assessments of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something of crude and inspiring on the man we see here, the dreamer anxious on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can be and should be.
He explained then put away.
Here is a summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
On the way he has learned to run a business:
"During all these years, I have always asked: 'Why are you doing things?" and the answers are always the same:' Oh, simply because it must do. "
No one knows why, no one is looking at things in a company.
That is what I discovered.
Steve Jobs is giving details on its efforts to simplify the accounting at Apple.
my astonishment about how the costs were registered - often begins with a "standard" valued at cost to nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - he has developed an automated factory that guaranteed the precise calculation of trade costs.
On the opportunity to play a round the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" that he founded with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack the phone networks and free telephone longue-distance.
The device has been the subject of many written beforehand, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He described how he and Wozniak have tested the box using a public phone call and then, in a AT&T network to another while bypassing satellite as possible.
"We enveloppions the ball of different things half a dozen times and you hurliez in the public phone and you arrived a minute later the public phone in hand," says Jobs joked.
"We were young and thanks to the Blue Box, we learned that we ourselves create something capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure in the world."
We do not know much, but we have created a small thing capable of controlling big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I do not believe that Apple would have existed without this one day.
Steve Jobs is telling a wonderful round that he and Wozniak have developed: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue box in the middle of the night in posing for Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the US diplomat, the two accomplices are crazy laugh just before the Pope himself is awake.
On his love with technology (and canvassing of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 years, the hunt for spare parts to build a fréquencemètre, the number of Bill Hewlett in the directory and is a blow over.
Shortly after their conversation of 20 minutes, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"This has been a remarkable influence on me. It" was the only company that I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a business and how employees are treated. "
Steve Jobs is subsequently become one of HP employees to visit the research laboratories of the company, located in Palo Alto, where he found the "first desktop computer ever designed."
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode ray tube. I fell in love.
The teenager that I "was returned in HP and began to write programs for this machine.
On improvisation of innovation:
In several times in the interview, Steve Jobs speaks to invent new products on a whim.
At the beginning of his career, when he moved to sell a few printed circuit boards, a customer asked to assemble a computer.
Working at only 30 days of credit, he had to address the assembly and the delivery of the aircraft finished.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties to develop a computer mouse:
"I remember big wrangling... I cried over claiming that it would take five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I have had enough, I came out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and who proved incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that have stalled:
Even before it does revive Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way many industrial leaders would be wrong and losing control of their market share.
"If you work for IBM or Xerox, you made a better or a better printer, copier and after?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company does not meet more success.
Sales and marketing can change, so [these types of people] that eventually lead businesses and staff specializing in product are put on the "gap of decision-making.
The genius in product that has led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who can't imagine design a good product versus a bad product - the manual work required.
That is what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could hold all the computer industry.
It could be 10 times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They snatched defeat to victory.
On innovation as art form:
"A huge part of manual work between a clever idea of an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot on its intricacies.
There are compromises to do... Some things you can't do, the electrons can, glass, robots, factories.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) in assembling to each other.
Finally, the decisions are taken by personal taste. It is trying to give you the best products that men have created, and try to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have always ashamed to steal good ideas.
That is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who have simply been the best computer scientists in the world.
If not for the computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas dînent with opponents of health law while the court convenes
The day the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to consider the issue of political discord, whether the opposition to the law of President Obama's health will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, have been noticed at a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers who will defend the case before the high court.
The event was last Thursday, when the nine justices gathered for a conference to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases involved a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The justices agreed to hear the complaint, in effect, a monumental argument of 5 is expected in March, and the result will be likely to promote the destabilisation of the 2012 presidential race, which will be booming when the court's decision will be made.
The lawyer who argued before the court and on the rejection of the law, will be Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
The legal firm Clement of Bancroft PLLC, was part of the two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society (Fédéraliste), a group of dedicated to defend the longtime conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that have challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the conference of the court on the case.
If there was, among other top Republican, Mitch McConnell, the Senate and opponent of the health care bill.
The star guests at the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges were present to the events of the Fédéraliste Society for years.
And there was nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, the judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they probably by the TSE Code of Canon 4C, which states: "A judge can attend fundraising organizations related to the right and although the judge could not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or appearing on the program of such an event.".
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two law firms of the case, as well as a business with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of ethical government.
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respect the same rules apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and ate and a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending before the court.".
Their presence and their participation in the collection of funds of this event to dismantle any claim to impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for the critics saying that they mix too easily the affairs of the court with the agenda of groups such as the Fédéraliste Society.
And the wife, Ginni Thomas, is a conservative activist haut-profil.
Moreover, the Tories claim that it is the judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was solicitor general of the Obama administration when the first opposition to the law have been brought in the court of first instance.
His critics have been pressing for Kagan has recused to hear the case, saying it was too invested in the defense of the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that it would.
Boeing has a record of 18 billion dollars for planes
The Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777 airliners, bisexual - corridors, with the option to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners Oman Air, a market estimated at more than a billion dollars.
There was nothing extraordinary in what a company gets an order contemplating 50 of its products.
It is a case when the company in question is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and that the amount of these 50 had reached the record $18 billion.
Equally incredible is that Boeing has received this order: the Middle East, a gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released Monday, the Chicago company believes that the airlines of the Middle East will need in the next 20 years of 2 520 planes worth a total of 450 billion.
Over the weekend, Boeing was informed of the order of the most expensive commercial aircraft in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi - corridors.
It is the Emirates airline based in Dubai who spent this gargantuan order.
Boeing announced at the Dubai Aviation Show 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total amount of the order to 26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that the company Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787 - 8, dubbed Dreamliners, a model who prides himself significant fuel savings and amenities for passengers.
The amount of these six aircraft's "amounts to more than a billion dollars.
"It is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have a huge value."
In the Middle East oil producing countries have a lot of their airlines.
They have not only the means to pay these planes, but a rise in fuel prices - usually detrimental for airlines because it represents their costs the most - would not be so damaging as the country would gain money with oil prices rising.
This is important because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their orders for aircraft when the oil price increases, Dihora reported.
"They have a natural risk coverage," he said.
The order Emirates strengthens the dominance of Boeing on the market for wide-bodied aircraft and help to curb the attempt of encroachment of competitor Airbus with its A350 plane.
The victory of Boeing at air show comes four months after the announcement of Airbus to postpone the start of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777 - 300ER.
Airbus pushes its debut in order to increase the surge following its customers to increase its holding capacity and autonomy.
Shares of Boeing rose 1.5 percent to reach 67,94 dollars.
The Mexican president's sister clearly the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon said that drug traffickers helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon appears to have lost his attempt to access to the functions of governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and it said Monday that drug traffickers have favoured one of his opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for governor of this western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and particularly yesterday is alarming, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon on the radio during an interview on Monday after the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election agents... They snatched ballot boxes, have installed roadblocks... and have forced people to vote for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for 70 years until "to lose the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to be stood out little Calderon, who was leading in the polls before election day.
Calderon, candidate of the Conservative Party of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognise Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, candidate of the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, which currently holds the office of governor, came in third, a painful defeat before the presidential election of 2012 for this left divided and unhappy.
Aureoles has also refused to recognise the results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, has denied any link with drug traffickers and has urged other candidates to accept the results.
The Michoacán has long been dominated by the drug cartels specialized in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is the State of origin of President Calderon, and he chose the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Still, violence has persisted.
A week before elections a mayor of the NAP was assassinated as he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have given up locally to the campaign by fear.
However, for the PRI as corrupt, that the elections of Michoacán have the air, a victory will help the party in its tracks.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo since Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
The BASD urges Asia to help the euro zone
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the eurozone out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy. "
Rajat Nag, director general of the BASD based in Manila, said that the two economic powers to the fastest growth of the world should "do everything in their power" to speed up the recovery of the currency area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He was advised not to the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at the difficulties of Europe of a "indifferent eye" and reported that a financial support to Asian leaders and resources of Europe would help to avoid a collapse in the long term the "global economy.
"We are all together in this crisis."
"Therefore anyone can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected until" at some point but it is not immune. "
"So if China and India can help, that nothing in it."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of borrowing Italian is dangerously skyrocketed and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The burgeoning crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has stirred up fear that the global economy is in recession, and prompted the appeal of the main emerging economies to come together to help the euro area to find a solution.
Mr Nag has hypothesised that the IMF would bring Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance - as buying bonds from the financial bailout fund of the United States, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater power of negotiations to Asian partners of Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Trade and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a drying up of arrivals of foreign capital.
"Nobody wants the euro area remains volatile and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"This is not a choice, it is imperative, because where trouverions-nous work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help European rich when they face their own economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to accept aid to Europe to 1.2 billion Indians, including at least 800 000 live on $2 a day or less.
"One day, they discover that Greeks retire at 50 years and they go on holiday in the sun and they will struggle to swallow," he reported.
Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, has also asked why the reserves of India should be used to maintain many Greek officials paid well in poorly managed that generate losses, as in the rail sector.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis could cause "significant impact" across Asia.
The forecast of the BASD of economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia in 2011 / 2012 now face "the risk of loss" because of the threat.
He pointed out that emerging markets vulnerable needed to develop "backup plans" to protect an economic downturn and significant leaks of capital.
Sévères warnings from the Pentagon on the potential cuts to the defence
The Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, has upped the pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security. It sparked a chain reaction of financial corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan, from gatherings of civilians.
The Pentagon already digesting some 450 billion of cuts for the next decade, but now fears that an additional amount of $600 or more cuts be imminent if Congress fails to agree on spending.
"The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget deal resulting in what we call sequestration would, 23% reductions and the freeze of many new projects.
"A reduction as important, applied indiscriminately and make the most of our vessels and construction projects unfeasible - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm the other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate us from a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay in order to achieve the objective."
"These changes undermine the faith of those who support our military and our preparation would seriously."
The cuts would affect possibly combat troops, continues Panetta.
"Although the funding in time of war accounts contingency operations abroad is not directly affected by the kidnapping, the war effort would be negatively affected by the severe disruption in the budgets of basis," said Panetta.
"The Contracting staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of contract who support the war.".
"The staff manager salaries would be reduced, leading to delays of payment to the suppliers of war, and the legal and political support would be disrupted.".
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a kidnapping on the Defense Department would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as undisputed world leader of military power.".
"We are vehemently opposed to this drastic action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday after - noon at the publication of the letter to Panetta.
"This is not a result with which we can live, and this is certainly not the one that we should impose.".
"The kidnapping is a threat to national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen."
What the letter to Panetta and recent warnings of senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon cuts, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about possible cuts, even if it is reached itself at the top Pentagon post with years of expertise in the budget to Congress and the White House and knowing he was facing difficult choices.
At a news conference last week, Defense Secretary painted a bleak picture of what could happen - one with a shell but no core.
"This is a ship without sailors.".
"It is a brigade without bullets."
"This is a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots.".
"This is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs which did not have enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force depressed, ill-prepared and unable to confront potential adversaries.".
"De facto, it invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlined specifically how further cuts could "generate significant operational risks: response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and risk assumed unacceptable in combat operations future.".
And Panetta said that some of the major defence projects could the axe, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber expected, the marine - new generation missile, the new combat ship coastline and the new vehicle, which would replace the Humvee army and navy.
Putting an end to the development and testing of the F35 could generate 80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say it is an essential step of improvement and response to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at recent headlines suggests how the deception and lies are ubiquitous in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
The directors of Penn State have been accused of perjury for allegedly covered up reports that a football coach to retire has sexually abused boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been taken by an open microphone saying to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroyed careers and convulsé countries.
The member of Congress from New York and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner, went for a fool by issuing denials quickly contradicted by evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of violations of campaign financing related to coverage of an extramarital affair.
And then, no one who has lived the history will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton sparked by lying in his second term on his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating to the school and university are legion.
There have been cases where teachers gave students test answers to do on their assessments of performance.
The mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How deception meet - we?
On any given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of those - these are lies.
Another study showed that foreigners to lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
To detect or identify lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game similar to, say, charades, where the aim is to said: "I have had," the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities have conducted a thorough search of such projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths on lies were démystifiés.
The liars look at you in the eye.
They bégayent, blush or are not always.
Do not conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, the facial micro-expressions, the training of the question and the response time.
I spent several years to review scientific results in the vast body of knowledge and always emerge on the deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern competence that is easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, the interviews, the negotiation or management.
The good liars are adept at reading others, putting them at ease in managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that the extravertis lie more than the introvert, the men say more focused on them "lies" while women say more lies "focused on the other" - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but that the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as an infidel, others will feel less guilty of you lie.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, look at the normal behaviour of your subject.
That is what we call "establish benchmarks.".
This helps to provide a benchmark to measure future changes.
Look at the posture of your subject, laughter, the voice quality.
You have to know if someone is moving normally his feet continuously in order not to make accusations unfair when you see stir the feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then looking for clues of deceptive behaviour verbal and non-verbal.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
The misleading people can stop the upper body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet toward the door, looking towards an exit, change of posture significantly or present a post-interview "relief" - a sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult issues are.
The interrogators often falsely indicate that the maintenance is completed just to seek to trigger the reaction post-interview.
Therefore, made the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson has slid using the past while claiming that his wife murdered was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
The individuals misleading language can also use a beat: "I have not had sexual relations with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat entirely a difficult issue.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "language of wood" during his response to a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember assets... to my knowledge."
This makes the answer perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize the deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid the victimization by scammers in their professional and personal life.
The controversial pipeline will be diverted after the threat of late approval of the United States
A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - prompting the ire of unions while appeasing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline said it is ready to redirect the project to the back on track.
TransCanada said Monday that it will move the proposed pipeline outside the area ecologically sensitive dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a news conference at the Capitol Nebraska.
The official of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, says that the company remains confident that it will eventually get the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision granting a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid areas of the dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, vast underground water sources.
"This is a real way forward," said Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department probably would have delayed any decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although officials deny the involvement of the policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and he expressed his support.
The 2,735 km pipeline would stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He carry 700,000 barrels per day since the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would have to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by labor groups, which have relied on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But the Nebraska lawmakers opposed to this plan are pushing a law to force the remoteness of the area of Sand Hills and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The environmental impact study in the State Department found that the project would have only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said that the inspector general of the Department has ordered a separate investigation of the review process focused on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice by its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly caused a young child to vomit fear
A family of New York says the Disco diva Patti LaBelle launched in a spate of violence in the lobby of their building in Manhattan, has horrified their small daughter to the point where she has vomited fear.
The tirade "Lady Marmalade" singer has frightened the small Genevieve Monk aged 18 months, so that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "the heightened fear of foreigners," said his family during the trial of the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on 10 November last year while the stage technician Kevin Monk, his preschool teacher wife, Roseanna, and Genevieve were preparing to travel as a family.
While Kevin Monk would seek the car, Roseanna Monk snaked down in the lobby of their building Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, Genevieve in his arms.
Roseanna Monk said she was arrested near the door and had asked his daughter for a time.
"Someone came behind me and said:" Do you know what your daughter? "I said" yes "and I went out," she says.
LaBelle has angrily berated the pregnant woman.
"She told me of an aggressive tone:" You shouldn't let your daughter near the door, "said Roseanna Monk.
"I replied:" what you say or think.
She became aggressive and began to use swear - the word "and the word" a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and began to spray water bottle.
She said that at this point, Genevieve became hysterical.
"I said to this woman:" Look what you did to my daughter, "said the mother of the child.
LaBelle pounced on the mother - who was still in his arm Genevieve - and had to be restrained by his entourage has caused to a car, said Roseanna Monk.
The girl was crying so hard that she began to vomit, "she said.
Later, the family has sent a note demanding an apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return our calls for comment.
The complaint asks for unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he has made the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money received at a cancer charity for children.
"The goal is to take Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially against a kindergarten teacher wearing a child of 18 months."
The climate adversity slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez Sinaloa, unemployment and the informalité have increased, foreign investment has fallen and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, auto-appelé of the change, which has generated great expectations in relation to the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity the beginning of the year, the increase is not, there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The temperatures of February from losses of trillions to the agricultural sector, have limited the possibilities of the state's economy for growth, have caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic decline of 31,16 percent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of assignments by the frozen issued by the Mexican Council Rurale Development Soutenable, there has been damage to 582 million hectares cultivated 835, including a 78,03 percent have suffered total damage and the rest of 21,07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops have been vegetables, corn and peas stingy.
The decline in economic activity generated, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the state's unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year there has been a rise accelerated, because during the January to March 55 000 053 sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent Population Economics Active, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent and the July to September the average has continued to raise up to 6.19 percent, a rate that represents more than 74 000 sinaloens unemployed, an increase from the first half of 18 000 969 people.
Less liquidity
The Sinaloa unemployment during the year is multifactoriel, according to the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences of the UAS, rising unemployment can be explained indirectly on the actions carried out by public policy.
"What we see is a rise in unemployment, which is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to fight money laundering, because for people who earn dollars an illegal way is not easy as they work for the win, they use and invest in something," he says.
Migration held
López Cervantes reported that rising unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the state to go to work abroad, the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because as they have already struggling to find work, these people remain here and ask for sources of work, unemployment," said déclaré-t-il.
Lack of serious
The analysis of the labour market sinaloen worsens in considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates between working conditions, according to the INEGI, the 60,38 percent of the working population in this state is working without pay as worker with no social insurance institution.
In part of unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason for the discrepancy are low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labor and Social forecast.
The average monthly earnings of workers sinaloens was, until September, 5 000 352 pesos, well below the national average, which stands at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
As part of the decline in economic activity and rising unemployment, in 2011 we recorded the biggest reduction of Foreign Direct Investment last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June the IED the state has reached 630 697 thousand dollars, representing a decline of 87.74 percent compared to the 143 000 312 5 million dollars registered in the same period the previous year.
In turn, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the Government of the State for a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, recorded mainly by the companies of the service sector.
The debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the Government of the State requested in July at the congress public approval of a credit of $3 trillion pesos, intended to investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipes, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the Congress of the State has been to 2,600 trillion pesos and until November there was no benefit in any sector of the economy of the state.
Reactions
For the representatives of the sector employers, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government.

"The performance of the economy of Sinaloa during this year was really very poor, we must work hard to recover the ground we have lost this year, in 2012 we must double our effort, he took up the effort of all and especially the synchronized already this new team of Government, hope that next year is much better," he says.
Economic Sluggishness
Loredo López said that events like the frozen the beginning of the year have held the state's economy and restricted his performance and growth.
"The low economic fluxe is product of several events, between which the frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy which is fast enough to generate economic dynamism that allows an acceptable level e flow in the trial, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close to - much below the expectations we had," he said.

Many to do
The president of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future which channels the best efforts of the Government.

He pointed out that the current administration has shown advances in the way of management of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware of the fact that there is still much to do," he said.

The financial obligations towards the contributions to the books
The works of contemplés in social programs like Hábitat, Públicos and 3x1 Rescate of Espacios para migrants may not be finished recording where serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of Municipal Social Development said that although so far the construction programs have progressed, they find themselves in a situation of risk, because the Government of the state has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions that exceed the 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
It reported that in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, which the state must provide the 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipe have provided resources for the books, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They must provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon finish they have given nothing, even if since July they should give us a party," he says, "and we, for not registering delays, we started the works and we have a lot of progress, but we need the money.".
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipe had to seek a credit to cover 7 million that the administration of the state had not provided this opportunity - there.
"We had already suffered in the previous sexennal period because the State did not have the economic ability to participate and programmes continue to function and this year we, to have access to these programs, we get the resources to cover what the state had not paid," détailla-t-il.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment from the authorities of the state to provide these resources, he said that they had asked the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate management for the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
"They must provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have given nothing.".
The Court valid "analogue switch-off in 2015" in Mexico
The substitution of analogue know her by the exchange is a more important that the world has suffered the last few years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversy that the Senate and the House of Deputies made against the presidential decree which advance the so-called "analog" cut 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes needed to invalidate have not been met.
A minority of four ministers - included, the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to make the transition to digital television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or not - constitutionality of decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, developed by the Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero, suggested the statement of the decree as not - constitutional, due to the fact that the regulation on radio and television is an award reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of command and subordination of law.
In favour of the project voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and admitting complaints, the Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all actions planned by it for the digital transition.
The plenary session of ministers resolved an attempt by the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project with the Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive may not structure through general standards the measures for the public administration is preparing.
"I believe that if he did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, which has for constitutional mandate the leadership of the state.
The substitution of analogue know by digital know is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered the last few years and this is reflected in a better exploitation of the radio spectrum, signal a better quality and more channels.
Ajourner change, he argued, would be that the benefits of the digitisation that involves a decision of public interest that not only has a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic issues, social, political and national security.".
These questions, he said, "require the operation of a system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the state, includes a group of powers that the Constitution grants the faculty of the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries across the world have already finished the digital transition and they have done through the Executive, despite the fact that they had strong technical bodies.
We cannot conclude that the Commission, in issuing the decree, has invaded a form the sphere of competence of Congress, because it provides in the administrative sphere respect laws issued by the Législative, assura-t-il.
The analysis of the possibility of a "vote by vote count" in Michoacán
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 6 thousand 74 trial - verbal totals.
The possibility of the count "vote by vote" is a reality in relation to the electoral trial this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Préliminaires Électoraux Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 6 thousand 74 trial - verbal totals.
In this sense, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (EIM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, the past 9 November, the electoral body has approved a series of guidelines to harmonise standards to the federal reform.
It is recalled that Michoacán has not licensed nor its Constitution Policy or his or her State Electoral Code Act, Justice Électorale, at the same time that the Congress of the State approved the reforms that will shortly before the legal time limit for that electoral trial can enter into force and the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed its publication in the deadlines set by the Act of the Official Journal of the state, with the argument that he had some objections.
The 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Législative Power and described as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the representative of the state for constitutional reform, because it has no right to "sanction or challenge.".
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote," María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the relevant guidelines by the General Council of EIM it will be possible to achieve the total and partial counting of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial tally of votes, or several electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the trial - coincide verbal; there was no trial - of voting and counting in the case of the ballot box is not among the president; or there are obvious errors or defects trial - verbal.
Moreover, the total count of votes received in all polls of the election will be done when there is an index of the fact that the difference between the candidate supposed respective winner of the election and which won second place in the poll is equal to or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session is express a petition of the representative of the party and / or coalition who presented the second candidates reported.
The total count can also be achieved if at the end of the common count it follows that the difference between the candidate assumed winner and second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the petition specific political party whose candidate came second, cases in which we exclude electoral packages that have been subject of the partial tally.
It should be noted that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of 923 trial - verbal totals.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster
The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has jeopardized all we approach the euro area.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form the Government.
It is expected that it presents a cabinet in his majorities by technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume his post.
Monti said he would present the president the outcome of his conversations with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner reporters.
Monti has not said explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The framework is now well mapped out," he added.
Monti has completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a time more reduced that normally, while Italy fight a political and financial crisis that pushed the cost of its debt to levels impossible to support.
The new administration headed by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to recover confidence in Italy who had been affected.
In adding pressure on Monti to dispatch, the instability of markets to put the performance of 10-year BTP Italian bonds by - above the 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland had to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employers' federation Confindustria, told the media after his meeting with Monti: "We said that we would support the government.".
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy kind of this emergency situation.
The possibilities of success of Monti were boosted considerably by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which the crisis has forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result," said Angelino Alfano, party secretary of centre - right.
The support of PDL party, the largest Italian, is significant because until now many of its members were opposed to the Government of majority technocrat that Monti form.
Parliamentary Support
The new government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to implement what probably will be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could cause a new and devastating attack of financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks is added to the pressure by observing that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti on Monday began consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and organisations juveniles and women.
He will end his tour of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed by Napolitano, who has empowered a rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt are now back to critical levels between the uncertainty on the success of the new prime minister.
Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, it would be too much for the current financial defences of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should persist up to future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions on the fact that politicians will only time to implement the reforms before the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it must be formed only by specialists, an index of their objections to a process required by the financial pressure.
political sources have reported that the mutual suspicion and disagreements between the parties complicate the trial to include political figures.
The Spanish experience is superior to that of the costariciens
Of the 22 players called Spain, 10 participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of 22 summoned participated in 50 games.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, comparing the 22 summoned by the two countries for the friendly today, at 3: 05 p.m. National Stadium in San Jose.
While the national champions and Europe, the number one in the FIFA monthly rankings count, a register of games inter - sélectionnes Class A, the Tricolore only has the defender Michael Umaña as the only one to have 50 international matches.
That figure was reached the last Friday in the game against Panama (0 - 2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of stars and powerful clubs in the Premier League of England, in the year an intense activities in league championships and national cup and disputes in European competitions like the Champions League.
In all this he must add experience with Furia Espanola complicated the playoffs and the World Cup football.
Footballers costariciens, on the contrary, have a limited international experience to an area, as CONCACAF, which is considered a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the record of the Selection is the goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who earlier Saturday against England (defence 0 - 1 in London) has matched the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolore and they will impose a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, of Barcelona, cerebral has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA to the other team's centenarian ibérienne, Zubizarreta mentioned above it - with 126 and before - centre of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Ready turnover centenary is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
In the part of Costa Rica, and nearly Michael Umaña are the left-back Júnior Díaz, with 48 attendances and the striker Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have exceeded the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa, Michael Barrantes with 32 with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The less.
Those who have less. With more than 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national side, with less than 30 attendances, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only a Ólman and Edder Nelson Vargas and start again.
The history of Spain striker David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
In Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who has the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"" Going to Costa Rica is a dream that became reality "
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament, Pearl Jam, said that the group is prepared to offer one of his best concerts the next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They waited more than 20 years, but the group said that for them it will also be a dream to occur in this country.
It is the founding member and bassist Jeff Ament said, speaking exclusively with Viva, Brazil, last week.
The group is in the south wing of his tour - American celebration of two decades of work and Sunday 20 will only stop in Central America.
This day - there will be on the National Stadium, from 19: 30 hours next to the group of Los Angeles The X and national Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt of the conversation, whose full transcript is in La Nacion on the Internet.
For its costariciens followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream become reality. Are you aware of what your fans live?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that became reality for us.
This is our second time in the Central and South America and so far this has been awesome.
I spent in Costa Rica only once the holidays; it is a country so beautiful and I think we can spend a few days.
This émotionne to bring our music - low.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, the fans live with intensity the previous days.
What is your message to your most ardent followers?
Thank you stay beside us for all these years.
There have been 21 years for us to reach Costa Rica; thank you for having waited and we are sorry that so much time had to spend up to the concert.
Some people say that his show is the largest of the year.
Is it adds a little pressure to your visit.
Some of the biggest shows that we have offered during the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We have offered a two huge shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are very eager to produce.
We love this country, we like to do the surfing and jungle; for two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discovered Costa Rica and waves for surfing?
We have a lot of friends surfers and I have a very good friend who lives in Colima and the waves are incredible here - low.
My friends would always make the surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, side of Mexico, are great places to make the surfing; it is as we have learned, through the people who love snowboarding.
Seeing the tour, you have offered huge shows, with a lot of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation to Costa Rica?
As we never products - low, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to do the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good repertoire and various.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is this?
I believe that this is partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and each love songs different, so it is very difficult to choose which songs interpret each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the pool that we have not seen for a very long time, that helps us to stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and we can have forgotten.
That fact that the show is more interesting for us, and therefore I think it is also becoming more interesting for people.
With this tour, you are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, it is difficult to believe everything you succeeded?
Yes, absolutely.
In the first place, I believe that none of us had imagined that we would form a large rock group, and the fact that we have done for more than 20 years that it seems a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and to continue to make music together we émotionne a lot.
We love and we love create music.
We are lucky to go to places of the world that we have always wanted to go.
Things could get better for us.
That means for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
This has always been an honour for us to form part of this group of large groups.
We are friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is very common.
From time to time, a group comes to a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups out at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and it is an honour for us to form part of the group of Seattle.
We are playing with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we have been in Canada with Mudhoney, Soundgarden we have seen in their tour, so we are lucky to still be friends with all of them and it is an honour for us to form part of his of Seattle that arises.
It is also very strange that a group like the your remains united and with the same members for a long time.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) has joined 13 years ago, and only it is much more time than many groups normally last.
In the first place, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive, and second, we are all concerned for the other.
We are all friends and through this there are musical boulevards that give freedom to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with the music and it could only get better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you could do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We ensure that we do not spend too much time on tour because it is easy to fall in this game of big numbers and people who like your music.
If we do not forget that people are there for the music, it helps us not forget that it must respect the music and what has made, set in mind the fact that there is famous and a rock star, which is not really any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we've written good songs and the beginning this was awesome.
We were a group for almost three years and we have not released a new album before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There was a lot of frustrations for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) that began in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a picture I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how it was making me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
It was a human being surprising and we lack.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you have chosen for the opening?
Yes, the production has sent us videos with various proposals and that - there was the group that we liked the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer direct and this must be very distracting.
What you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live?
It is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
It is he who sings and I believe it does with the first words he imagines.
As bassist, what are its influences?
There are both...
Among the first I remember there was Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone Place, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, that I could talk all the after noon on the Baathists - that I love.
How managed Pearl Jam has maintain the grunge despite the fact that it is no longer in fashion?
I believe that we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think, it reminds me of the groups that I mentioned, as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have emerged at the same time and, if it is in now, I think it is wonderful, because it is a music that is worth the trouble to listen and groups like Mudhoney are now the best music ever.
At the beginning, his music had a more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What should this change?
It is interesting, because I believe that there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, as The End gold Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even if those - it can sound a little positive.
With the two, when Ed has played for me, I cried when I listened to and those - these are songs deeply obscure.
I think if you grow up and there was a trauma in your life and you lose a parent or friend, these things are starting to influence your art and your music and songs, without doubt, is it for me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even as it can make music.

According to local media, Mujica is seeking to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France, which took place when the French representative, Nicolas Sarkozy, has included the US south - countries on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy has threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations its ambassador to this European country.
Mexico chairs since November the G20, a group of developed and emerging nations highest in the world, and has in effect with the US south - since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The government has tried in recent years to send the tax exchange agreements to get out of the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implémentent all the international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
On the trade front, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Treaty of Free Trade (TLC), which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustachioed politician plumber the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled, indefatigable, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he had never done in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month to stores across the world, has been designed from the beginning to exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which can play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who must say as to operate the stéréoscopie without glasses," said Nintendo press in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for this medium," because so far the successes as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of Time 3D" was adaptations of existing securities.
The door - floor of Nintendo argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a video game "accessible" which allows a rapid and fluid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang users less adept.
Once resolved, most experts will make a "second round" to the levels of game, which this time - they are more difficult.
In addition, users can choose to real time between a "D" or an aggressive which only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the various challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions.".
The incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also assumes the return of a mobile console, which cannot be passed since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo is a nod to the followers of the saga and repeat the formula for success of previous games, which consists in the fact that the plumber mustachioed politician must go platforms undermined of perils for free to Princess Peach.
Even if I find new player in movements, enemies, environments and costumes and also in the case of Luigi "feasible.".
Colom gives its backing to the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had given orders for the extradition of the former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for conspiracy to the laundering of 70 million US dollars.
Thus ends the trial for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern countries calling for Portillo to the judge.
In press conference, Colom said that his decision follows the independence of the judiciary and executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He said that during his term "it had not helped" in any judicial resolution and gave way to all extradition he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did assume a move after exhausting all judicial and constitutional bodies to try the former agent of the meantime 2004 - 2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Court of Constitutionalité (CC), Portillo should be extradited after he resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and having guaranteed his rights.
Portillo has been absolute for embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, who was the trial that preceded the extradition, but prosecutors appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity is born to avoid marginalisation of young people without training
The toll of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter century.
In addition, the long centenary of jobs obtained currently by this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex Fabra i Coats which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the goal of helping people poorly trained, without work, with substance abuse problems or marginalized.
The celebration yesterday Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of officials of entities and institutions that in those 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The diverse political representation, electoral season, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove.
At the president of the Catalan Regional Government (stretch), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act the former Socialist Education Minister, Ernest Maragall and the former mayor, deputy mayor and current councillor éco-socialiste Ricard Goma.
The also assisted in the large room of Fabra i Coats Minister Of - be Social and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the director general of charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current is too, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis.".
The president gave Trinijove as an example to know fight against bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new to the entity and for the work that it accomplishes," he said.
Owned overrun by squatters for micro-fêtes, evacuated
The invaders were appropriate in 11 of 13 apartments of the building, Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants have abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of No. 51 Rue Balmes lived ended.
Twelve people have abandoned at noon yesterday voluntarily the building they occupied illegally and where they held micro-fêtes who désespéraient the neighbours, by judicial order and without police intervention.
At the end of the operation has changed the lock on the door to prevent the situation again.
"From this day there will be a control of access", affirmât the administrator.
The squatters who had invaded 11 of 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited, have won the electrical and part of the water, in part to paint the walls and leave residues of any kind, especially the cans of alcoholic drinks.
The first three apartments were the scene of masses, which lasted until two days and désespéraient tenants.
Alongside the building there was a disco Balmes, 51, who was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat Europa Press said that as soon as the occupation of the building his case fell a 80%.
The owner of the nightclub mentioned that the invaders of the property was unfair competence, because they were selling the drinks three euros, while in the nightclub they were worth 10.
Moreover, the owner of the local leisure had to respond to complaints from neighbors for noise, while, according to it, the problems were not caused by the clients of the nightclub, but by the inhabitants of the house and above all the participants - celebrations, which were more frequent and intense the past few weeks, according to the neighbours angered the area.
The head of the disco explained that the problems were so big that it has even led to an agreement with the owner of the building and it nine months that it "forgive the rent."
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that the last few weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors for this situation.
The president of the group of municipal mayor, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested the week past "the immediate evacuation of the building to finish with the problems of life and civility that it caused to residents and the degradation of the zone.".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only a floor of the building was occupied, but last month the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were flights.
It is in this sense, he added that "we must end impunity and be relentless against anti-social behaviour generated in the property.".
Yesterday, the local police (Mossos Catalan) has evacuated a building at Nou Barris.
In 15.30 hours the police moved to the No. 35 Rue Mount - bilaterally, having received the call from a neighbor who had observed that four people gained access to the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Parc or mountain?
The architects coincide on the opportunity of the convening the - beyond the controversy over the fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
By the middle of the 1980s, at the height of the already extinct - Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration has printed posters promoting Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as the biggest park in the metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the New York's Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the higher limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital is the only one who is not heading on the axis north – south, if not high (low) - (sea).
The classification of Collserola as natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was not Central Park or Yellowstone, with boar in the role of the bear Yogi.
This was the situation until, in September, the mayor convened a mega - competition composed by 16 competition for all the doors of access to Collserola.
A door to the idea of park, no doubt.
That is, or someone wants to put doors on the field.
The question appears alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organisation as regards the reflection on the city is a topic of conversation all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme, including two former members of that caste elected to speak when they recognize in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions on which coincide three architects of Barcelona, university professors, who are presented.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is appropriate.
For Roldán, after the coastal front "it is necessary to" discuss "the mountain front" because the speech Ildefons Cerda, green blocks has not been led to end.
"It must start from the basis that the park more extended Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex, "gave the verdict the architect for which the title of" Collserola "contains a" trap "lexicon: we must think about those - it" as access to a park, but the delimitation of some areas in which it must act. ".
Modol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, described the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some peril.".
There are perils of "the uncertainty of projecting public space" after the experience in the 1980s and has been in the area of the Forum, "his swan song.".
The first fear is the demarcation of borders on which we can build.
"Limiting something means making the next step," i.e., the excess.
"We must think about new instruments, urban planning, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (MGP)] can cause genuine disasters.".
By taking over the issue, Modol said that, by simplifying the side of the region El Valles de Collserola "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no.".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat of Collserola which "must not be lost," thanking the city for the opportunity to offer his corporation to intervene in this project "from the first time.".
Moreover, he meant that the proximity of the mountain with the city is - except that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" whether this looming technique must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a success," he says) that it is creating: "We, the architects, should only be an instrument.".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because of the bases of the competition it lack a global vision of Collserola: "It was summoned 16 horizontal competition - he says - in the sense mountain - sea, but there was not a longitudinal reading that way and understands the area as a whole.".
This fact, at least in this case, he has opted to participate in the 16 competition.
In a different way, a project for a doors can shock in the programme and definition with that of the architect of the door.
In his opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the band immediately above that of Ronda of Dalt should, in all its extension, an area of equipment that performs a gentle transition between the city and green.
Casino forgive Jonás Larrazábal and it will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal authority of the Casino Red has granted the pardon in the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail
After 72 years, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the based legal power of Casino Red grant forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the bombing of the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, has published a series of photos and videos in which presumably Manuel Jonás him required the payment of a quotte for the mayor of Monterrey allows the functioning of the house.
After public denunciation, the prosecutor opened a criminal trial against the brother of Mayor PANiste and 2 September it was arrested and held in provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecution of Offences 3 Patrimoniaux, he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1 Montpellier, located in the capital of the state.
He remained there for the 49 days when he delivered a second detention order after the agent of the public prosecution has dismissed the charges of corruption and organised crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the criminal centre Cadereyta alleged to have made singing with one and a half million pesos the owners of the Casino Red; but he spent only a few hours in the detention center of average because there were death threats against him.
The authorities have allowed him to continue the trial reserved in the municipal cells San Nicolás Colliery de los Garza.
On 25 October a capture order was issued by the Clerk of the Second District Criminal Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation confirmed there was evidence sufficient to determine the guilt of Jonás, such as the one on the collection of 1.5 million pesos representatives home game in exchange to allow its operation.
This Monday, founded the legal authority of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, is presented by before Judge Jose Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom during the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the agent of the prosecution service attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias said García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and that associates of the home game had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to disclose the name.
By virtue of the record 197 / 2011 we grant legal forgiveness to Jonás Larrazábal and later we will not make any claim on the lawsuit against him; we see no damage and no punishment.
After the hearing of the legal power to the house, at 15: 50 hours we ordered the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved up to the municipe of San Nicolás Colliery de los Garza to communicate to Jonás that he had been forgiven legally and his file would be classified.
He will be the order of immediate freedom that the judge issued.
The Secretary Dionisio Perez Jácome gives discloses the details of the air crash in which has lost his life the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and another seven people
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) informed that the results highlighted on the accident in which has lost his life the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people, indicate that the helicopter was shocked directly against the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot can try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Perez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, said that before the takeoff of the aircraft, the pilot found that climate conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit has had various contacts with the ground the blades have had contact with the trees to 25 yards where the unit has lost the fuselage.".
He informed the fact that the unit was designed to 19 people, therefore it met the requirements needed to transport staff.
Moreover, he said that the investigations made in the area of impact do not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a search has been reported that there was no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact of structural way.
"The helicopter had been designed to 19 passengers and met the requirements for transport.
The ground had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the moment, the secretary said a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation may take a few months, it may even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, director general of Airports and Services Auxiliaires said that the moment of impact, the helicopter to the Presidential Major worked in speed of cruiser and this happened on a bottom-up soft ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of a normal functioning cruiser at the time of the impact," he said.
During the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, has listed six important elements in the investigation:
Flight visually:
According to the aviation standards, the flight was conducted under visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather:
The reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions at takeoff, and the aircraft has progressed to the boundary zone between City and the state of Mexico there were layers of low cloud cover.
Routes selected:
It is likely that "because of the conditions of cloud cover the crew has sought a height lower and more visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the impact.
The details of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there has been no loss of control or alteration of the trajectory of flight.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in an area reduced:
The information available so far suggests that the impact took place on a trajectory right lateral and.
The model of dispersion of the remains of the aircraft suggests that the helicopter was hit on the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
The was not detected traces of fire or explosion:
In the place of the sinister there was still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the work of ground was found pieces of the aircraft at a height of 9 000 200 feet - above the average level of the sea, the soil had a slope that goes for seven dégrées to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he is possibly thrown out of joint throughout his journey.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impactes with the soil.
After careful research in an area further that the place surrounded, around the accident, it has not found disperses parts of the aircraft, which bears the presumption that the impact took place in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announcement protocol to find the gene for obesity
Social Insurance heads an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people; this is borne by the IPN
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) announced he leads an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people, called yet protocol of obesity in children and adolescents who will have the markers associated with being overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Unit for Investigation Médicale in Biochimie of the Hospital of Spécialités Medical Centre National of the 20th century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that it had formed a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social attend.
This team is supported by specialists and students of third round of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Investigation and Advanced Study (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation are invited to participate the population having or not right, to run in the IMSS sports units participating in Valle of Mexico City, where is the evidence to minors every Saturday from 8: 00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol has started in the Cuauhtémoc Medicine Unit (Estado de Mexico City Poniente) and from 8 October, the activity is taking place in the Medicine Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de Mexico City Oriente).
After reaching the goal of getting 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in Medicine Unit Independencia (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Morelos Medicine Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the purpose of this investigation and that e know the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and identify among children and Mexican youth risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As we celebrate the 14 November the World Day of the Diabètes, he mentioned that the objective is to meet three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires relating to food.
They will also be requested on their physical activity and their family history of heredity diseases, to avoid the risk factors that trigger health conditions like diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that Saturdays we will apply to all participants of anthropométriques measurements (weight, height, circumference of the size), determination of blood pressure, glucose levels, cholesterol, triglycerides and insulin (the genetic and seeks to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals to the alarming weight in the case of minors.
'The health investigations of 1999 and 2006 reported that in just six years there has been a rise in the case of boys, 77 percent in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 percent; in regard to overweight there has been a dramatic increase, pointed out the IMSS specialist.
He said that the justification for the search markers is based in the fact that the country's population is different from other genetic history.
He informed that, on average, have a Mexican 65 percent of heredity US-India, a 30 percent and a five percent African and this condition is reflected in people with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is reflected in the inability to burn excess that consumes energy (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher said that the direct benefit for participants is the full valuation of children, which can detect if they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of the folds of dark colour (acanthosis) on the neck and arm before - indicate the probability of developing metabolic changes and even meadow - diabetes.
The information is managed in a way, the doctors call by writing to parents, which explain each of the measures and changes in the style of life that they must do to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: the physical inactivity, which is the lack of physical activity daily, remain most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use of means of transport instead of going off on short distances.
Another issue is the high caloric intake, i.e. the greater consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales - block of meat to maize flour wrapped in sheets of corn, bread, pizza, hamburgers etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetic analysis in this protocol.
The asphalt of UNAM would avoid blackcurrants
Rafael Herrera, a researcher from the Faculty of UNAM, equaled the development of asphaltes modified with polymers to produce a mixture with a better performance, regardless of the environmental conditions and temperature
If the know that the streets were resolved, it would not be necessary to fix about 200 000 blackcurrants each season of rain in the Metropolitan Zone of Valle of Mexico City, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher from the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who said that if the process of construction and maintenance of the paved sands is adequate, blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During its conference A technological opinion on the blackcurrants, organised in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory which he is responsible developing asphaltes modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with a greater resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of asphaltes modified could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the performance and, therefore, the training of blackcurrants.
He explained that the asphalt, the more heavy oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with a higher molecular weight, called asphaltènes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthènes, which together give the paved his characteristic viscoélastique behavior.
The viscoélastique behavior of asphalt is the fact that at high temperatures, nearly 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and 50 degrees C it presents an almost solid, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt is slashing, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on the environmental conditions and temperature, the specialist in chemical engineering.
The researcher of the FQ observed that the streets of Ciudad in Mexico City in their majority were covered by a flexible, composed of six layers of materials, including the last three imply the asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the layer of asphalt, formed by small stones drenched in asphalt and packed later.
Each small stones that form the layer, he warned, is bathed year asphalt.
When the vehicles spend generating efforts, it allows that the forces spread very well in the streets.
If we had the asphalt amended, those - it will be better, opinât the ingénier chemical.
On the layer of asphalt, he says, is a last layer called layer of turnover, made in stone, i.e., sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As it is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical force that the layer of asphalt and provide grip in the street.
As part of that receives and distributes the efforts, the layer of turnover also requires it to have a proper thickness and the material it is made must be treated.
The climate, especially the humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to consider, especially the water, he says, because those - they affect significantly the performance of the layer of asphalt.
When the ground is, the water spreads inside the layer is that it is difficult, which ramollie all sections of the streets and therefore cause of blackcurrants.
In the trial of training a blackcurrants, he says, the first which is spoiling the film and only later turnover is affected the layer of asphalt, but the injury did not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signs with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System Chercheurs explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor for the training of blackcurrants and therefore the thickness of each layer of the stone must always be linked to the burden of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid the formation of blackcurrants.
Rafael Herrera warned that there was still much to investigate and work on the asphalt emulsions, for example, the bitumineuses, which in other countries are already on the market and help repair the blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What has failed to the candidate of Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that have made that Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives his title No. 14 of Princess.
In new Valle del Cauca stayed with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time - and Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the podium winners, wear the crown of money and the band that accredits as new Princess of Colombia.
With the result last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is rising with the crown and sceptre, the Department sum already 14 titles of Princess and Melina is a to a legion of women of Valle del Cauca who are found near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, between which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Now the big question that many of the world is:
What he missed? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favourite in each presentation has demonstrated that it had to be the new Miss Colombia, because it had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie Vogue, securities obtained by queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who have won the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first key factor in the decision taken by the sworn to designate First Princess is the fact that she was not satisfied with his answer to the question "? What was the book that marked and why? by Martín Murillo Gómez, Carreta Literaria Leamos.
This is the response of candidate of Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in the literature, I believe that it is a form of culturaliser, definitely I think the book that marked my childhood is" The Little Prince, "is a book deep enough.
Now I read "Crime and Châtiment," this is a book of universal literature that we should read all; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The fervor of the blood."
This response has not rained firstly because of the term "culturaliser" and secondly not to explain specifically how every book quoted had marked.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt quiet and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all the world, please read a little, "The Little Prince," is a great book "
Among the assumptions launched that Valle was destroyed by the patronage.
A reporter of Bogota has insinuated that being the favourite, and announcing the candidate who received all the preliminary price (challenge of gastronomy Oster, the public vote for the best homemade costume, and Queen Mother), "it has awakened the envy of other candidates, has stressed the Queen and that is why it has not shone on the stage.".
And it noted that in his first presentation in swimsuit at the beach of Hilton and two parades the eve of the coronation.
Even if the two parades she had appeared self-confident, we noted that she had not the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the programme "Como in casa" (As at home), the Canal NCR said that the fact that Melina was named Princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most prices during the competition does not receive the crown of Queen.".
Moreover, Valle avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince the board on his interest in social initiatives, which is the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That is why two days before the election the international juror Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a committed woman in regard to the social needs of his country.
"Only the beauty is not sufficient in a Miss Colombia - need to look beyond the physical and focus on his social sensitivity, that before starting the competition are already involved in projects," expliqua-t-elle.
One speculates that Valle has sinned by its flaws of his behind fibrosis and who was in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, precisely because the jury was elected as the candidate 'natural Beauty' with the body more healthy, good diet and physical work.
The preparer queens Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina had not the best body, it had better, "but his problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me was not too well known, has left marks the last day.".
Between - time the journalist Guido Hoyos, the journal Cromos sees the error of the candidate of Valle were the surgeries she had suffered.
"The surgeries are good, but Valle has not been able to.
His body has never been its asset and she lost because of this aspect. ".
For this price, that the National Contest of Beauty calls for the first time, after the parade in swimsuit has emerged a cruel prediction that was done yesterday evening, saying that this was a small gift that Raymundo to Melina for not giving him the taste of the crown.
Réalité or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year, not as sovereign, or as Princess, a position that gives him the opportunity to represent Colombia in an international competition by appointment of the Contest National.
However, it will go down in history as one of the queens that despite his dazzling move by Cartagena, has not won the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A dactyloscopiste of Cali is history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials is crucial.
The past November 4, a dactyloscopiste of the Cali ITC has history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC, "Alfonso Cano", by confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopistes who work in the local offices of the ITC, this week it was the turn of "availability of Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada who works for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipes of Chocó, where many times he had to spend five days in the forest to reach the place in which were the bodies that were to be identified.
The year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after appropriate courses, he specialized in fingerprinting, which is the study of the skin of friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano had been warned to Eliazar to take with him clothes at least for three days.
Something very big expected.
On Friday night is party to Cauca Palmira in a helicopter.
He knew he had to identify two bodies and suspected that one of them was the man who ran the world's oldest guerrilla, therefore asked to take the card with the ten Guillermo León Sáenz fingerprint (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigative team to the location of the body, it has not recognised by his physical aspect, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed as a peasant in the area, without glasses and much more.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtonienne, ink sampling, and a lamp, Eliazar has compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
His eye was deceived: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed the Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, it was the supreme leader.
In research footprint
For a dactyloscopiste of Sijín of Cali recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos is to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano," is very significant.
Many people is not our work.
The fingerprinting is an exact science, no margin of error, which can be crucial in solving crimes.
In part to identify bodies, the dactyloscopistes supports the investigation for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of those captured.
When are caught, many have false identity cards or have no documents.
We take their fingerprints and seek in the database.
The researcher told that in a case of theft he had to remove part of a wall of a house, because in this place the thief had supported his hand to get a boot - very full of jewellery and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate areas to draw a fingerprint, but in this case we have been able to get the footprint of the hand and identify the offender who had participated in various flights," he recalls.
The fingerprints can also rule out or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently we found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him.
For interlude investigation has determined that a relative can be suspect of the crime and a footprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if this No guarantees that it is not the killer, that the place on the scene of the crime.
A dactyloscopiste of the ITC said it extracted "fingerprints objects with physical or chemical reagents.".
When they appear, using a sampling or a band for the levy.
In addition, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the data base of offenders, or the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombian," said the expert of the ITC.
He explained that not everything is how it shows in the television programme CSI.
As all that glitters is not gold, all that touches is not necessarily a footprint.
It can be used, if the confrontation is necessary.
The "indignant" defy the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded in Zuccotti place to camp.
A lot of people have acceded to the evacuation order and has moved to a nearby park.
The movement's integrative Occupe defied Wall Street Tuesday New York authorities trying to enter again, thanks to a judicial order, in place of Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Great Apple.
Hundreds of protesters crowded outside the place Zuccotti, where they wanted access through a judicial order that allows' outraged 'camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement has responded to the evacuation in a park north of the city, where there has been new judgments.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to stand again in the place, we will install in another place and we will continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful protests," said - a door - words "Occupe Wall Street," Mark Bray.
Bray has detailed the answer of 'outraged' to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, came up to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order which prohibited the forced evacuation of the place, and allowed the demonstrators to remain in the camp.
Moreover, the 'indignant' occupied a new park located at the confluence of power stations Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, between New York and New Jersey, property of the parish, Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they have managed to occupy the place, but after the Police is moved and arrested a few protesters, although Bray could not confirm the figure concrete Efe, the fact that he has seen a few journalists who had also spent handcuffs.
The organization ensures that there are 100 people who were in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in a sign of support to members of the movement and tried to intervene in favour of them before the Police.
Between - time, place Zuccotti - which is a forum of private property - remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which we must analyse the legality of the evacuation of this morning.
Some protesters moved previously focused and handing out at this time - where copies of this judicial order and they were the same to the officers who were monitoring the place, which has caused some small clashes, "said Bray, who has denounced the fact that some officials have hit the protesters.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities to evacuate the members of Occupe Wall Street or to apply the laws published after the beginning of the occupation or prohibit the demonstrators to park with tents or other properties they used before.
The Mayor Bloomberg said that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the demonstrators, to which he was alerted to the fact that local laws do not allow to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The councillor has personally championed the evacuation at dawn in Zuccotti, an operation during which was arrested 200 people and that was because of the fact that the protesters' violated the law.
Bloomberg said he had given the order to evacuate the place because it was becoming "a place where people came to protest, but for violating the laws and in some cases, to do harm to other people," because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "to their quality of life.".
"The evacuation of this morning at dawn was repugnant and shows that Bloomberg is more concerned to defend the financial interests than those of American workers," added the door - floor of the movement, which accused the mayor "not to respect freedom of expression.".
The Occupe "Wall Street" have also said they did not think hold "major actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two months of protestes, which began on September 17.

The Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant Tim Allen in "Home Improvement," "Baywatch," Wahid rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special programme of Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, the "baladin" (young crooner Michael Bublé and other famous Canadian, will emerge in the television program "It's was Russell Peters Christmas" the next 1 December interpreting a very special Virgin Mary.

Japan is returning after the earthquake
The GDP rise a 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the downward spiral of the beginning of March
Since March the Japanese economy was severely crippled, even after the devastating earthquake that became nuclear crisis, the worst disaster of the Japanese country since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo have calculated the material losses to 300,000 million dollars, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to be mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, data of gross domestic product between July and September served to definitively turn the page: GDP has raised a 1.5% from the prior quarter and a 6 percent annualized rate.
Anyone registered the second quarter - for the Japanese fiscal year begins in March 2012 - requires, in addition, the highest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is due, in part, by the recovery of the acquisition of equipment to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies have increased their investments by 1.1 percent, compared to the decline of 0.9 percent of capital spending observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of increases not - interrupted.
However, the true stimulate the Japanese economy is based exclusively on the Keynesian stimulus to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, use the shortcomings to grow zero.
Japan has awakened thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of GDP.
This variable has raised a 1%, driven by the increase in spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The yen's stigma
Tokyo is handed over to the internal market when the yen the Japanese currency - - has become a "safe-haven" elected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the eurozone and the United States forecasts, a privilege that weighs as a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger divides, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, have been responsible for their weak results between July and September the assessment of the yen.
While the markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not drop the guard.
"We must follow the risks persist, as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," reported yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that the majority of Member countries have presented in September clearer signals of economic slowdown.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points of the global economy has highlighted that the major powers are curtailed.
Because it fell four decimal points up to 100,4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone was even by - below the average, which is in the 100 level, dropping eight decimal points up to 99,13 points.
Athens is fueling new doubts
Papadimos said that the adjustments will be approved, but the Tories not sign any written commitment
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty relocated in parks, Greece continues to become entangled in the maze that led to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The sensation of the "consensus" of the new transitional government is Helennic; rather imposed by the demands of Brussels by a real conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos reported yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of 100 days establishes in its designation may be short to apply, the leader of the Conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, said that he would not support the new austerity measures in no case and reiterated its demand new elections for the datte scheduled for 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October," said Papadimos when it opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras No emerging doubts about his position: "We are committed to help the transitional government, but we are committed to nothing more.".
The Conservative leader went a step further in his pulse that EU and IMF, organizations must release the 8,000 million that Athens needs with urgency, and said clearly that it will not approve any letter of commitment adjustments.
But the European Commission, irritated by the impact caused by the will - all of the referendum of Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that his requirement is firm: it will not help if the new government and leaders of the main parties hellènes do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible.".
The door - floor of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the troika would return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "the elements needed to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, even if there is a definite date.
The Greek still have much to do.
The Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stresses the "paramount" to Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a prominent place at global level in the role of Micro-finances.".
The Queen Sofía recalled that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the planet in relation to this cooperation instrument which "the essence" lies in the fact that it is "an instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in the human being.".
The Queen opened yesterday the V - e World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid with the certainty that there was "no doubt" that such operations are "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, in particular, has as its goal the reduction to half the volume of people with incomes under a dollar a day, which is set the poverty threshold. ".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and this task with" responsibility, "reported the Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions origins during the summit, which will last until Thursday," guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poor, and especially for women, "the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have achieved many objectives "and" we face many challenges. ".
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a for debate, but also as the platform from which to spearhead "two basic goals.".
Thus, His Majesty explained that the goal is that at the end of 2015 there has 175 million poor families who have acceded to these financial services and that 100 million of these families out of poverty threshold in which they now live.
The momentum in the design of micro-credits in Spain and in the rest of the world "followed the trail initiated a few years ago in a pioneer" by Muhammad Yunus, said the Queen Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition.".
And she has described the father of this instrument as an "idealist admirable in the universal cause of the fight against poverty," the work which she has known since 15 years ago, when the Queen has travelled to Bangladesh to get on the ground its lending policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings as those held in the Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "in every meeting I could see a continuing evolution," said His Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the term "head of family" meeting in Valladolid from "as the deep pocket of the poor.".
Finally, the Queen Sofía finished his speech by encouraging people to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"ethical" Impératif
The Extérieures Affairs Minister, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, it stated that it would be a mistake to vinculer cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, because it is "a permanent obligation.".
Jiménez considered that micro-credits assume "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty," and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and do not let that be the victim of the cutbacks.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of cooperation for development.".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success of" give "trust" the people "excluded which all close the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León the Riva, welcomed the people in a city that opens its doors contaminated the spirit of solidarity. ".
The CDU proposes to elect the president by universal suffrage, European
The first day of the convention of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) - Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, ran without real difficulty for Chancellor Angela Merkel, but also president of the Christian Democratic party -.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme but finished in the fall, particularly to meet the militants who consider government policy too lenient towards the Greeks today and the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously -.
On 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which have been right at the end of their interventions, Angela Merkel and, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the finance minister, very Europhile did not place in doubt.
The idea - mistress of Chancellor - and the motion – is a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe but more Europe.".
Not only because Europe is peace but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe.".
That could mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the eurozone countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission to universal suffrage "to give a face to Europe.".
That is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty - Seven agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.
But the milestone.
Similarly, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the weight of each country to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank on the weight of each economy, which of course was to strengthen the weight of Germany.
Seeking to ease the climate inside his party, the Chancellor has repeated references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl But she has not sought to win its congress on the back of the "smaller" European countries or countries in difficulty quick to criticise the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of the "Franco-German friendship," Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in hollow.
In recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, this was one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon's army.
What does fraud rulings disease?
After the benefits, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on the judgments disease.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box of family allowances, and deliver a speech on the recurring theme - since 2007 - the fight against fraud and social handouts.
And to accompany this offensive, which share a willingness to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less a harbinger of an axis of the presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on the judgments disease.
First in a goal of budgetary savings: the government plans to impose the employees of the private waiting a fourth day before taking charge of a work stoppage.
In clear, specific business agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days wages, so at least 15 percent of his monthly income.
A measure that threatens to spark anger, but which would yield EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic: the civil servants waiting a day not compensated in the event of work stoppage (they so far have not waiting period against three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also stimulus the issue of fraud, targeting this time abuses linked to the work stoppages.
"The checks will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you rembourserez," said Xavier Bertrand on Sunday, November 13.
As for other cases, the announcement effect seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of fraud to the work stoppages.
This is the subject since 2002 of constant monitoring and offensives policies, which have often borne fruit.
The French not sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
Attardons we first on the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros per diem allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute of research and documentation in health economics, daily allowances in 2008 accounted for 5 percent of health spending, with 11.3 billion euros.
Of this, $46% were the maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% were the judgments disease, or 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French on average 14.5 days of work stoppage, against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
An average to hide some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of 40 000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any day off sick.
Another study, this time of the Sickness, states that in 2010, 37% of the judgments were less than 8 days, 22% 8 to 14 days, 15% 15 days a month, 15% of one to three months and 11 percent in the - beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, the French are not more likely that the stoppages.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the rate of overall absence (for health reasons or not) perched in France, between 10% and 11%, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15 percent in the United Kingdom - or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands -.
The fraud rulings disease is very little work in the black.
As to the fraud, it reached a low scale.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 that the systematic checks are on the judgments of more than 45 days.
In 2008, about 1.5 million tests, the CNAM found that 13% of 285 000 made for short-term rulings were "unjustified or too long," 37 050 case.
In the case of judgments of more than 45 days, routinely checked, there were 11% of cases "inappropriate or unwarranted" on 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, 169 000 cases "unjustified," on several million employees who had a disease.
A figure which represents little face, for example, of the black economy.
According to the UMP lawmaker Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would be 9 to 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, or more than the total cost of the daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud.
Papadémos: Greece will apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a further adjustment programme to revive its economy.
That is what said Monday 14 November the prime minister, Lucas Papadémos, before Parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his government would not be sufficient to accomplish this task.
"To continue the efforts of recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the head of government, who gave his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on October 27, will be the "main task" of the new government, because the country's participation in the euro zone "is at stake," he added.
As a result, Mr. Papadémos has forecast that the country's public deficit will be reduced to "around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after having been 10.6 percent in 2010 and 15.7 percent in 2009.
The right wing refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right-wing Monday expressed its support for the measures already agreed to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not engage on additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with members of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and combat the waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic recovery.
A Olli Rehn, the European commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU does not would contribute US loan of EUR 8 billion needed without written guarantee to all parties that they would support the measures, Antonio Samaras responded that his floor enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It must legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide, said a committee of experts
The Canadians live in denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, institutions of health care, and doctors are working together to ensure better palliative care, and that - beyond the cases of cancer.
The Canadian company lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk with their doctor the conditions in which they want to die and take provisions to this effect.
It is one of the conclusions of a report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The committee recommends that the government to amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when this choice, with a patient deemed competent to take such a decision.
From the outset, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which has compared the quality of death in 40 countries in the world.
If Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to broach the subject of death.".
Médicalisation or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts are mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the wish that have most Canadians to die at home, $68.6 percent of them eventually dying in the hospital.
Overall, the country is in Quebec that this rate is the highest, with 86% of deaths at the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said it does not want to change anything in the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all the countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalised, there was no evidence that decriminalization of abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on competent persons not willing or not.
On the contrary, said yesterday in a teleconference Jocelyn Downie, author of the report, there would be many more cases go precisely where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.".
"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," said Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
Remember that 85 percent of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of life to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010.
And 66 percent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of elderly or disabled has less value.
As for the people who practiced assisted suicide, 41% of respondents felt that they should not be prosecuted.
In terms of retention or termination of care with a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
So, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a refusal legally valid is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also urge that health professionals are trained to the duty to respect a refusal by the end of life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, institutions of health care, and doctors are working together to ensure better palliative care, and that - beyond the cases of cancer.
Finally, in the field of palliative sedation or terminal illness, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee asks that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce the physical pain, such as euthanasia, and it is subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the report of experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Mr. Pierre Fields, a specialist in health law, called "extreme" the position of experts signatories of the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia for the terminally ill.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and have more than 18 years could ask what help to suicide," said Mr. Fields, who had consulted yesterday a summary of the report.
Mr. Fields also stresses that the authors of the report seem to put the autonomy of the individual - above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
"in society, he says, there are beacons and constraints.".
The health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, she called it "manifesto pro-euthanasia.".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular the data in the report about the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide were legalised, either in the Netherlands, and Oregon.
The King of Jordan called President Assad to leave power
Damascus denounced a "plot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad marched yesterday outside the offices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Syria of Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, their resists and denounced a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took position in favour of a departure of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the first Arab leader to call President Bashar al-Assad to leave power "in Syria, where 40 civilians and members of the forces of the regime have been killed.
"If Bashar had to heart the interest of his country, he should resign, but it should also create conditions for a new phase of Syrian politics," said King of Jordan's neighbour, Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For its part, the Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have failed.
"Those who are not in peace in the Middle East - with their people and cannot meet will leave," he said, referring to Syria, neighbouring country which Turkey adopted an increasingly tough line.
The United States are on their side welcomed a "strengthening of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime", after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey adopt an increasingly hard" against the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a door - floor of the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the forces of the regime have been killed in the Deraa region in southern Syria, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Two other civilians were killed "in crossfire and shelling with heavy machine guns to Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said that the country is "heading towards the end of the crisis.".
It has also reacted strongly to the Arab League decision to suspend Damascus of its work, which is "a dangerous step.".
"Syria does not shrink," he said, adding that "the ourdis plots against Syria will fail.".
After his decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "mechanism of protection of civilians" and wants to send 500 members of Arab organizations of human rights, media and military observers in the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe is also said to support the dispatch of UN observers to help protect civilians of the repression of the regime which he said is the "paranoia.".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat on the implementation of the plan to exit the crisis decided on 2 November and including the withdrawal of forces from cities in the dispute and the release of demonstrators arrested.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, said yesterday "incorrect" the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the plan to exit the crisis, while guarding support possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti request time to markets and sacrifices Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for a bit of time to markets to form his team and implement a program, which will include "sacrifices" to recover the lost credibility in the final months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before now meet the unions and employers.
It should put in place a relatively small cabinet of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a lot of sacrifices," said Francesco Mr Nucara, MP for one of the many small groups involved in the talks, after he met the President of the Council.
The president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said expect Mario Monti requests by a vote of confidence in Parliament to ensure that the new government has enough support.
The consultations will end by the presentation by Mr Monti of a restricted list, probably a dozen ministers, the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti said the nervousness of the bond and stock markets yesterday, asking them time.
In "democracy, there are deadlines" to prepare a government and its programme, he said, saying he was "certain that the markets will be patient and understand.".
His appointment by the president had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern has regained the upper hand especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The first minister designate should be a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "political.".
The new government must last until 2013, the date of the next elections, he said.
According to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti is committed, once entered office, to work in the emergency and in order that Italy will "protagonist" in Europe.
A door - floor of the European Commissioner Olli Rehn said that "even with a new government, our diagnosis on the Italian economy does not change.".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not reach its goal of a balanced budget in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has asked for new austerity measures.
The "boss of bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will on Tuesday, insisted on the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has not of growth may not meet the parameters of deficit.".
Mr Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994 – 2004), represents a "change of time" to Italy after 17 years of "berlusconisme", the "professor" symbolizing the "serious challenge" and "another Italy," according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
The President Napolitano would avoid early elections because Italy must place by April 2012 to 200 billion euros of government bonds.
A Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator used with a nuclear weapon, said Monday the American NGO specialising in the nuclear risk.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Agency for Atomic Safety and other documents from the UN agency to identify.
The IAEA said last week its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimensions" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS dipping widely in documents of the IAEA, Danilenko, born in 1934, worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear center at Chelyabinsk, and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by the explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamants" in Kiev.
The economic problems of its society have led to contact the embassy of Iran in Ukraine in 1995.
He then allegedly cooperated in the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before his return to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA is "strong indications that the development by Iran of a nuclear detonation system" has been helped by the work of a foreign expert, which not only knew this technique, but, as a Member State has informed the Agency, has worked for most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear programme of his country of origin.

The anti-Muslim crimes and offences rose 50%
The crimes and offences against Muslims have risen nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, the other racial and religious violence have fallen slightly or little progress, according to FBI statistics made public Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence perpetrated against Muslims is past 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49 percent increase, against a rise of 13 percent of the violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% of offences against Jews and an increase of 14 percent of crimes and offences anti-religious.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose marginally to 6 628 cases, including 47.3 percent motivated by differences of race and 20% by differences of religion, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offences rise again," said the human rights organisation Human rights First, "the increase in antimusulmanes violence is particularly significant," the organization said in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long said that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," said one of the leaders of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The US government can and must do more to tackle these abuses," he said, adding that this could happen by improving police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in the US federal law is a legacy of the time of the fight for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence linked to race, color, religion, origin and now sex.
Twitter changes its platform and is more similar to Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter introduced Monday changes in the presentation of his platform, to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which is like a little more than Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another "name" to follow more legibly online, the activity of other "Twittos," which follows the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows whether they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have messages favorites, etc.
This new formula Twitter has been tested on a small percentage of users in August "to be broadcast to the whole network Monday, told AFP the door - floor of Twitter, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its functioning little instinctive, with terms somewhat esoteric (RT to pass a message to someone else, # followfriday to recommend to follow another user) doing the happiness insiders, opens to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the public networks Facebook and Google +.
On the network, users debated with "tweets" decided on the interest of this innovation.
"It is unnecessary, invasive, and it looks like too to Facebook," wrote @ jemb123.
"The functionality Activity will help me to better follow some elements of my Twitter stream," wrote @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
recording of a "golden rule" in the constitution
The coalition government of Social Democrat - Christian Democrat in power in Austria decided Tuesday to put in the constitution a "golden rule" budget in order to reduce public deficits and avoid a possible downgrading by rating agencies Austria's sovereign rating (triple A).
It is the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann, who was even announced this decision after a council of ministers, while Austrian public debt is 74.6 percent, well above the - the criterion of 60% maximum set by the Maastricht Treaty, but significantly - below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the solvency of Austria was downgraded one notch, from AAA to AA +, we should pay three billion euros of interests in more each year," said Minister - Christian Democrat Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is following a request from the summit in Brussels of eurozone members of 26 October: the heads of state and government had called for the registration by the end of 2012 the reduction of public deficits and a return to balanced public accounts in the constitution or a law of equal value.
The device adopted by the Austrian government nears the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a rule. "."
By 2017, the structural deficit should decrease each year of 0.75 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and, starting in 2017, the structural deficit of the federal state will not exceed each year 0.35% of GDP, while the regional states and municipalities will present balanced budgets.
The aim is to 2020 / 21 public debt below the 60 percent criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen strong
Noda threat of a new intervention on the foreign exchange market
The Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again on the foreign exchange market if the yen should continue to mount.
"We will intervene as we did the last time we see excessive volatility" in yen exchange rate, said Mr Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was not far from the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
This day, Tokyo has sold heavily yen against the dollar to lower the value of the Japanese currency which had set a new record of force since 1945 against the greenback.
But the yen is regularly picked up since, boosted by purchases of investors who see it as a "safe haven" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar rose Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen, close to the levels that sparked the last speech.
Before the financial crisis of 2008 - 2009, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge of the Japanese currency hurt exports of the archipelago because it said the cost of products Made in Japan and reduced the value of income from abroad by Japanese firms, when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan fight to rebuild" since the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, which devastated the area of the northern Tohoku - is), Mr Noda said that fears that the rising yen kills in the bud the fragile recovery.
The third global economic power has reconnected with growth in the third quarter - 1.5 percent from the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound of exports and household consumption June by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister said that the high yen did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan.".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened Tuesday a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BOJ had already taken "appropriate measures", suggesting that no additional monetary easing was expected Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the rose 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) its purchases of Treasuries, to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling amounts it devotes to financial securities purchases to flood the market liquidity.
Eurozone:
rates go up, the flanchent stock
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis undermines the European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, rates of the countries affected continue their ascent.
Also worried for the stability of the euro zone, European stock markets are a little more in negative territory on Tuesday November 15.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4 percent to 3.064 points.
The DAX in Frankfurt and London give 0.4% 0.1%.
"With the new tensions on the bond yields of euro area states in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains.".
"Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," said Terry Pratt, institutional trader at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7 percent, with his round of renewed fears of market stakeholders about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, is riveted on Europe and the trade in a narrow corridor of variations as investors will not be evidence that the situation is stabilized," said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed worries about the future of the eurozone penalises the single currency, which continues its decline Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level since a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European currency is 1,3570 dollar, falling 0.4%.
According to brokers, it fell after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, met in congress passed a motion on Monday, including the possibility for a country struggling to get out of the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates well beyond 6%
The borrowing rate of Italy and Spain remain at levels very worrying.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85 percent, the same Spanish securities mature 6.2%.
These tensions on interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to stoke fears of speakers.
The head of the Italian government Mario Monti called time markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the sights of markets, while parliamentary elections held Sunday in the country.
The rate gap ("spread") between the obligations to 10 years in Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
In the expectation growth figures the euro zone
The statistics, France has recorded economic growth of 0.4 percent in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3 percent expected, brought by household consumption.
The Insee, revised down the figure of the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
And, it really is the fourth most concerned about the economists.
Germany, meanwhile, has registered a growth of 0.5 percent over the same period.
A first estimate for the whole euro area is expected at 11am, while the European Commission warn against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts should prevail on the dogmas
If it is a subject that we cannot treat from short-term considerations or under the "emotion, it is the energy policy.
The availability and cost of the electricity directly affect purchasing power and on the competitiveness of businesses.
It is healthy that an election date is the opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place that is nuclear.
The debate will only be successful if he explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet ", the" demographic changes will lead to a doubling of demand for electricity by 2050, at least to deprive a huge part of the global population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will have to overcome the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce the electricity, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a subject disappeared from the debate.
The Fukushima accident does none of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in his decision to give up nuclear weapons.
This is the case of Belgium, who submitted his to the need to find a replacement source can replace, or Switzerland, which is just not build the latest generation plants.
Conversely, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, for example, continue their projects with determination.
The United States have decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park in the construction of a plant suspended after the accident at Three Mile Island.
If the German model, focused on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality frustrates the speech.
The choice of Berlin will be translated by the rise in the price of electricity the energy dependence, a worsened by the increasing reliance on imported gas, especially Russia, a jump of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas plants and to coal.
In a few months, all of these unfortunate effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is to ponder.
Champion of Europe of the wind, "which he gets 30 percent of its electricity, it is also one of the biggest users of coal and gas because of the intermittency of wind; under what, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Conversely, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill of more than 40 percent of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of the energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industrial tool on the national territory, French companies enjoy the cheapest electricity in Europe.
In fact, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would create a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would make illusory fine statements on the redevelopment of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially as they are not opposed in principle to this energy, polls show.
Remember that the energy policy of our country has helped build an industrial sector 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 induced jobs.
Heavily export, it causes a galaxy of SMEs specializing on international markets and makes them very creative non-relocatable jobs.
If France were to decide to get out of nuclear power, this would sacrifice many of these SMEs in reducing alarmingly 6 billion annual French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician ordered an EPR designed to operate 60 years while the decline of its manufacturer would be scheduled?
To solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no source of electricity production of miracle, as there is diabolical.
The development by Areva solutions CO2 emitting little, nuclear and renewable, shows the complementarity of sources of energy. "
For the nuclear, maintain the highest level of security is an absolute imperative.
We have a safety authority in France, which has control intransigent and transparent on existing plants as on the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited the same obsession with security.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents.
A single, Three Mile Island, intervened in normal operating conditions; it remained without consequence human or environmental.
At Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human error caused the tragedy.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn the lessons of this accident, as it did for the previous two.
The product of this approach and cooperation between security authorities, operators and the French and German manufacturers, the PRT presents a design making it able to resist such phenomena.
So it is considered by all the electricians eager to build a plant, the judgment of its construction at Flamanville would be a wonderful gift to competitors of Areva and EDF in their leaving the way free to grab the leadership in the development of nuclear power.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to leave the "emotion, dogmas and partisan tactics dominate a debate as crucial to the economic, financial and social situation of our country.
The immigration is a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized in various ways - congestion of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status "human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who made the news, the interior minister (read Liberation of 23 May) proclaiming that France "did not need foreign talent, builders and restaurant servers.".
But it is rarely analysed in economic terms.
It is there on this issue a fairly broad consensus between left and right.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who said in 1976 that "¥900 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million migrant workers," and left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left and right.
For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden for the economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that we are prepared to pay towards immigrants.
In its programme, Francois Hollande is restricted to platitudes, indicating that the co-development will solve our "migration problem.".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, is perhaps going off; but it is economically very costly.
As the recall economists and Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book summarising the latest knowledge on immigration (: How Migration Shaped orphans of Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among the experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that receive immigrants.
Restricting immigration anemia growth and employment.
The fears of the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may substitute for national workers, particularly the low-skilled, exerting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary that substitutes for national employees, for most of the jobs in sectors in shortage of employment.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which the training is not following the offer of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will have trouble working in a country that has a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants are that the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% rise of migratory flows increase between 0.6 and 0.9% in real wages in the long term.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to economic growth (high proportion of immigrants naturalized among American Nobel; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The migrants also are net contributors of social systems, an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organisation estimated that, in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 years will make a net contribution (revenue less expenses) of 150,000 euros public budgets on average over the whole of his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to, at the start of the mandate, go look for the missing growth "with teeth.".
The teeth, to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, remains to think European democracy
Democracy is a precious commodity; it is also a very fragile.
The European continent should remember him for having invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, has known throughout the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, colonels in Greece.
Some were able to believe that it would be enough for democracy triomphât definitively of its enemies, to exercise the vote, and the exercise in the most direct way.
We know, since Napoleon "Little," it was a facility of thought.
The universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and may even be "instrument of oppression" as once the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation of powers and control, education, enlightenment, solidarity, economic and social justice.
The crisis in Europe that we live in is an economic crisis, but it is equally and a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinodie faked the Greek referendum will have to double value: the need for a return of powerful political, but also the disquieting sense of his impossibility, its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be outdated.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle today are displaced, and that, for many of them, the soldiers Republicans do more in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to demand a succession of national referendums, organised the needs and dispersed.
A white sheet - European absolute monarch or a leap to empty in the nationalist withdrawal: what choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cut-off but a common exercise of calm and continuous, the choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There was no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - cannot be more where stop the list - because there is a crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, which bends to the dictates of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe who is humiliated on the international stage.
It is concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but the whole of Europe who slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The emergency is to restore the popular sovereignty flying of the European project.
Because it is whole, Europeans can reduce the weight of their debts, free markets and prepare for the future in investing.
The crisis exit will involve decisions at European level which can be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After long fought this proposal socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is asking for European economic government.
Either.
But think without a democratic political integration and stronger, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must assume a new stage of European integration.
To make the Republic in France, it took "do" of Republicans.
The Revolution in the interests could not be sufficient.
That lesson remains valid.
We must build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe politically, a genuine European popular sovereignty.
In Europe, are Europeans.
The smart cards "without contact" spreading
The trade show the chip card opens Tuesday at 100-point, near Paris, in a climate optimistic.
The year 2011 should be complete on an 11% increase global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with a SIM card...), more than 6 billion units, according Eurosmart.
The most promising technology is that without contact which helps pay the transport or settle its purchases in approaching the card from a reader.
This year, 460 million smart cards without contact should be sold around the world, against 320 million a year earlier.
Their share should still progress in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the global market of the smart card (6,925 million cards).
Long the laggard of the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But the supermarkets.
Carrefour has issued this year and 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
To move up a gear, it must now that banks equip their customers.
"Two big French institutions are committed to broadcast to the future of their customers' bank cards equipped for without contact," said Gerard Nébouy, director general Visa Europe France.
The banks are testing the payment by mobile
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few aircraft are now equipped with NFC technology (Near Field Communication) necessary to conduct transactions.
"They have fallen behind.".
"But they should finally have a real growth next year.".
"We are counting on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 in the world," said Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But banks take the lead.
The Credit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June to Caen.
The iPhone of some 200 customers and staff will be equipped with a holster authorizing the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Societe Generale, too, said yesterday prepare the marketing of an offer to allow its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From the Sahara in Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing, the ties between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Foreign Affairs Minister, Abdelkader Messahel, has even said that Algiers has now "satisfied.".
"The way the two organisations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is cooperation," he said without elaborating.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger in January would have uncovered.
Kidnappés in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of AQIM, Antoine Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time that several of their abductors during an operation by French special forces.
In the rubble of the speech, the Nigerien and French investigators to trace several phone chip belonging to terrorists.
Axis terrorist
The analysis of past calls to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are particularly interested investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has travelled extensively in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram and the other to a man who is close to AQIM and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but it should probably expect more formal evidence before talk of operational cooperation between AQIM and Boko Haram.".
"But it is possible.".
"We know for years that the sect enjoys financial support and external intellectuals and that she is increasingly active," said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "support" had been increasingly evident in the development and speeches of Boko Haram or operating methods, which involve the use of suicide bombers or explosives increasingly complex and even invoice as those used by AQIM.
The international community, to begin by Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long viewed the group as a community of visionaries little worthy of interest.
A rapid success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram haoussa - which means "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in Muslim northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has a rapid success.
It is politicizing and requires a strict observance of Sharia law while its militants committed the fight against the central government impious.
They aim of all churches, bars, authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants are particularly active, multiplying attacks against police stations.
The reaction of Abuja is, as usual, without nuance.
The military invests the city, there are 800 people.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
Therefore the sect will radicalise and leave his northern strongholds.
At last Christmas, she claims an attack that left 80 people dead in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it is still in Abuja that Boko Haram has secured police headquarters in a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be his first target.
The creation of a terrorist axis operating in Africa Mauritania to Somalia from Nigeria now anxious all security specialists.
So that AQIM has invested Mali and Niger, that Somalis of al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppe warned against Boko Haram and is ready "to share all information.".
The world according to the Republican candidates for the presidency
On China, Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry vying to oversimplification and ignorance.
A America weakened by the crisis can manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
To listen to the Republican presidential candidates, voters may believe.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other multiplying thundering declarations and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strong point.
On China, Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often not supported - mounts.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the race for the nomination of the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and the challenge "for manipulation of their currency," a theme porter in an America exasperated by the migration of swathes of its industry to Asia.
Too bad if it must involve the outbreak of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama in China and only candidate to have a vision of sophisticated foreign policy, has failed to strangle face an attitude that "gloat" emotions.
He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, which is in the depths of the polls, is inaudible.
In the image of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran, he fanfaronné."
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in its obligations to the partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second candidate, it was an embarrassing lack of records.
Recently, he called to counter the military threat China because Beijing "is trying to develop a nuclear capability" - apparently ignoring the fact that China holds the military atom since 1964.
The Texas governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strikes against Iran, is ready to commit to the U.S. military in Mexico against the drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and Michele Bachmann.
It is far from the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president counter that Reagan also had simple ideas and he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and he had to put water in his wine in counterterrorism.
They insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the departure too rushed "boys" in Iraq, his dithering in Libya, sticky label him as weak.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population judge rather positive assessment of national security to Obama, who has eliminated Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it is wary of military interventions that lead to deadlock.
And, arguing that it must rebuild economically America to resurrect his leadership, Obama hits.
The North Stream, new gateway for Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, directly linking Western Europe to Russia from the bottom of the Baltic Sea, came into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with a bang.
More than 500 guests including four Heads of State and Government participated last Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra and smorgasbord end, at the inauguration of the Nord Stream, this new pipeline that connects directly under the sea, Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned the wheel of the valve together commander the entry of Russian gas in the western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1 224 km from the area of St. Petersburg in the Land of Pomerania.
A second tube must be completed by the end of 2012, the total to 55 billion cubic meters of gas, equivalent to the entire French consumption.
And we already mentioned the possibility of building a third on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time for this huge project has the air of victory.
The project had been strongly opposed by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The Nord Stream will enable us to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding land crossing by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose a little of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh in on Russia by threatening to shut down access to European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the North Stream to a "new Molotov-Ribbentrop pact," in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for Poland in 1939.
That is to say if the issue is politically sensitive.
The Western Europe, supporting the Russian proposal, has gained greater security of supply.
But it is the price of a weakening of Europe of energy, since the project has created a rift between Europeans, East and West.
Russia has known, in five years ago, to his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, strongly consumers of gas, and whose deposits are in decline.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically," Fillon said in opening this pipeline, showing how the major gas contracts are also political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles posted by the leaders of Gazprom, present in number to Lubmin, to the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The submarine is in gainé steel tube of concrete to protect against the anchors of ships.
It is based on the bottom of the sea, 200 metres on average.
For the build, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for the North Stream.
He also took measures to protect the flora and fauna.
The tube is a long snake of heavy metal, as 242 Eiffel towers, that nothing stops on its entire length: or valve, or maintenance station.
A platform of control was planned off Sweden, but officials have abandoned the project while the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state company moving permanently off their coasts.
"In case of damage, we stop the passage of gas in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas content in the pipeline escapes in the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by manufacturers who have planned the welds to know a leak every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the state of the pipeline is provided by a robot under - sailor, dragged by a ship for external monitoring, as well as by a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is brought inside the tube, wide a metre in diameter, and it is driven by the gas.
In the end, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 feet a second, precise information on the possible distortions of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate 50 years without any compensation.
The movement of the gas is simply provided by the pressure.
It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 to the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to realize this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which retains a 51% stake.
If there are joined the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as Dutch Gasunie's and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, named Nord Stream, build and operate the pipeline.
She has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this company for 20 years, the entire gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually taken," said Jens Müller.
The funding of the construction of the pipeline has been assured to 30% by shareholders and 70 percent by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has risen to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are safe to return to their expenses, since only Gazprom assumes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coastline pine planted.
Some 4.5 metres tall, valves, form the exit door of gas.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and characteristics of the gas that comes before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas each hour.
At full capacity, this will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine notebook, a mark.
Established about 15 years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine to restore the taste of writing.
It smacks of adventure, hours to write to light a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable with his black rectangular coverage, his elastic, leaves a white colour, as outdated by the time.
Still, the Moleskine notebook as we know today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decides to launch a notebook design but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, the launch of the new product.
The book is based on an ancient technique of production, the mole skin (skin of mole) which means a cotton veneer used to cover benches by example.
This type of notebook was very popular writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has returned to the fore a subject old and forgotten, that was an icon of the avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," said Maria Sebregondi, since the head of the mark in Modo Modo.
The success is.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose 26 percent to 12.7 million pieces.
It is far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3 000 books were designed.
Moleskine transcends borders Italian and exported in 70 countries, France until the United States.
It is difficult to establish a sketch of the buyer, because the notebook seduced both the businessman that the student and professionals.
In the image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its infancy, has almost 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its books in the bookshops, the Internet to small shops in downtown and was able to impose its identity.
"We have followed the air time and this new writing, despite the rise of e-mail," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signing with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects and artists put their own book.
In August, it has also launched a leopard, coverage at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this will be cultural, Moleskine has managed to diversify its products: bags, agenda, pens, covers of computer... The brand is on a whole range of mediums.
A success that was envied: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why the unemployment rate for disabled workers remains so high?
About 19 percent of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled opens today.
Despite a proactive policy implementation in 2005, the unemployment rate of disabled people is still more than twice the average: 19% versus 9% for the whole population.
Décourageant?
"No, said Eric Blanchet, director general of the Adapt, the association which organises the week for the employment of disabled."
"The progress made since 15 years are considerable."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"It is still a great deal to do."
It must be said that for the unemployed disabled, the many obstacles remain before access to employment.
They are aged: 37 percent have more than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80 percent do not have the box and on the 2.3 million students in higher education, 10 000 only are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, against 38% on average.
In short, all of which criteria hampering the return to employment, and which "are the crux of the problem," said Christian Grapin, director general of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
That is for the brakes objectives.
The unspoken, attitudes are changing, but too slowly.
A study in April by the association IMS - Entreprendre for the City indicated that managers surveyed "a low level of knowledge of disability," with a "over-representation of people in wheelchairs, intellectual or psychological functioning.".
As a result, private companies of more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the goal of employment 6% of disabled workers, set in a law... 1987.
The latest figures available, which date back to 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3 percent," said Pierre Blanc, director general of the Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with the law.
The evidence: the number of institutions "taxed", as the amounts paid, declined between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 46 000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros).
"The law of 2005, which increased contributions, has created a pressure on companies," said Pierre White.
"But this improvement also reflected a real awareness, especially in the big groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 percent of the establishments of 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, against 82 percent of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What happiness"
Before face the Blues on Tuesday night (7) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that makes this friendly match.
It will not go up to write that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side-by-side on the stage of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace.
Five months after the gesture of mood of striker against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise.

Without fail, however, the concept of "fun".
France, he has encouraged since age 7 and the victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I was always bear," he said.
Without any doubt, it contributes to further strengthen the character "of this meeting."
Moreover, in the face, "Mathieu Debuchy (), Yohan Cabaye () and Adil Rami ()," he said.
"It is crossed."
"To play against them, it is that of happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens has mentioned the "pride".
"Pride" play "a gala match.".
"Pride" also see - as "neighbour" - France "is now a team of very high level" a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has made a work of thunder," he said.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be well share the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our small Belgians are great," he said.
"We are building something, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"You will during the next few matches." Anyone against France included.
Portugal very confident
Portugal's Paulo Bento begins with a lot of optimistic his dam return to Bosnia (2200) on Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the go, both teams had been realistic.
"At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a country happy.".
Paulo Bento is already sees, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, it is not the shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, which it is the levers since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is 90 minutes of happiness.
But there was a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to unseat.
In view of the game go (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems clear that the games are not facts.
Portugal has dominated the party for more than an hour, but he was unable to score that goal so valuable, that would have relieved.
"This is a good result, which contains a certain risk because we have not scored a goal outside"
But at home, in their luminous Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to move to a public which should also be steaming, even if the party is "very close" course, Walgreen a Bento optimistic but lucid.
"We expect a very tight game, but we are quite convinced to take over," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of being at the Euro 2012", has played down the successor to Carlos Queiroz.
The no reported Friday of Bosnia requires the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw may be enough to the Bosnians, who have also need to score.
"This is a good result, which contains a certain risk because we have not scored a goal to the outside," said Bento.
"We will play against a team that has a lot of technical skills and which has players with great individual qualities," he added.
As to Zenica, the Portuguese have the intention to put a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to not "give them time to reflect."
A good idea, provided to be realistic, this time.
