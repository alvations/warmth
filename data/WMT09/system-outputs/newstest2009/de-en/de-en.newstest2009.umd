a bloodbath American shares 
The US House of Representatives has rejected a plan to support the financial system on Monday, for up to $700 billion (almost 12 billion K) should be spent. 
The legislators ignored the request by President George Bush, to support the plan. 
Bush's view, the plan would be the fundamental causes of the financial crisis rules and thus help to stabilise the economy as a whole. 
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the major stock indexes recorded the biggest drop in more than 20 years. 
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, a similar collapse had he last in 1987.

Congress concession: US-government must borrow $700 billion in banks 
The leader of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush, on a broader form of an agreement on financial aid for the American financial system. 
is to be voted on at the beginning of next week. 
The US legislators reached in talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the American financial system for a total of $700 billion (approximately 12 billion crowns) a breakthrough. 
However, this is no victory. 
The Congress must still negotiate details of the agreement, before you publish the final version of the law and cannot vote. 
The plan to support the financial system on Monday in the US Congress. 
on Sunday said that the chairman of the committee on banking and financial services Barney Frank of the Reuters news agency. 
The Senate could different according to probably be voted on the plan on Wednesday at the earliest. 
According to economists, a communication that the plan is adopted, the first significant psychological factor for a revival of the financial markets. 
However, it then come to a "Disillusion" because of the complex mechanisms, as the markets could also help in practice. 
Paulson: the plan must be effective 
"We have made significant progress. 
We have clarified our different views, as a package to stabilise the market should be ", said on the agency Bloomberg Democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
their words suggest that it could come to a final vote on Sunday. 
Representatives of the legislators met in the night of Sunday with the American Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, in order to give the government fund its final form. 
This is a Abkauf Unverkäuflicher mortgage assets from financial companies, the financial firms in heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system. 
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan to work and the effect on the market. 
We must continue the regeneration plan, but I think we are getting close, "Paulson. 
a signal for Asia Business 
The global financial crisis is also clear, the sharp fall in the stock markets. 
The words of the Democratic senator from Nevada, Harry Reid, according to are the legislators, before Sunday in Congress to reach a final agreement. 
that if you want to reassure investors before shops on the Asian financial markets, the first time zone, where a decision of Congress could influence the business on Monday. 
So far, but is not yet clear when both chambers of the US Congress will vote on the law, also last-minute confusion over whether the negotiations could not fail but still a problem. 
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days. 
But the law is even some changes. 
The aid for the system certain total should be divided into two parts. 
The initial $350 billion should be as quickly as possible, as President George Bush called. 
However, the Congress can block the distribution of the remaining money, if he has the impression that the programme is not fulfilled its function, and another $100 billion, and later the final $350 billion. 
Bush sees progress in negotiations positive 
The president has a veto in relation to this decision, however, Congress can veto. 
However, despite these changes is the idea of the programme remained there, based on finances for the Abkauf bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen to win, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer in a position to repay their mortgages. 
"We have prepared everything. 
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, then the Senate on Monday, "the Republican Senator Judd Gregg. 
It is satisfied with the progress the American President Bush. 
spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was satisfied with the progress on Saturday and "appreciate the mutual efforts to protect to stabilize our financial markets and our economy". 
limiting Golden Fallschirme 
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiators, said, the legislators have a responsibility for the money programme to protect taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of perks and a timetable for the financing of the plan. 
The new law will also restrict the so-called Golden Fallschirme for directors of companies that are involved in the programme and a committee, which is to the supervision of the fund. 
This is the Ministry of Finance. 
"We have worked very hard and achieved a major step towards agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," Paulson. 
The plan also expects with aid for homeowners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage. 
The government should negotiate new rates for mortgages it buys, with the aim to reduce monthly cost for the debtor and enable it to them to keep their homes. 
Marek: psychological help 
The proposed plan after the main economist David Marek of Patria finance is a good idea, but the implementation will be very difficult. 
"And therefore, because we do not know, through the mechanism and at what price the troubled assets bought up. 
This will be crucial, as the financial sector and the government each year, "said Marek the losses this week the server Ihned.cz. 
If the plan is adopted now or the beginning of next week, after Mareks view is not crucial. 
"It is much more important that the Congress members agree to support and adopt him as quickly as possible. 
The psychological importance of agreement that there is an adoption is at this moment the most important, "said Marek. 
duel on a knife edge: MP3-player against mobile phones. 
we discussed it in your election 
While nearly every mobile phone MP3 files can take place, is still not MP3 player phone. 
It is, of course, that it is better to buy only a telephone. 
Despite everything, there is plenty of reasons why we should create an independent player. 
The election is the kind of use and the demands of the future owner. 
Buy it is difficult for a brilliant expensive plates at home, in order to listen to the latest album From Maxim Turbulenc. 
The first such musical new do not seem to LPs, and qualitative view there is no objective reason for it. 
However, they have LPs with kind of rock, Jazz or Blues on the shelf, dream you probably at least of such. 
So it is with the music on travel, with condensed music, simple-music in the MP3 format. 
here too there is price and quality categories. 
Perhaps it is not acceptable for one, for a player to spend eight Kroner, but is also a Pink Floyd-fan unlikely headphones for 20 Kroner from the market cope. 
two extremes, between those there is enough room for everyone. 
The selection is diverse. 
The life of the battery is crucial. 
Some good music player can do a lot more than just music playing, but what phones can you not even hints. 
No modern equipment is so universal as the telephone. 
In addition to the primary functions, the phones and Sim Sen, music and videos, both, it has a better time to have a worse photo and can perhaps also navigate. 
and if the Smartphons and communicators, almost a small computer in the pocket. 
It is a small miracle, because no fridge can crickets and no television pictures. 
But the universality of mobile phones also disadvantages. 
The more you to use your mobile phone, the more often you will have to invite, however,. 
and the place of music is one of the largest energy savings. 
Only a few phones can music longer than ten-place 12 hours, mostly it is much less. 
In this regard, music player (easiest) clearly more efficient. 
You should count in the cheap mobile phones that they no longer than a few hours of music playing. 
If they then and still buy they preferred to security or a loading equipment for office-that also applies to more expensive equipment. 
In MP3 players, they do not have this problem, the less good at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with a time loading. 
Another problem is, if you want to play the music on mobile phone on. 
Unfortunately, only a small part of the equipment on a USB-conclusion, also is not every mobile phone without special software directly to a PC. 
of course, the music directly to a storage medium on play, but only a few card reading equipment without reduction deal with the tiny storage cards, which are used in mobile phones. 
players they need to exceptions (iPod) no special software. 
They need the device only on USB-port to feed with music from your PC. 
Most mobile phones and player, a music library, formed after the name of the performers, the title of the albums, the gender or the assessment by users, for example. 
Some devices are only the tree structure of the lists of addresses list, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (Iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system). 
players are easier to use mobile phones can be more 
The selection of a specific equipment, particularly after the lifespan of Akkus, the storage capacity, the quality and type of Klangs and, of course, ask the operator of comfort. 
Music is all aid and hear them only briefly in the trams, then, for example, every day is any mobile phone, the MP3 files. 
What can really almost every mobile phone. 
They must also not very monitor what music formats, a mobile phone or a player can process. 
MP3 create all, and most of the music they get, is precisely in this format. 
The format is one of the most popular and most equipment can also music in Wma format. 
less is usual AAC (a format that Apple and its use iPods). 
better phones will also be buying music online. 
One need only on mobile Internet the sides of providers (or any other service), and you can buy a song or album. 
This service can already and for a striking argument for why we should create a music mobile. 
Unfortunately, the supply of providers bad and are usually confined to rapid Radiohits. 
Prices are also not the lowest. 
But the assumption is that this type of sales of music (on GSM, Internet and wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future. 
The mobile phone, most in. 
If you want to listen to something, you after the mobile phone in the expected, while the player at home. 
However, it is important, whether they are headphones or at least a wireless free speech in themselves. 
If not, you can at the integrated resort loudspeakers, almost every mobile phone, but only a few MP3 player. 
Probably the greatest benefit of music phones for many in the price. 
The cheapest cost usually less than three thousand Kronor. 
for three-and four crowns, they have a very decent Walkmans. 
The biggest handicap for the most that are not normal headphones. 
the best and most technologically sophisticated phones with a 3.5-mm-opening for normal headphones costs up to fifteen thousand Kronor. 
the advantage of the player is the easy service. 
The simplest-and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really use each. 
A minimum of functions, the similarity in service with the normal Kassettenrekorder earlier or record players, for example, is obvious. 
There is no conflict in the form of mobile Internet mistakenly employees and then horrendous bill for data transfers. 
The equipment we should now resort 
The cheapest mobile phones (such as Vodafone 527) are generally on a slot for exchange storage media (type M2, Microsd, etc.). 
Even if the card to buy, two crowns. 
But respect. 
The base models are usually only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB supported. 
Only the most expensive can 8-GB memory cards read. 
if you already have a mobile phone and wanted to buy a cheap MP3 player, then pick up after Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver. 
depending on the capacity (Max. 2 GB) then they should not more than 1100 Kronor on the table. 
They are demanding listeners, they prefer specialized phones-Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have independent Bedienknöpfe comfort for MP3, and the work is so in a individual MP3 players. 
Most is Sony Ericsson, the mobile phones of the series Walkmans the same user interface as the MP3 players sold individually. 
The same services in the same price category of up to four crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours maximum) make you MP3-player of the aforementioned manufacturers. 
The first virtual providers is already in this year after the Czech Republic. 
Perhaps 
The mobile market is mature in the Czech Republic, Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they offered by its partners in western Europe. 
still missing something here-a virtual providers, the classic to lower prices. 
Perhaps this will not long to wait. 
The Czech mobile phone operators to the most expensive in Europe at work, we have often on mobile.cz reported. 
It also confirmed the telecommunications authority tú, the attention that the price of a text messages is higher here than in the rest of the European Union. 
According to the latest steps taken by the European Commission in regulation of roaming charges it is probably to a paradoxical situation for some customers of the Czech mobile telephone text messages from cheaper abroad than at home. 
How is it that the prices are so high in the Czech Republic compared with Europe? 
The answer is simple, there is no competition, the really a challenge. 
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, there are three mobile phone networks in the Czech Republic and a penetration of far more than 100%. 
The mobile phone providers rant against like that there is very much competition on the Czech market. 
The often agrees, the chairman of the Council of the Czech telecommunications authority (TÚ) Pavel Dvoák, in, often said in the past that there is no place for another supplier in the Czech Republic. 
It is likely that a classic providers with their own network has not so many opportunities (and he would probably also almost frequencies). 
But there is still a possibility-a virtual providers. 
The entry of virtual service providers in the mobile phone market, a significant price reduction, on which the traditional mobile operators had to respond. 
There were before the advent of such firms such as Tesco mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in Britain, similar in the Czech Republic. 
But it has shown that there is room for such providers and that this can be successful. 
Moreover, it does not take long to find examples. 
In February of this we have on the launch of the virtual mobile provider King in Poland. 
in just half a year, this providers, to win more than 100 thousand customers and so the five biggest supplier of the country. 
Mobile King is the financial group Penta in Czech Republic including submarines: FON. 
The advantage of virtual suppliers is that we can concentrate on a much more specific target. 
in order to be able to function effectively, need virtual service providers are much less customers as a classic providers. 
You need a relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. 
in the world, the virtual providers normally as a low-cost companies-they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, which often accompanied by a less extensive service. 
for example, Tesco mobile in Britain SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors. 
However, as the example of mobile King in Poland, it can also be a very good move, a Klischeehafte target. 
Those suppliers is specifically aimed at men. 
"Real Kerle choose mobile King-the providers, you like and they can trust", as David is, the CEO of the mobile entertainment company, the company this virtual supplier. 
It's hard to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could foothold in the Czech Republic. 
Doubts also Vodafone's press officer Miroslav epický: "the Czech market for a market segment, based on the most virtual operators, relatively small. 
It is also relatively saturated from the point of view of the services. " 
In the Czech Republic chance, my mobile phone operators 
But it is almost certain that, if a virtual mobile providers conquered Czech Republic, this will not be mobile King. 
"We talk about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic, the negotiations were not very hopeful. 
There will be more to a market entry of mobile King in other countries in our region ", says in a telephone conversation for mobile.cz Jana Studniková, press the financial group Penta spokeswoman. 
indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile provider in the Czech Republic this idea not biased. 
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor. 
their interest in a launch of a virtual mobile provider shows the GTS Novera group for some time, the one step further, a real competitor from Telefónica O2 in wholesale. 
"We have a great interest in our customers not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services. 
and the sooner, the better. 
This opportunity we have negotiated with all Czech mobile operators. repeatedly 
with some of them we have already negotiating progress ", the group's press spokesman Pavel Kaidl. 
Perhaps now better times. 
No official information shows that the first virtual providers may be expected by the end of the year. 
But this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence. 
"At the moment we do not assume that exists in the Czech Republic for a full virtual service providers. 
the Czech market, to other markets specifics. 
so far has no entity with a complex and serious project in this area ", says in his statement for mobile.cz Vlastimil Sre from the press department Telefónica O2. 
on the nature of the Czech market, other providers. 
The press from T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the declaration of O2 added: "So far, we have not yet viable and mutually advantageous project found that we could build." 
It adds: "the network of T-Mobile until the end of the year is hardly a virtual service providers. 
At this moment we should already have a concrete offer before, to think so in the short term. " 
Vodafone directed his attention more to meet the requirements of its 3G licence. 
Miroslav epický says: "We are open for negotiations with potential virtual providers, in particular in the area of division of costs and infrastructure. 
This is what we see as the best from the point of view of the customers. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is in search of a partner to create a shared network for a rapid mobile Internet. " 
The authorities-with the suppliers hand-in-hand 
Mobile phone operators is easy to understand another providers would be more competition, this would lower prices and also lead to a decline in profits. 
So why should we facilitate such a competitors entering the market? 
The providers can pull together, when it comes to something, shows the long and talking about the emergence of submarines: FON. 
Probably the strongest pressure in the direction of the tú was at the time when U: Fon on the market, from T-Mobile society. 
The show also publicly accessible information from the tú websites. 
Now lends itself, submarines: Fon as argument why we should not allow a virtual service providers. 
Martina Kemrová said: "the competition environment of the mobile phone market was also recently by the market entry of a fourth mobile provider. 
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player in the market, and particularly its services would high demands. " 
Given this approach of cell phone providers surprised but the absolute lack of Czech regulators. 
It is not only about the attitude of the tú in Czech, unfortunately, unlike Britain and other developed countries-not the competence to intervene in the economic competition. 
This is only the Office for the Protection of economic competition (Úohs). 
But this referred to this whole issue its typical attitude. 
"The market of a virtual mobile provider would be possible after a contract between a mobile phone providers and a virtual providers on the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. 
To date, there has been no such contracts, because the potential interested bid was probably not sufficient for the traditional operators interesting ", in response to our question Kristián Chalupa of the foreign relations department of the Úohs. 
Representatives of the supplier would not surprise. 
an authority, representing the interests of consumers, among other things, to ensure that no one abused its market position, this is more than worrying. 
especially if Kristián Chalupa added: "abroad, where virtual providers are normal, is that its market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services." 
But the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and not a price reduction to the interests of the Úohs. 
In this case is truly shocking almost touching the line of the three mobile phone operators, the result from their reactions. 
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence, is obvious. 
Just as the absolutely same petrol price at the pumps is only coincidence and the result of tough competition. 
"The authority has discovered no evidence in this matter to an action against the competition, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter. 
None of the supplier has a dominant market position, so he has not increased responsibility for his actions on the market. 
the necessary tools for the opening up of the mobile phone market for virtual absence probably also the regulatory authority for telecommunications providers ", in its statement. Chalupa 
The interpretation of a dominant position on the market is one of the many points. 
There are, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the tú, after the telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is a single market. 
In such a market, then, of course, none of the Czech mobile phone operators in a dominant position. 
But some legal experts offer a different perspective-for entry of a virtual supplier is always require approval by the network operator. 
and the mobile phone operators, - logically-for its network the monopoly. 
which means that he in a certain segment is necessarily a dominant position. 
Even if not being with this argument, it should be a warning for the Úohs striking resemblance to that three mobile phone operators. 
The show complaints a number of interested parties (including the GTS Novera mentioned society) that negotiations with all providers in very similar obstacles. 
The shifting of responsibility in the tú is a common trick the telecommunications services, with the Úohs distanced itself from the whole affair. 
This was observed in a number of similar cases. 
Unfortunately, it is not possible to the recently adopted changed the telecommunications law enlarging the powers of the tú in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts have promised an improvement of the situation. 
The representatives of the Úohs must know only too well, but they have other interests. probably 
It is, if nobody watching 
Unseen once the functioning of any pseudo-virtual service providers, which in the Czech mobile networks several. 
There are companies that own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but only part public. 
It is usually the firms operating in multi-level marketing. 
mobile telephone services for Amway Bohemia Telecom, Star life and others. 
The price lists these firms are normally only selected. 
the joke of the matter is that the company against the operators as a classical firms customer, a large number of SIM cards. 
As an important customer, he then special price offers (and other offers). 
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile phone providers a similar sale ban. 
"Should there be cases that you describe, then it is a violation of the contractual conditions, where we are then, which brought an end to cooperation with the relevant society", said Martina Kemrová to our question on this issue. 
It is quite unlikely, however, that so something on the leaders of the mobile phone operators not spread. 
particularly in the case of the three companies mentioned, to thousands of customers. 
But no operator opposes such an approach. 
The activity of these firms go to you is not negligible gains, at the same time, they will-unlike the real virtual providers-not be affected by the official marketing. 
potential problems, Miroslav epický ATTENTION: "the law enabling these types of speculation, despite the services of these firms used only a very small percentage of customers. 
They must also accept that the SIM card in your phone is not in your name, you cannot fully on as normal customers mobile providers. " 
But this should tú alone at least strange. 
Besides another question for the Úohs. 
The mobile phone operators such an approach the eyes, why block against a virtual providers? 
It added that the Úohs has fairly strong powers to uncover such activities, and if it does not, it must not with the declaration of providers, they know nothing and their business conditions would ban this satisfied. 
when the Czech Republic is no longer most expensive 
As has been said repeatedly in the text, the market entry virtual providers a sharp price drop in the various services. 
Virtually all countries, where virtual operators, the traditional operators tried, which virtually to prevent more or less. 
The arguments were virtually identical they use-a small, or too much Gesättigter market, problems with the quality of services. 
in advanced countries but attacks in these moments the regulators, not the interests of the mobile phone operators, but tried to maintain their customers. 
whether through formal or informal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operators, and this followed further. 
Unfortunately, throwing the Czech regulators the whole case as a hot potato. 
based on our experience we can not get rid of that confusion in the competence in these cases more than good. 
But we do not throw the towel in grain. 
If the background information and soon a virtual operators, the Czech mobile phone market may soon be moving again. 
If a supplier to the emergence of a virtual mobile provider, the Úohs will not sit idly by when it comes to other interested reject (to discriminate against). 
and the Czechs are finally no longer expensive phones than the rest of Europe.

the Sudeten Germans demanded a referendum by the United States 
the Sudeten Germans had in 1945 to the incorporation of Bohemian forest to the United States. 
This is from a letter, in the collections of south Bohemia scientific library. 
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least under the auspices of the United States of America. 
With such a desire to 1945 some groups of Sudeten Germans have contacted the US president. 
This is from a letter which has been preserved in a private archive and today in the collections of the South Bohemian kept scientific library. 
The German ask Krumau in the letter the American president that he should the return of the "Sudetengaus" - on the basis of the Munich agreement was adopted by Adolf Hitler-cannot afford to Czechoslovakia. 
"We have understood the situation and want to really be sure of the words that the American units not oppressors and enemies on German territory, but as liberators", says in a letter, with the words "people, which the fate of Sudeten Germans signed heart". 
Since the end of the Czechoslovakia Sudeten Germans-in knowledge of the Czech national character-suggests that you brutality, recklessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery would expect, ask the author of the letter the American President, for now and forever the rule on the Bohemian. 
"We cannot believe that without regard to the view of a quarter million inhabitants of this area for US foreign state grant, the oppressed minorities and tried to remove and has done nothing of the allied victory", is to read the letter. 
The reason why the author not can sign, is supposedly the fear of revenge hungry "Czech oppressors". 
If the US president have doubts about the affiliation of Bohemian German, is it enough, if it is in the Böhmerwaldgau would initiate a referendum on whether the inhabitants are part of the United States or wish to live under the protection of the United States. 
Though the text of the letter in today's knowledge of the postwar history might sound naive, he, however, according to some witnesses a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans. 
Even if the Bohemian German at least guessed, that their removal from the Republic would negotiate, that only a few of them at all. Such a possibility 
Some waited for the United States and Britain for the Sudeten Germans would negotiate a kind of autonomy. 
Others believed they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia. 
also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, the bud dates. 
He was in the war as Budweiser German in the Navy used in the Baltic Sea. 
When he came at the end of the war in British captivity and brought him in a prisoner of war camp in Holstein, dozens more Bohemian German to him that he should teach you Czech. 
"They believed that when they come home, the Czech would come to pass," Chalupa. 
None of the German prisoners of war, who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, on his view that it on the basis of the ways decrees from the Republic would drive. 
you heard not-then pay! 
An emotional campaign to drivers 
most expensive action to safety on the streets of the Czech history. 
It could be the emotional media campaign which the transport ministry to launch on Wednesday. 
the authority of Prime Minister Ale ebíek promises, that drivers away from dangerous behavior behind the wheel. 
The campaign for 150 million Kroner in television, radio, in the cinema, on the Internet, but also Flyern. 
It is the diverted drivers faster driving and driving under the influence of alcohol. 
and also remind you, voyage Anzugurten. 
The campaign wants especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, not least, talk some professional drivers. 
and what is shown in the spots? 
especially stories of people who appeal to emotions. 
witness the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign. 
you heard not-then pay! 
The words "heard" in large letters on a plate child. 
and in a blood laugh is the word "pay". 
This should mean that you can pay for a moment mistake with their own lives. 
The spots will viewers "shocked" by 2010. 
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where normal images with dramatic photographs of accident victims. 
It promises that the accident figures and reduced the number of deaths on Czech roads. 
The spots were put together by the agency euro Rscg. 
carrot and stick to the drivers 
"for the drivers, the motto the carrot and the stick. 
The carrot means that, if they save time in red, for example. 
The stick is the threat of sanctions or an accident. 
The driver must be reminded of the risk ", the traffic psychologist of the hospital Koán NA Homolce Martin. 
and that is why information campaigns in the press and particularly negative advertising need, the psychologist. 
his opinion, are less effective posters to draw attention to a danger that the drivers. 
"Is it a static table, the warning of a threat, this will probably soon with the environment Verfließen, and the driver, you will no longer take", says Koán. 
Olmert would back almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace. 
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government Ehud Olmert has opted for the return of virtually all areas, which were occupied in 1967, including the bank, east Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if we could close in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria. 
It said in an interview that on Monday by the newspaper Jediot Achronot printed. 
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it is needed, almost all the (occupied) territories back, if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper. 
"We retain a certain percentage of these areas, but we are going to the Palestinians must surrender a similarly high percentage (Israeli territory), because there will be no peace without this", he added. 
He acknowledged that a possible return will include East Jerusalem. 
"Anyone who wants to security in Jerusalem and especially that tractors or bulldozers on its feet roles, as it happened one of my best friends, will have to forgo part of Jerusalem", said Olmert in allusion to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people were injured. 
After words of the prime minister, it will be necessary, a "special solution for the temple Bern and sacred and historical sites', which is on the territory of the old town. 
"Those who want to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city, will need to integrate 270,000 Arabs. 
It will not work ", he reiterated. 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights 
Olmert spoke for a withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel his opinion, an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria. 
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus. 
"My proposal is not, with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights peace", Olmert reiterated. 
"The Syrians know only too well, what they need to do to recover the Golan Heights. 
They will have to relinquish its current relations with Iran; they are on their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement must abandon; they will have to renounce the constant support, the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the Al-khaida terrorist network and the Islamic Jihad (holy war) in Iraq ", became the Prime Minister. 
After the accident, on the bus are stewards illegal? 
The law does not, in a distance coach is not permitted the run around 
In connection with the tragic accident involving a bus society student agency near the Italian Padua raises the question of whether stewards and travellers during the journey in the bus-and running. 
"We wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activities of stewards in breach of the law on the road", the spokesman of the transport ministry Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, in the last week a 22-year-old stewardess died, was the driver of the lorry caused, the path of the bus. thwarted 
The young woman sat in this moment to all accident apart from the driver, at the least safe place in the car, even though she had two other seats still available. 
A bus can also have an accident in the moment or sharply slowing down in the steward of coffee and newspapers from. 
also plays a role, if the bus the vehicle letter is also equipped with Stehplätzen. 
If this is not foreseen in the bus, the travellers. 
long-distance buses from student agency do not have Stehplätze; the director of the company, Radim Janura, against Aktuáln.cz confirmed. 
"We discussed this with the Department, and this has not approved the movement of passengers. First 
Later it back, and we have reached a consensus that the passengers must go to the toilet during the trip, if you have your seat ", he told his position. 
The law makes no steward 
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of stewards-no law describes this role. 
There is, however, no law prohibiting the carriers to provide services. 
The law on the roads have only the concept vehicle crew; the rights and obligations defined it does not ", the spokesman of the ministry Hanzelka clearly adds. 
The director of the Department of Transportation Department vehicles Josef Pokorný, however, believes that the law covers this issue. 
"It is important, whether the bus in the product has Stehplätze. 
This is everything ", he said. 
Buses are divided in city buses, where there are Stehplätze and the maximum speed limits is permitted, local buses with Stehplätzen and a higher speed and distance coaches without Stehplätze with the highest permitted speed and, with safety belts. 
As the plane, says expert 
The Besip expert for traffic safety Jaroslav Hoín seen in the movement of stewards not a fundamental problem on board a bus. 
"In a liquid driving threat of many dangers, the situation is comparable with the service on board an aircraft. 
here, too, is not sure when turbulence and the stewardess, the head. " 
"slowing down but a bus strongly, then, of course, apply the laws of physics. 
As in the city bus or tram. 
The safety of the stewards must resolve the carrier through internal rules ", he says and believes that this issue from the point of view of the law will not be fully resolved. 
Janura is prepared to remove the services 
Student Agency offers the only bus company services of stewards. 
The company employs around 200 people in this role. 
The director also sees their work after the accident as risk prone. 
"As soon as I get the impression that the profession of stewards risk prone, I will remove it. 
Coffee and newspapers can travellers in boarding. 
This would also reduce costs, "he says. 
as interest in the safety of the director of Asiana Alexey Litvin, the lack of stewards in his buses. its society, but only a fraction of lines compared with student agency. 
"We have no stewardesses, we opposed it from the start. 
Sooner or later it with any fatal accident ", he was not quite a year ago for Týden.cz. 
It was an incredible tragedy 
The accident involving a bus lines to Naples was a young stewardess from the region Pilsen suffered, the two years had worked for the society. 
The Slovenian truck was probably without flashing the hard Abgebogen and had the bus journey. 
The driver of the bus tried, by a sharp manoeuvres to avoid, collided with the right front part of the truck. 
The two jobs for the stewards were sold, denies Janura. 
"These places are reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked." 
The firm wants to sue lorry drivers. 
with a compensation for the family of the young woman, the agency will not wait for the court, but expected a financial compensation from the guilty. 
a change in the law? 
not in sight 
a more precise movement of stewards could bring a regulation on board a bus to a team of experts thirty of the transport ministry is already working on a year. 
"This however is still no concrete conclusion. 
buses are not necessarily on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones in the journey ", expert Hoín. 
"The Ministry of Transport, the activities of the stewards as something that could threaten the safety of passengers much," Hanzelka, and control the security of buses in the hands of the police and the health authorities. 
Düsseldorfer hopes to Frankfurt 
The lack of big words in the letter of WestLB-board to the staff of the house. 
a lead of the Düsseldorfer money Institute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank could "the central capital market house of savings-financial group", according to the leaked letter on Monday. 
WestLB would have a "competence block" with sustainable profitability in this business. 
and such a link could be the decisive impetus to further Bündelungen the banking sector. 
It read, if a board in a difficult time act wants to demonstrate. 
because the ailing WestLB is still under tremendous pressure. 
not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for Financial Services Authority, the government of North Rhine-Westphalia country recently made clear that the time urge to find a sustainable solution. 
as any link between the Deka Bank, the savings know customers because of their investments fund, and WestLB is a speech-Frankfurt side for some time. 
Deka-bank-head Franz Waas during the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August to know, in a merger of the house to the Mainzer road with a country Bank, Helaba or of the WestLB, it makes no sense. 
But the board of Deka on half of the country banks and savings associations, instructed the board, with the WestLB talks on common business activities. 
This could be the capital markets business or parts of it. 
The talks, however, says the city, has only just begun. 
Deka Bank, with its 3,000 staff to the one major employers in the city of Frankfurt, is not the first time, when it comes to consolidation in the savings sector. 
in 2003 it for a moment, the Deka-Bank with the country Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba merge. 
This tripartite alliance was nothing. 
Hardly had the plans became public, the Hessische country government against the participation of Helaba is. 
Two other homes were then not each other. 
The country Bank Rhineland-Palatinate instead went to the land bank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart. 
But it has always thought on a combination of Deka-Bank with banks. 
However, Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, against plan games on a cooperation with his house. 
But regardless of seem ready to recognize that a move together the various homes of the public sector is needed. 
Now the state election in Bavaria, could the Bayernlb first a link with the land bank Baden-Württemberg. 
that is not necessarily good news for the Helaba. 
should increase the pressure to further mergers, they are after partner for. 
In the south, it would be only junior partner, despite the financial crisis so far, has infinitely better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
a rapprochement with the West LB, the savings-and Giro Federation Hessen-Thüringen, with 85 percent of Helaba, a stop at the beginning of the year. 
would the North lb. 
These geo-strategic considerations, but only one side. 
On the other, it is the question of how the business models of the various houses each other. 
In June, Merl, the key issue, with the business model will ensure the future ability of banks, was the German savings banks and Giro Association has not been answered. 
In the end, could also dismantling the West LB, but of course there is not liked. 
It is in the letter of the board of the speech, there will be a "total solution" for the house. 
As with a combination of individual units with the Deka-Bank under an umbrella, will show.

sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate 
The German banking system is relatively stable, said Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only in the last week. 
How well that the politicians used the word "relatively" and Einflocht that the German banking sector of the crises will not spared. 
because it is now at the weekend. 
The Munich quoted in the DAX estate funding Hypo Real estate (HRE), by a consortium of German banks, a billion credit to shield themselves from the turbulence in the markets. 
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday, the loan assistance amounted to 35 billion. 
Hypo Real estate should only part of an interest rate denominated, and in use. 
The money, both private and state-owned banks. 
background, losses in subsidiary Depfa. 
The state financial contributors, according to a newspaper report on long-term projects, for which he has money, extremely short refinanced-which now because of distrust in the markets is no longer possible. 
In the first half of 2008 was the bank's cash reserve shrunk by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, the capital ratio was easily from 1.6 to 1.45 percent. 
The current income and net earnings from financial transactions, compared with the period last year had fallen to zero, the proceeds from Zuschreibungen demands and certain securities and the dissolution of reserves in the lending by more than 70 percent to 5 million euro. 
It was only thanks to higher returns from refunds of downstream clearing costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa-group and from the reimbursement rates after tax and the rules of errand for multinational companies, the yield had minus more moderate with around 16 percent. 
The former state financial contributors, after its privatisation in 1990 first with commercial real estate loans Verspekuliert, which were then were eliminated in the Aareal Bank. 
because they earned too little in the traditional state financing, the Depfa then more in infrastructure projects and the funding of community projects private investors and the state committed (private-public partnership, PPP) and international Diversifizierrt. 
The value of the daughter, Hypo Real Estate now write-offs, a "significant material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, is rather vague. 
The fact is that the dividend was removed. 
for 2007 was cut by two-thirds. 
Hypo Real estate is since the Depfa-taking a major state-and infrastructure funding. 
It is more than other institutions of the refinancing in the interbank market, since it has no customer deposits. 
With the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the lending among banks to largely dried up, as banks hoard their liquidity. 
Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part-around 50 billion Euros of credit portfolios of Depfa short-term funds for refinancing. 
Hypo Real Estate, communication is the financing of the group met with credit for the foreseeable future and "the impact of the companies currently failing international money markets largely functioning" protected. 
Other sources say that, thanks to the money was secured the refinancing by the end of 2009. 
The Hre-chairman Georg Funke said that the Hypo Real estate group against the money markets for the foreseeable future will no longer need to use. 
Federal Reserve and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Authority (BaFin) assume that the ability to market the Hypo Real Estate Group now is assured. 
The hope is for shareholders and creditors of the bank. 
But given the momentum and uncertainties of the crisis there is no certainty. 
It is even possible that the funding to be used in full. 
But the opposite is not Auszuschleißen. 
After reportedly late on Sunday evening after the bank before the insolvency, can at least temporary rescue the souls not reassure. 
The stock price breaks by 75 percent to 3.30. 
well against the bond prices. 
While the show barely budged priority debt, the rates of accorded bonds clearer. 
particularly affected are the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and understandably the timeframes beyond 2009. 
seem Hypo-real-estate-bonds used a speculative investment alternative whose sound must be following the marked tightening of the banking crisis and the Institute, with the adoption of the Depfa the crisis had started shelter, be seen as dependent on the stability of the international financial system. 
as long as the central banks, governments and less risky commercial banks are prepared to support the system, while a schedule repayment of pensions. 
But it is what is hardly dares to hope that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months. 
However, given the with partial nationalization of striking, from the border security is likely only a hopeful. 
This is especially long-term creditors some sleepless nights with the decision, whether they are separated from their commitment. 
Short-term investors can end to use a loss lecture for the future full tax payments on course gains later years. 
Sylvana and the secrets of Bento box 
Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, on the first day of the Tachibana should present high school, the girls to Kichern, the German is total "Kawaii"! 
What that means? 
Sylvana knows the word from gas-in the new exchange-lied told of Japan. 
"The first day in Japan. 
I was excited. 
Even before the school way I had Bam Mel. 
I live on the fringes of Tokyo in Kawasaki and go 40 minutes by train to Tachibana high school. 
The way I had to find alone, fortunately, I am not. 
The class seems Tachibana not as strictly defined as at home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils tailspin from 8 p.m. until about twenty nine a brief meeting round begins with the teacher, 'home room'. 
But before the teaching began, I was in the series to me. 
I am not the type to people,, especially before a class of 40 pupils. 
because I have had no uniforms, I have an old rock my host mother attracted Bluse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes. 
So in this lift I have everything right before the plate and tried to say: 'Sayonara where she Sylvana ...' - I welcome Sylvana, come from Germany and birthday in a week. 
At the time, I was very happy that I had begun more than two years ago, to learn the language. 
The 31 girls in the class all Getuschelt, sniggering and Gewunken and constantly, I have heard the word "Kawaii". 
I knew from my gas. 
It is vital to vocabulary Japanese girls and means' Nice, sweet '. 
Then I am at my place Gehuscht quickly. 
The girls beside me is quite wide Gegrinst, they thought it was an honour that the exchange student sitting next to her. 
The rest of the day was relatively calm, but when the Gong chorus, I was bombarded. 
All talked about confusion and Kics tens and asked me holes in the gut-it is really difficult to understand English. Japanese 
In the break pack, then all their Bentos. 
my host mother had me as a lunchbox-that is something other than the Vapid German Pausenbrote. 
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, Salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the Tofumantel. 
mostly, I have no clue what exactly I eat here in Japan. 
things look strange taste and completely original. 
What is clear is that everything is real Lecker. 
well, up to the salty lodged plum perhaps Brrrr! 
The Bentos in Japanese schools not just lunch. 
It is sometimes that a girl a young a bout Bento takes that will particularly artfully terms-in the hope that the young in the Pausensnack closer. 
I read in my Manga-comic strip. 
I am curious whether I can see here. 
' Why Japan? ", asked my friends, when I told them that I want to go to school for a year in Tokyo. 
I have always said: 
"Because I am fascinated now." 
Finally, I have read for years preferably gas. 
and so I understand the comic strip and the culture better, I have some started to learn a bit of Japan. 
I was quite clear that I eventually had to travel here. 
because I have a penchant for tradition and customs. 
and the one great value. 
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends on the other hand it is strictly, disciplined and traditionally. 
and because everything is so well organised, I have also not yet felt lost, even if Tokyo is the city that I have ever seen. " 
rats have feelings 
a rat or a Schabe flight in risk means that they also fear? 
The neuro scientists Joseph Ledoux is convinced: More animals have feelings. 
But how could one check whether they feel the same, if you like we behave? 
In the Internet magazine 'edge' contributions famous scientists published for several years. 
Mirror presented online in a series of selected answers to the question, "What do you think of true, without being able to prove it?" 
I believe that animals feelings and other awareness conditions, without that I or anyone else this where we have so far proved not to prove that other people aware. 
But in this case, we must at least hope, because all human brains the same basic configuration. 
But as soon as we turn to other species and issues of sensitivity or raise awareness in general, we are impassable terrain, because the hardware agrees. 
If a rat in danger, it is the same as many other animals: it is dead, retreats or addresses. 
people behave similarly, which some scientists to a comparable subjective experience. 
However, I do not believe it. 
two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult, our subjective experience to the animals. 
A close almost always with the human consciousness associated circuits for Prefrontal Cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and the executive -/management functions). 
This broad region is much more developed than the people the other primates and seems to lack in all other creatures. 
At least those aspects of our consciousness that depend on Prefrontal cortex, including the know who we are, and the ability to plan and to decide, there is reason to believe that the man is different from other primates. 
another tragic character, in the linguistic nature of the people: because such a large part of his experiences with language, it has often been said that the awareness is from. 
In this case we could exclude animals. 
But even if awareness depended not language, would certainly affect it, so animal awareness, as it may be found, probably very of most of our consciousness-conditions differences. 
It is difficult to identify, as awareness in other animals may be. 
If, as something and subjective, neither judge nor, given the specific hardware, based on our own experience analyse, so his research we face great problems. 
Most of my comments relate to the content of the deliberate experiences, but there is also another aspect of consciousness, the scientific should be easily accessible. 
It could be the awareness processes of animals, irrespective of their content, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the Visualisierung. 
But this approach, the Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, moved it on the neural Korrelate awareness rather than on the causal mechanism: they may or may not be identical. 
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the Prefrontal cortex, for achieving the Visualisierung. 
What is now for the feelings? 
I attribute it to the fact that an emotional system as the fear in a conscious brain activated its own activity. 
What we refer to as the "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves, if the activity in the brain Lokalisierten defence system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) working memory. 
So, feelings closely linked to those areas of the cortex, the primates and in particular to the people. 
together with the linguistic nature is fine we varying degrees of sensitivity, because, with the help of words and grammar distinguish situations and able to categorise it for others as well as ourselves. 
Antonio Damasio says, for example, that sentiments from more primitive activities in the body feeling regions of the brain cortex and the tribal similar Jaak Pankseep, but more focused on the brain stem. 
as this network in the course of human evolution have not changed much, it could be involved in GATT of overarching sentiments. 
In theory, I cannot disagree, but I think it is Unbeweisbar. 
Pankseep argues that in rats and people like fear appear, is probably in both cases: But how can one check whether rats and people feel the same, if you behave in the same way? 
A fleeing Schabe at risk if they fear? 
in my eyes can mere behaviour like this does not equal experiences show. 
It helps the neural comparison: rats and people have similar brain tribes, Schaben, not even a brain. 
But the brain stem is responsible for feelings? 
and even if the evidence for the people: as wanted to prove it in rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even Schaben (who knows?), feelings. 
But I do not know how I should prove it. 
and because their sentiments will likely radically from our own (as the human consciousness based on specific, and language), Erforsche I prefer the emotional behaviour as the emotional feelings of rats. 
In any case, this progress on the neural level, if we in rats and people the same. 
as I Erforsche language and consciousness not in rats, feelings, as I do not know whether they exist. 
You may think that is short-sighted, but I am rather than constantly run against a wall. 
I am just a practical Emotionalist. 
UEFA president Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine 
The Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations soon under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister. 
"The government is UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as confidence in the Ukraine and its ability to organise the championships together with Poland," said Wasjunik. 
"But this is not an amnesty for our country. 
The work has only just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries. " 
The timetable for the construction or renovation of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports lag behind the two hosts. 
Perhaps even the number of Euro-stadium reduced from eight to six. 
"We cannot waste any more time. 
We must now work with maximum speed, "said the Ukrainian Federation President Grigorij Surkis. 
"UEFA will constantly in mind." 
an even more radical step was decided in Poland. 
The leaders of the Polish Association Pzpn is suspended after numerous scandals of the national Olympic committee and has been replaced by the independent Administrator Robert Zawlocki. 
The commission was to question of sports minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
There is "a serious risk that the Pzpn is unable to act in accordance with the rules," Drzewiecki said the Polish news agency PAP. 
"We have UEFA president Michel Platini in a letter that the preparations for Euro 2012 will not suffer." 
Several first division alone were convicted of manipulation to compulsory decline in the last season, finally, even had to be postponed the league start in the short term. 
outraged Dennis Quaid fights back 
They wanted to promote a new film, said in the interview on private-and now has trouble with the former: Hollywood star Meg Ryan Outete their Verflossenen Dennis Quaid as Ehebrecher. 
The foam-and fights back. 
late roses war in the ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid, seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors is an ugly dispute with each other-in public. 
Meg Ryan, in an interview with the US-Instyle magazine last week for the first time on the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis was forsaking me for a long time, and it was very painful." 
The scale of the fraud, it only after divorce in experience. 
The reason for the Seelenstriptease was Ryans press work for their new film "the women" tells the story of adultery. 
Dennis Quaids reaction to his outing as Ungetreuer husband was clear: "outrageous", said the 54-year-old in the New York Daily News that "Meg yet again the history of our relationship Wiederkäut and Umdichtet". 
It would also "regrettable" that the 16-year-old son Jack again "publicly to the pain and the upheaval, a divorce for every child."

Signs of the tense situation is the deletion Unprofitabler routes in airlines, and the high number of airlines that have declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008-they were 24 airlines in Europe alone.

Dark matter influenced air space probes 
For years, a mystery phenomenon in research for dilemma: dark matter influenced the pace of space probes during so-called swing-by-manoeuvres. 
Experts fear that the Einstein's general theory of relativity Albert might not be quite right. 
Almost 18 years flew the spacecraft "Ulysses" by the space. 
because as soon as freezing fuel pipelines it now threatens the cold death. 
among scientists for years a mystery phenomenon for confusion-the swing-by-an anomaly. 
The swing-by a manoeuvres space probes, the additional momentum in gravitating a celestial body, such as the earth. 
This can save the probes much fuel. 
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as well as the Ulysses solar probe. 
What the researchers has for years been surprised, however: the missiles are not 100-percent, as it would expect after the ancient law of gravity. 
Rather it is to irregularities in the speed. 
The probes are unexpectedly faster or slower. 
Until now, the physicist explain this effect. 
They Tauften him swing-by-an anomaly. 
Some experts fear that perhaps the Einstein's general theory of relativity Albert, the attraction of matter described by a curvature of the area, not quite right. 
The American physicist Stephen Eagle of the Institute for advanced study in Princeton remains firmly believes that Einstein erred not, and the swing-by-anomaly with the so-called dark matter, the astronomers in the universe. 
"dark matter could be responsible for the anomaly, which also could be very near the earth", he writes. 
The existence of dark matter know the space researchers only ten years ago. 
It is clearly a magnet, whose effect on other celestial body watching. 
On the other hand, you yourself is totally invisible, which means that it sends out and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially not visible light. 
according to the calculations of scientists makes the dark matter is about a fifth of the total mass of the universe.

Obscure street in town, often forgotten and perhaps to sell soon 
New York City has thousands of main roads, the side streets and other bypass roads, which some famous and others are comfortable. 
It is even for experienced taxi drivers and long-term local difficult to tell where extra place is, simply because most have never heard of it. 
This tiny Street in the East village and is the first street north between the Bowery and Second Avenue, without the second street. 
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and see to a dusty alleyway rather than after an active used travel streets. 
There is no road signs. 
It is practically impossible, on a standard road plan. 
The road has nevertheless your admirer. 
for example, Avalon Bay, a construction company, recently Luxuriöse buildings on the first street. 
It wants extra place new Pflastern, a clean pass to the shops and boutique in the new buildings are expected. 
On the other Verehrern is the longstanding neighbourhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alleyway, simply because it is a bloc houses the remnants of the past. 
But the city administrative department, which is responsible for protection and housing and is responsible for the road, has no interest in it. 
During a meeting of the land use committee of the municipal council in this month, representatives of the city council and Avalon Bay a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company. 
However, prefers the committee that the road remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan, which will be presented next month, Susan Stetzer, the district responsible in the town 3. 
"only very little space is owned by the city and we want that extra place to the city", she said. 
"It could offer, as the road repaired and what could be done by Avalon, but we also want to see the public access guaranteed." 
Avalon Bay has announced a few months ago, the small streets-Pflastern and set up seats, including for a café, the company will lease area. 
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was for the first time during the meeting made public this month. 
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman from the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, it does not necessarily have to implement them. 
"The main purpose of the Avalon Bay is the dilapidated alleyway to renovate and make a public meeting," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale. 
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Department for building protection said it had been the desire of the city, to sell the streets and emphasised that the job of the department to develop the property rather than to administer. 
compared with its colourful neighbourhood the Bowery, extra place some of its historic impression. 
Some believe that the road their name in 1802, as a large farm, Philip Minthorne was divided up between his numerous children and a close strip of land of any claims. 
the back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock memorial, which was concluded in 2006, opened the special place and the street is most known as eligible for the photograph on the cover of the albums' rocket to Russia "of the Ramones. 
The plaster was great, said Danny fields, the managers of the Ramones, the photograph in November 1976. 
The street was full of scrap metal, shackles and parts of barrels, posters, brochures and ropes. 
Some residents, a Schliesslich bloggers who write about the Gentrifizierung of the East village, have rejected the idea of selling extra place, with the argument that this public land, as modest as it is, is to remain publicly. 
Others have extra place hailed as a rarity-a virtually unchanged cluster of the city, should be left in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, the blog called "tricky New York his obligations" (under the headline with "the book of complaints: a bitter nostalgic view of the dying city"), a part of the discussion of the city history on extra place published in the magazine "The New Yorker" appeared in 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "extra place is a small close impasse, even daytime darkness and by Verrostete metal door of warehouses, closed window and Regenrinnen over flying weeks old newspapers,". 
with a few exceptions, the road just recently appeared in one evening. 
a rat ran through the back part of the street, not far from the door, the sooner the CBGB, where today a more expensive dress shop. 
graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle was on the ground not far from a fresh set of has-beens newspapers. 
Some shoppers said they have rarely on extra place, but suggested that the road could be improved. 
fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the lure of road in their current state. 
the best years of my life, he said, were in the places, dark, wet and disgusting. 
debate about bilingual education: education in English 
In this edition of "discuss education watch, Bruce fuller and Lance T. Izumi the positions of the candidates for the bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, chief scientific staff in Kalifonischen studies and senior director in the Department of Education sciences in the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, a co-author of the book "is not as good as we think: Why the middle class needs a school choice". 
The Hispanic voters is a complex task. 
Bar rack Obama's proposals on the subject of education are a typical example. 
Obama's campaign said that "the likelihood of African-American and Hispanic students to successfully conclude the school is lower than for White pupils' - which is true. 
In order to close the performance gap, recommends Obama's education plan specifically in a bilingual transitional phase in training for those who learn English only. 
Nevertheless, the question for Obama is whether its use for the bilingual education, focused on teaching in languages other than English, his interest, to reduce the gap in performance at school. 
take as example "Sixth Street preparatory conference", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles. 
The majority of pupils are his panic and come from families with low incomes. 
More than a third of the students, many of whom are only recently in the country, learn English. 
But in 2008 amazing 100 percent pupils of the fourth class the state testing in math at a good level. 
also surprising, 93 percent of children from the fourth school in the English test as well. 
The astonishing success was achieved with other methods, as those who preferred Obama. 
The school sixth Street, its focus on exercise, constant monitoring of knowledge and an attitude that tolerated no exceptions. 
Finally, practice the school approach, after a training in the English-speaking environment. This is the point that Obama should note, the school administrator Linda Mikels. 
This approach attaches importance to the almost Ausschliesslichen use of the English language for teaching. 
Mrs Mikels, rejects the idea of bilingual education, said, the school would have a remarkable success with a pupil, only about from Mexico. 12 months later would enter school and do not see again. 
"It works", noted, "It works for us". 
would Obama a school as the "sixth Street preparatory conference" as a model for other schools with great share of Latin American and other English learners pupils? 
The performance of the school would make the answer to this question easily, but the educational positions within his own party (the National picture UNSG associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of bilingual education make predictions on Obama's answer is uncertain. 
While he supports the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue, when he said that people should stop, worried about the "English only" gathering legislation. 
Instead, he said: "They should make sure that their child can Spanish." 
If Obama wants to close the gap in performance, he carefully educational models, the work, rather than to despise and trivialize. 
The price of oil falls due to renewed fears about the economy 
On Monday, the price of oil is because of fears that even the US rescue plan for the financial markets could not enough to revive the economy, strong. 
Crude oil futures trading on the New York Stock Exchange in the morning session by 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel. 
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.

Meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments the European financial group Fortis partly nationalised. 
analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations, held at the weekend and have led to a rescue plan, apparently failed, the mood of the markets. 
As the economic situation deteriorates further, it is likely that the demand for goods, including oil, will continue to fall. 
The German Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors, the forecasts for the global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates are next few months only show whether uncertain. 
We believe, you write that the goods markets also will be affected.

team record by series in the second quarter Aufgestellr 
home defender Shaun Ellis thought that he had seen everything, in the last eight years after he more often than any other in the jets jersey on. 
Then he saw the second quarter on Sunday, in which the jets a Ergebnisloses game in a triumph turned train. 
"I have never seen," Ellis said. 
After a Schlampigem game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, the weather, began the second quarter. 
But when quarterback board Favres passport in Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown arrived, marked the the perfect start to an afternoon in which their developing cooperation a giant step forward. 
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two touchdowns, this time as an outside defenders Ausrutschte and the other time 10 seconds before the end of the half. 
"I am not particularly hard," says Coles went on the passes to Coles. 
"He is a super player. 
Our vote has, no matter what the people think. " 
While Favre and Coles, the defence played quarterback Kurt Warner. 
Foreign defender Darrelle Revis started a disastrous gamble and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown. 
Libero Erik Smith was in a different passport and him. 
linebacker David Bowen's, then for a loss of Warner. 
the last ball loss, forced in Bowen's, was probably the most insane. 
The cardinal had conquered the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the jets the ball back conquered and Jay feely a 20 yard shot to 34 0 turned. 
It was the most points the jets had ever in a quarter. 
When he was asked to describe the madness said Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets' second quarter or the third quarter? " 
to answer both, because the jets were in the third quarter to reach 21 points without a single, Mangini said: "I think, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third. 
a lot of points were in a short space of time. " 
Ausgeruhter Gebrselassie, his world record 
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has again shown why him some of the best long-distance runner of all time, after he broke his own record in the Berlin marathon on Sunday and become the first people is the distance of 42.2 kilometres in less than 2 hours, 4 minutes has managed. 
The victory on the flat rate in 2:03:59 Gebrselassie his previous result of 2:04:26 improved by 27 seconds, which he had achieved in Berlin last year. 
Gebrselassie, 35, has its 26 world record in his versatile career, in which he on every route from a kilometre to the marathon at least has a World Cup title or a world record. 
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, for fear that the afterwards was perhaps excessive that air pollution could aggravate his asthma problems. 
Instead, he has registered for the competition in Berlin. 
In near ideal conditions, Sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees on goal-Gebrselassie with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile. 
Since then, rail runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed on long-haul is the record time for marathon in the last 10 years is more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05 won. 
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had two weeks ago Krämpfe in his ankle and was therefore not train for a week. 
He is apparently to break freshness and not come back Eingerostet. 
"I am so happy," he said to reporters. 
"Everything is perfect. 
I resumed training a week ago and still had some concerns, but in the end what Super. " 
He was criticised for-especially in Kenya, Ethiopia rivals from East Africa-for his Rennläufe excessively orchestrated, many world best marathon stars generally avoiding, rely too much on the race official leader, as if that were a career race, and world records on the race. 
But this criticism harms the size Gebrselassies as long-distance runners. 
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie achieved the heart of the line in 1:02:04. 
two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi Gebrselassie continue challenges, after the pace had subsided. 
A little more than three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his last start, in order to distinguish itself from Kwambai, second in 2:05:36 arrived, and has improved his best time by almost 5 minutes. 
In 2:07:48 Kamathi was third. 
in women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, completed a remarkable year, with 2:19:19 has shown the Siebtschnellste result of all time. 
The world record of 2:15:25, Paul Radcliff from Britain. 
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London marathon in 2:24:14. 
She has missed the Games in Beijing, because of problems that have been described as a back injury, but it has recovered to win in Berlin and their best time in her third marathon to improve five minutes. 
It has sent its course planned, by a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners only from Rice Sen, but after 30 kilometres Holte. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya third in 2:25:01 arrived. 
The pride and the strain in the life of the black population, in a city of special kind 
hidden between the excesses of leisure parks around Orlando, a few miles from the flashy, noisy and gigantic drive, is a quiet city in the pride and come to light the complications of African-American culture. 
Eaton), the first completely black city in the country and the city Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer so easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three Krocketplätzen, Brown hides, 300 good swimmers do, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison." 
It is a pilgrimage site. 
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee to the annual Zora! festival in Eaton) come to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem renaissance. 
and yet and is the city that it describes-and to a tourist outing goal made by them in the Florida tour of the periods of depression by the Federal writers' project has been produced-in many ways a place of particular variety. 
Eaton) is so independent, sound and private as in the 1930s, Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share, their real thoughts with the Sen man, "so little about US, that he is not, what escapes him." 
Even today, in a year in which a black president Schaftskanditat, Senator Barack Obama, call for an open dialogue on race relations, many are still suffering from Aussenseitern observed. 
"We are very anxious as our history told," Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to residents of the city and local member of the oldest church in the city. 
It must vote. " 
Eaton) have long been defined as paradox of triumph and the fight. 
It is both a historic example of the black movement as a community of nearly 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is twice the national average. 
It is a stronghold of literature and an example of the sometimes, sometimes touted-black culture of the rural south, which has its roots in the American slavery. 
It is not surprising that the residents here are both proud and wary. 
and so began the concerns about Eaton Ville's image with Zora, as all Hurston here. 
It was the world their home town in books, which were written by heart, and mouth kind, as "mules and men" (1953) and "their eyes were watching God" (1973). 
five paragraphs in the Florida trip leaders modified the city, which is close to the route 77, a road by the often-forgotten centre of Florida, scene of black history and human tragedy. 
use as Oskar both in real life and in the literature, Hurston readers to the shop of Eatonvilles first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then more private affairs. wrote 
"off the roads on the left", she wrote, "The Brown-Weiss Angestrichene modern school, with its leafy gardens and jobs, which always Howard Miller, although he cannot read and write." 
They also mentioned the new man of widow dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "drinks sold any kind and what-also-always hours rooms." 
in only a few hundred words, Hurston Eaton) associated with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was certainly not a tour guide. 
In fact, this was not a portrait that has been appreciated by everyone. 
"Zora described the things as they were," the 90-year-old Ella Dink into one of the Johnson girls the Hurston Verewigte, quoted by the men, the songs on its beauty sang with sexual innuendo. 
She added: "Some people disliked it." 
It is still remember Hurtson as a lively Exzentrikerin Regelmässig returned, after her family, Jackson), Florida, was withdrawn. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, said that if Hurston in the city Gebraust came, they usually without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoke and in trousers, in a city even today is something its venerable dress convinced. 
According to Mr Franklin were the most fascinated people, whereas many despise. 
"People were always glad to see Zora", Mr Franklin said. 
But "you never too long", he added Schaukelte while in his chair, situated on a back terrace on the Sabelia sea, in the Hurston in all likelihood was baptized. 
When Hurston died in 1960 it was poor and abusing its books. 
together with the bulk of the world seemed to have Eaton) you forget. 
Although it was a famous author, a tin Zeitgenössin Lang Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard college in the 1920ern, was in Fort Pierce, Florida, where they lived, buried in an unmarked grave. 
In Eaton), there was no major commemoration, no public readings in the large-scale. 
"I do not think that your contribution in the world or their heritage in the slightest understood," Valerie Boyd, author of "wrapped in rainbows", a biography of Hurston was published in 2003. 
The turning point came in the 1980s. 
Orange County authorities wanted a five-lane motorway through the city, in order to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, slow two main street in the community. 
Orlandos suburbs had already pushed the motorway 4 by the western outskirts of town. 
The proposal was made, as Eaton) were still recovering from a difficult period in its history. 
forced integration, among other things, the relatively idyllic isolation of the community an end. 
In the 1950s, the fight against racial hatred in the community. 
"In this time was often a bunch of white boys and they threw oranges and toys on the sidelines seat people", said Mr Franklin. 
"There was even a woman who was killed. 
They threw a water melon from the car. " 
In 1955, Hurston asked in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the requirement of the Supreme Court to force integration, by the decision in the case of Brown versus the school Council as "insulting my race Respektierend". 
Today, residents say that although the lifting of racial segregation was positive in many ways, the groups cohesion in Eaton) and the self-awareness of its young people weakened. 
"black children were there used to be embraced-I remember-we embrace his teachers in the morning and we embrace his teachers at night" so N. so Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dink and executive director of the nonprofit group for the protection of Eaton) community. 
This could be maintained so long, they added, until teachers and pupils no longer came from the same place. 
"We embrace his white teachers not because he was a white teacher-I mean, there is a cultural gap", said Mrs Nathiri. 
But the citizens' rights helped that room for further Zora Neale Hurstons was created-black writers, actors and artists who flout prejudices, as it did, with positive self-awareness and statements such as: "How can someone the pleasure I refuse society! 
I do not understand it. " 
In 1975, the author Alice Walker on the way to Hurstons anonymous grave and began to revive their glory. 
Five years later was a much praised Hurston-biography of Robert E. Hemenway shelves in the books, and made it to a part of the American Literaturkanons again. 
The roads project was at a time in the Eatonvilles famous daughter once again in the light of public opinion. 
And this time, Hurstons old neighbours as Retterin. 
The city began in 1988 with the planning a Hurston festivals to show what the county with the construction of the highway could destroy. 
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January return many of the celebration. 
A few years later, the area of its road construction plans. 
"The plans a Fünfspurigen in crowded the city, accelerated the whole top speed, gave real citizens proud", said Mrs Nathiri. 
Mrs Boyd put it somewhat easier: "Zora saved Eaton)." 
The victory against the roads project has helped change the image of the city. 
There were more and more traveled, as RAC bright Munson, a lawyer, since 1993 here in the Church, and local began the past New. 
Eaton) in the 1998 national historic register. 
A new Einstöckige library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 at the Neugepflasterten and Verschönerten Kennedy Boulevard. 
Today, Eaton) is still a special in Florida: just 6 miles from the city centre Orlandos can sometimes Anfühlen as an alleyway in summer, as little as was the only 27 black families in the 1880ern was founded. 
(It is currently 90% black.) 
outsiders in the search for the history Eatonvilles and its importance still often treated with caution. 
For most interviews a prior approval is necessary and certain things-as the Wandbemalung of Eatonvilles eldest church, which was painted by a Wei ice and black men in the field work-must not be photographed. 
Many in Eaton), as Mrs Jones, a bold, confident teacher with a penchant for dark red, still fear that their secretive community misunderstood. 
And yet, at the same time to the greater the Hurston festival was born, was also a greater degree of homeland pride. 
Young people in particular tend to see, Eaton) such as Hurston their entire race saw: beautiful, with all its problems, either worse or better and just as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed as any other racial and ethnic group in America. 
It is the genuine love of this city in the voice of Mr Franklin nephew can hear, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, intends to return to Eaton) to work in the city government or the police, according to the aid could use him anything. 
and even the younger, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from winter Park, have learned, Eaton) right to describe. 
"Most people who only to drive here, will think: "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the other", said Alondra Kenon recently after the church on Sunday. 
"But if you actually stop and a moment his history, it is a very beautiful city." 
here in New York is fluent financial Latin. 
At first glance, nothing has changed. 
If tourists in Manhattan of the newspaper and the huge television screens in Times Square absented, they would not feel that they are in the midst of a debacle. 
They would never believe that on their minds, the shoe box offices with glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, every day the worst horror working day since the stock fall of 1929. 
The suppliers deny still noisy Klappern the metal tea without weighing up along sidewalks and promote Tabletts are loaded with muffins for breakfast meetings.

It is not as a crisis, until I decided Thursday afternoon because all of the doomsday rhetoric to open a new savings account. 
Though I decided my duty time on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribe subsidiary, some 20 people were queuing. 
It is not the money switchgear paid off or money, but the customer service desk where good checkbooks, tourists after the department store Macy's and where new customer accounts open. 
Most before me, as I learned later from rigid, my "personal bank employees with licence", for the same reason as I queue. 
However, unlike me, you have already had their savings of smaller banks removed, in places from where they shuttle, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island. 
They had money from so-called Thrifts (a construction little savings Ähnelnd), mutual and the local savings banks and branches in only one state, into orbit and say that they treat their customers as family. 
Last year, 15 of those banks quietly gone bankrupt. 
In the last few days, Washington mutual, a bank with assets of $327 billion, in bankruptcy administration and as New York over weekend went home last Friday, Wachovia, another bank, saving money in the value of $440 billion, in search of a saving buyers. 
The fear of a further blow, the office and shop staff were which I can operate it on the bank is seen as a safe haven for most, a Bank rescue is responsible for purchases made on Wall Street.

At its last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam. 
Both parties want to ban the building of mosques and minarets in the argument that these political symbols are a constant Islamization of Austria and Europe.

Isabel Bayón calls on the memory of the dancers from Seville Tórtola Valencia 
A Flamencotänzerin Seville revered a dancer, the Seville. 
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusierin (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), it is the quarter-born Ana and when she was three years old, is your family moved to London. 
She was a dancer and expert on Oriental dances. 
It was an exciting life, she was one of the first of the emancipation of women, as Isa Dora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
It was Buddhistin, Vegetarierin and campaigned for the abolition of the corset, which limited free movement of women. 
The life of the woman, their traces in the dance-and aesthetic revolution in Europe has left behind in the period between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón. 
' I wanted to Pepa Gamboa work and has suggested to me this role, which I thought impossible. ' 
"We are not trying to talk about their lives, special to maintain their Esprit," said the Flamencotänzerin. 
their dance bases have helped me much Flamenco. 
'The Dance of the butterfly' I, for example, as Guajira, or 'the dance the snake' as tango. 
their dance was sense, and I have been told that my dance in this aesthetic is', it claims. 
The performance with two exceptional work: with Miguel Poveda, the time for Isabel when their ideas Sing, as it did in 'La Puerta Abierta'; and Flamenco-champion, Matilde Corral, who once wanted to work together with their ex-schoolchildren. 
"Matilde Tórtola, plays a very mature personality. 
I am happy, because they had agreed to help my work, and I feel very honoured.' 
The piece also with musical composition and Gitaristen Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the song of Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Morón, percussion from El Pájaro, and the Viola of Rafa Viola and cooperation with the actor Juan Franglais Júarez, 'is the role of the aid of artists, the divas were, in which he always love.' 
In this work also told in a certain way of life this woman who so far in places such as India, the United States or Russia and also in all Europe was known, although they normally lived in London. 
' I wanted to remember, because I think it is one of the women who have a huge influence on a certain era and whose works today not to appreciate more and therefore less', Bayón says. 
The idea will take place today at 20:30 in theatre Lope de Vega. 
The publication of the book ' Diario de UN Poeta Recién Casado ' includes the Triennium. 
The presentation of the first magazine edition of ' Diario de UN Poeta Recién Casado ' in the St Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez 1916 Zenobia married an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture, to the Triennium Zenobia and Juan Ramón ' (2006) to celebrate.

The United States can imagine without Paul Newman bad 
' sometimes creates God perfect people. 
Paul Newman was one of them. ' 
The sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, worked with him in Sensationsreporterin ', and the prevailing idea of American cinema which was abandoned, of America to Newman with its exciting vision, and followed her. 
Now, what it cost to award him the Oscar. 
and when he withdrew in 2007. 
and he knew that he was very sick. 
Nevertheless, it was a major blow to all. 
'What sometimes feels, is much more than an expression of, and now I have lost a great friend', said Robert Ford red wine, 'my life and my country were the biggest Drolligkeiten his life.' 
None had fear not ridiculous even to exaggerate. 
'father' of cinema and the father died in a sad moment he is in the fear of terrorists and the market collapse, beaten in the self-esteem of Americans in the desperate search for reasons, dignity back. 
If only a few people in this hard time without virtue, which you can admire, so it should not necessarily be Luis Cernuda, Paul Newman love. 
for all, he represented almost a Plato ideal of beauty and truth. 
He was the official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as various loss both profits: the foundation, which has committed to the fight against drugs and as a tribute to his son from the first marriage, died of overdoses, was founded by the internal own brand and organic products. 
This is all a gift for the country, which cost him much trouble, against a deadly food culture. 
A broad wave of surprise, House high on Hollywood regardless of nationalities and citizenship. 
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died, but the whole era. 
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winners, said that the work with Newman, no more and no less than the tip of his career. 
Russell Crowe, the evil young, from Australia, dared, Newman as his greatest inspiration. 
' ' leave us, the largest US all, George Clooney confirmed, perhaps a few who dare today try to live as Paul Newman lived: high standards of honesty, a good private life, far away from the cameras. 
It is not always easy or not even possible in today's media jungle. 
But there is someone to try it, and Paul Newman was an example. 
It was a different time and was then 50 years with Joanne Woodward married, he was loyal, although it certainly many opportunities was not to be. 
' What should I eat a hamburger on the streets, if I have home fillet? ", Scherzte he often itself. 
It will be proud that in heaven on earth his daughters the same view as his fans, which is customary in America not necessarily. 
' of all major roles he played, no, he was so proud of the loyal spouse, the loving father, the attentive Opas and the philanthropists', they say. 
for the Olympic Games are the streets in Madrid flawed. 
Yes, the dream of many of us, some Olympic disciplines to organise in Madrid, following the failure of 2012, there is perhaps 2016. 
But I wonder: 'We are prepared for this?' 
Yes, we follow the example of the old road, I would say that it is not true! 
It was described as the perfect road, and in my opinion, it was the worst road with all and off it. 
That is a lot of nonsense, of course, if the assessment would respect and I could examine it, would be so clearly. 
But, we are all from the outset. 
The nonsense begins with the ticket over that allows you to go first. 
It seems to me not bad, but if you have you do, then you should you everything (including chip, in order to avoid the congestion on the road). 
But that is not so. 
Here you get only the ticket (the first nonsense, which consists of only then) and (after an endless queues) there is the surprise, the T-shirt was only in size 's' (a second nonsense because I need size XL) 
where we actually live? 
Or is it that after the crisis was only small, much cheaper to buy shirts from less fuel? 
well, matters like these are a small in comparison to the days on the road. 
Apart from the fact that we need to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, left the rucksack. must be 
The wait has more than 35 minutes long, as in the case of a street, where 11,000 people expected, is incomprehensible. 
Finally, as it was to be expected, the streets and we had our Rücksäcke not left, even if it was even managed back, but it would be difficult. 
It was, in these 40 minutes waiting for rain, so it came to the temptation to organise a popular uprising and was excited about. 
I think tomorrow will certainly some 500 people have pneumonia and some as I because this chip, I have, not even time for the classification, I can think of is that the outcome was wrongly labelled. 
of course, if you ask me for a perfect road, this road would never come. 
so I think that we are still long dream of a city that is prepared for the Olympic Games 
Microsoft in search of a (virtual) Rezeptionistin 
on the ' ' emerging technology conference, of the progress, Microsoft has presented the new image recognition system and human interaction, a nature of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is able to do some primitive tasks such as a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft is this an routes planners, on the campus of the company). The system observed what it during the listening position. 
Thanks to a camera and a form-and face recognition system, the 'Rezeptionistin' see how many people are in the area, who they are and even remember, as they were held, it can listen and understand the key words their entertainment. 
It can also present after the talks in the groups. 
In a video the 'Rezeptionistin' a third person, but she understands that person to lead the group with her conversation, not belongs, and that is not a company employee. 
It asks for, whether the person wants to visit someone and says that soon they will be listening. 
All without the blue screenshot 
impressive 
This is the future. 
Now the company has better things, it can concentrate on the next version of its Windows operating system, for example. 
This week they talked very little on the change of strategy of Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be quicker and not included so many programmes. 
Steve Ballmer, said that if the computer equipped with the necessary, rather than to fill them with the commercial waste, they would be five work faster. man, Steven, this will be only for a few. 
Everything is just a statement, considering that Microsoft Windows versions one or other function and 'extras' on. 
The shift is worth 
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing important, as well as the software. 
As Google chromium in network, this was a part of the theory that it was the first step of Google, in order to compete with Windows. 
sent many to suggest that the browser is not operating system. 
The operating system, as a vital part will always be needed to ensure that hardware and software can work. 
The operating system meets the role that compared with his wife or husband can be, when it comes to inform his mother of something. 
This is true. 
The system will never disappear, but it must be his' death ', not as an absolute, but rather as a relative truth. 
Ballmer said this week, the confirmation of this idea. 
people pay less attention every time the operating system, for the Web browser. 
The computer will only started to fire Fox, the explorer or carry out chromium and every day we spend more time on surfing, as in the vicinity of the 'window'. 
What is the half in computer existing applications? 
Less is More 
and Windows 7, compact, much more compact than Vista. 
easier, not so excessive, less complicated. 
The interest of Microsoft's is more to integrate its online services, then finally the alternative to Google. 
The reality is, without a doubt. I bring a small example. 
I took a photo of this place in red moon, in a recreational spaces for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month. 
attached to the soft drinks machine is a shield: 'your search. Our future'. It prints a request from their own tools for online search. 
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66 percent of employees at Microsoft, Google for the research on the network. 
Moreover, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 in the delay. 
It will not initially, but at the end of 2009, more even 2010. 
Microsoft looks the possibility, Windows 7, and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time on the mark. 
Every day turned the phone in a computer. 
The Android and the Iphon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money. 
Le Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso in Costa Azul Angehabt, Leonardo Di cap Rio had this brand in 'blood diamond' by Edward Zwick, just as Al Pacino in 'The Godfather' of Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it is clothes of a well-built pastor.

The 'Alcolock' would prevent this, because it is a system linked with the car, it believes the alcohol content in the Ausgeatmeten air and prevent car start, when the driver has made alcohol test; or if alcohol concentration, higher than is allowed. 
It costs more than 1,000 euro, the cost of one, the sanction.

There is not 1000, but a way to chaotic rapid everyday life. 
and if there are too few, are all collected in a book, which is how to defuse. The book in bookshops on 30 September. 
Wecker is a punishment if he rings at 7 a.m., but even worse, the idea of again living in the frenetic rhythms, the current demands, purely. 
The office is the tension and the computer, which lead to the back pain. 
The stress is the evil of the 21st century. 
But there is not one, not two methods to the daily exhaustion and the problems, as it shut down by the world of work to combat. 
But the number is rising, no more and no less than by 1001. 
In addition to yoga positions, the traditional massage or SPA treatments, Susan close Marriott in the book the whole list of options that are adapted to the taste and time each,. 
The work against stress is '1001 opportunities to relax' and as a result, what the book, in a bookshop in the Alhambra and DK publishing Pearson. 
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible, the calm in the areas such as job with the help of personal contacts, so refuted this manual believe such.

in their sleep talking 
Some children at night 
I do not believe those who wake up and tell us something in what happened the day before, but the child during the sleep. 
If it is for the first time you, in the best case scenario, you will be shocked, but in reality, the no importance. 
It is a positive sleep disruption, the talk in their sleep. 
It is fairly common, especially among children and young people. 
Certainly, was told more than one of you that you have spoken night. 
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (a time in life, for example, as during the high fever), or regular (every day, once per week, once a month), the next day the child to remember nothing. 
There is no reason this phenomenon. 
often sought links with other phenomena in sleep, as nightmares, terrified night, Enuresis Noctura (Bettnässen night), in their sleep, but there is no reason for it. 
as we mentioned earlier, it can in very high fiber, stress situations or on demand. 
In any case, it is a little Erforschtes phenomenon. 
The frequency with which it occurs, is very variable. 
It may be that the calm in individual words, Flüstert or it can be a contrary (cries, wines, long debates). 
In those cases, if the statement is very hard, it is recommended that the child and specialists, to discuss, to examine whether a problem, which caused fear and in this way. 
We have said that it is a positive disruption, so it will not dealt with, whether it is with a different sleep disorder, which can be treated (for example, with the sleep-Apnoe or stress). 
What we do is, a series of simple preventative measures: 
try not to arouse the child before sleep. 
So, quiet game for the child choose and avoid stress-television programmes, the terrible and a little too wild. 
The nervous children, which recommended tensions, can be applied relaxation methods, to help them to get some internal calm. 
This helps the child to sleep. 
If this happens again in their sleep, tried to remain calm. 
remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will be to not remember what happened. 
useful advice 
It inspires. 
This is useless, because the child is unconsciously, so will pull it from the sleep. 
Although the baby, sleep, so it rests. 
Remember, though it remains a few hits shows, recommends, to discuss or what the child for the fear. 
If you understand what it says (which is not usually is), the baby under pressure to carry out an interrogation and information out. 
so you will able to achieve nothing, because if the baby is sleeping, it is not and will not reflect. 
Also, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says, so you have to be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions that it. 
Perhaps, says the child is not that her the night and know his secrets. 
not even as a joke. 
This caused much fear. 
So, you is not concerned, there is nothing wrong, this is a moment that lasts only a few minutes. 
Last Illhäusern ... 
After a long drought is on the pitch Illhäusern once again success rate. 
without major effort Erspielten the yellow-black many door opportunities and made it, one of them, and to win the game.

Obama should its lead on Thursday, with the good performance of his competitors Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin, is expected to confirm. 
"It would be a mistake to underestimate them. 
It has good instincts', but warned Bill Clinton this weekend. 
The 70-year-old McCain heard and his undoubted experience in the field of foreign policy in the fore, and clearly the 'naive' to underline his opponent on these issues, the heart of the first TV-Duells. 
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that ... ', he several times. 
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and expertise in order to become president ', he also assured. 
a target, since yesterday in the Republican election advertising preached. 
Obama himself said that he represents the future. 
He spoke briefly and precise to bring without the version. 
He got his ability to make good decisions in the foreground, and the image to the world of the United States, to renew. 
McCain has still not understood, Obama has', this weekend a democratic election advert has been accused in the Republicans, not to have grasped the full extent of the crisis that the 'Americans' from the street. 
' during the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you ', denounced Obama yesterday before 20,000 people, who at an election rally in North Carolina in Strömendem rain had gathered.

The Democratic candidate, the current crisis is' the final judgment of eight poor economic policy, implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain has been '. 
After he had reiterated that it would create, even the taxes for 95% of Americans to reduce despite the volatility on Wall Street, the senator from Illinois indicated that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, a top priority for him blocks.

"Have you noticed that an election was held in Minsk? ' 
Young people and opposition demonstrated Sunday night on the main square of the Belarus capital, to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance. 
A few hundred White Russians gathered Sunday evening for closure of polling stations on the market square in Minsk, in order to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections. 
Although no result was announced, many young people were, in order to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator should resign'. 
Some say that they do not have chosen: 'what benefits when they always do what they want with my', says a young people. 
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown the foreign observers in the best light, to resume negotiations with the European Union, is prepared, a democratic change. 
The sanctions, including the does not grant visas for 40 senior Belarussian people and put some assets, could be lifted if these elections from the observers would be seen as clean. 
According to the opposition, they were not. 
"We have been excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the count ', lamented Yuri Potemkin, spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous merger of 12 parties. 
This is a cosmetic change, said Alexander Milinkevitch, former opposition candidate for the presidential elections 2006 and leader of the pro-Europe-movement, because it is important, who counts the votes for, and that is the executive. 
If members of the opposition in parliament, then because they were appointed, not elected. 
But their entry into parliament can air time on television, meeting in the regions and legislative proposals.' 
The opposition is guilty of interfering in the political game, because 'the dialogue with the European Union must be opened. 
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt to Russia, in a crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of a Russian protectorate. 
Now, we want to be independent. 
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the voting process, the election not recognised as valid. 
They stressed that the election participation figures seem too high, and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of voters to Minsk) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation. 
"Have you noticed that an election? asks the leader of the Social-Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners were released in August of this year. 
Nobody was in the polling stations. 
and a maximum of five members of the opposition in parliament, and those who best reflect the wishes of the government. ' 
The quiet night lower again on the October Square. 
In television congratulate President Lukachenko and members of the Central Election Commission on their success. 
INTERVIEW-the blood that was safe again 
Hema-Quebec yesterday celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding, and its President, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec is one of the safest and most effective blood banks in the world. 
and above all it has public confidence restored by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s, was severely shaken. 
As you know, were administered by the Canadian Red Cross blood services national blood reserves during the 1980's with the hi-virus and the Hepatitis C virus contaminated. 
Given this tragedy and public discontent, the Canadian government in February 1994, a public, by the judge Horace Krever led investigation, it aimed to bring light into the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and directives, in order to prevent another disaster of this kind. 
While judges Krever still delayed, his report, then several provinces, whose objective was a committee on its feet, a new system for managing blood in Canada. 
in Quebec, met the committee Gélineau this task. 
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever in Canada two blood banks: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and Canadian blood society, the other provinces, and the two territories. 
'1998 Hema-Quebec began their work, had little 38% of people confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Dr Décary remembers. 
The situation was daunting. 
The enormous efforts to improve the safety of the blood and by work in this area during the following years, we have the confidence of the public back ', it says that before they stressed that proud at the beginning of 2008 nearly 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec. 
However, Dr Décary reserves in the awareness that something is very fragile confidence. 
Since its founding on 28 September 1998 Hema-Quebec after the principle of caution. 
This time we saw the number of cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, told the woman who holds the leadership since the 1998 establishment. 
"And we had not the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted over the blood. 
so when we are on one of the main Krever reports and Gélineau directives, the exclusion, it measures apply, if we do not know this and if the disease progresses slowly, as it appears in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death. 
So, in April 1999, no blood of people in more than a month since 1980 had stayed in the United Kingdom. 
Now, a few years ago without any doubt demonstrated that this disease over the blood. 
This event has shown us that the principle of caution that we apply, is a sense. 
In 1999, on the market a much more precise technology to identify HIV: the nucleic acid testing (NST), which will make it possible to directly in the blood of the donor prove the existence of the virus itself, and not what the antibodies against the virus, as was the case in the hitherto tests. 
The NST allowed to shorten the incubation period between the time the infected person and, if the first viruses through our techniques can be found in blood, said the expert. 
This time could be reduced to a period of less than a week. 
The risk that some donors could be infected without knowing it, and we could not see much reduced. 
These improvements enabled, the risk of AIDS on a blood transfusion, to reduce significantly. 
Today, one of 12 million people is at risk of with HIV-infected blood. 
"In other words, that distribute blood to 12 million, before someone infected with HIV. 
Hema-Quebec each year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood distributed, it would take more than 24 years, before a case, in the HIV on blood automatic. 
I believe that we can now play feel, if you get a blood transfusion or prescribed to restore the health ', says the direct them head of Hema-Quebec. 
"Our challenge for the next ten years is the safety of our products. 
One never knows what pathogens can reach into the system. 
Only last year, on the island of Réunion the Chikungunya virus appeared that, just as the Westnil-virus, transmitted by insects on the blood. 
We must continuously monitor ', continued Dr Décary, before they stressed that Hema-Quebec alongside a secure supply must also provide a sufficient supply. 
' the growing demand, because the population is ageing. 
The treatments for cancer aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells and platelets. 
The ageing of the population is also on the average blood donor network that the only 3% of the donations appropriate Quebec. ' 
Every healthy person, the 18 years or older, and the eligibility criteria, all 56 days, six times a year, blood. 
On average, 14% of people, their blood available, not accepted, because they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, for example, and who has travelled in a country where malaria is widespread, is excluded from the donations for a year. 
"With these 3% we create an inventory, meets the needs of the hospitals. 
A lack of supplies are very rare. 
But we must renew the members of this donor network, if they are older and no longer a blood donations. 
It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all, you and make them regular donors. 
Life is now so hectic that you rarely can take the time to spend an hour in donations', Francine Décary regrets. 
with an annual budget of $297 million provides Hema-Quebec not only blood, but also human tissues, including bone marrow transplants, heart valves, Augäpfel and skin, the almost exclusively in serious violations of fire. 
these tissues are being analysed, processed and frozen before with Hema-Quebec between are stored, which also managed the only public cord blood bank of Quebec. 
In the umbilical cord, which was previously seen as biomedical waste, blood is rich in stem cells, which can serve, serious diseases such as leukaemia. 
A few weeks ago we celebrated the stockpiling our thousandth umbilical cord blood test, and we plan to buy more than a thousand per year. 
' We should start at the beginning of next year, it available for transplants', said Dr Décary on this programme of umbilical cord blood loss describes as very popular. 
' many mothers are convinced, have no access to ', because Hema-Quebec lack the resources, this complex and expensive programme in all hospitals offer Quebec. 
Soccer-impact in the semi-finals 
Montreals impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1-victory (4 to 3 with all the gates) against the Sounders from Seattle in the second and decide the quarter finals series in Saputo Stadium, in which the total to relationship, for the semi-final round of games out of first league Usl qualified.

He received roaring applause. " 
Charest on the north 
The prime minister does not, elections before the end of the year. 
when the General Assembly of the Liberal Party went to end, Jean Charest yesterday after Jean-talon in Quebec, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected in today's part. 
' The delay during our last great northern borders': this is the long-term goal, the Jean Charest yesterday with Visual resources at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levi presented, and he followed the guidelines. 
During his presentation was behind him a kind of projected images mill. 
Three huge screens on Spectacular images of hydroelectric plants, mines, Quebec, "Google maps', maps, etc. 
Large funds as during the election period. 
The press refused to exclude the Prime Minister, incidentally, that he will hold elections this autumn, although he claimed that his diary was great. 
The North 'plan' is the fourth element of a 'vision', the prime minister has apparently for Quebec, namely a 'new' economic area, an agreement with France on labor, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario. 
Although the last time often mentioned in the Prime Minister's remarks was the opening up of the north-the northern area to the 49sten latitude-has never been subject of a presentation. 
However, the prime minister, to explain why the North' is a jewel with enormous potential, but no date, investment or exact priorities for the next projects. 
Only some prospects for What more could be done, particularly in the water energy, in the forest, but particularly in the mining sector, encouraged by growth in emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructure. 
The list, according to Mr Charests has the North 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, steel, titanium and even diamonds'. 
This is twice the size of France 'area' 'in our close, in Quebec. 
It is not only our near, it is in US', he pointed out, like to show clearly that he wants to achieve a national founder dream. 
Quebec is very by its link with the north, he said: The Road to gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, the James Bay. 
"It is US, it is our future ', he added, after he had filed a dramatic break with the huge card behind itself. 
The North, 70% of the area of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador, the Quebec always claimed, the Prime Minister said in the press. 
"This is a traditional attitude, that all governments. 
There is a border line, in which there is no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity I will take this stance on behalf of the government, ', he said. 
Also, 'with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North', he said, speaking about the North-West passage, due to the Eisschmelze will be used throughout the year. 
In this new geopolitical backdrop, the prime minister is that it is a duty to fill this area. 
and the people of the region, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit? 
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec very careful would deal with them, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the young. 
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekistischer member of Ungava) have begun discussions on about 30 communities. 
A ministerial committee led by Demurely Pelletier, in the Julie Boulet (transportation and mineral resources) has an important role to play, the work. 
The Prime Minister does not exclude a grand assembly, "is not a 'summit, but an opportunity,' we will create a common vision '. 
In addition, the development of the North will take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. 
The plan north' - regulated and environment', he promised. 
Jean Charest described this' vision ', as if it were a continuation of those Liberal Prime Minister, before him were in office. 
"As the Liberals, the US were in office, we turn that around, about the challenges in new growth and development Chan Chen. 
This was one of the issues raised repeatedly for the weekend on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the party leadership has been opened by Jean Les age. 
One of the adopted resolutions, the power of Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout-dam change. 
' Godbout, the hydro-Quebec has created, Les age, of the quiet revolution and has achieved the nationalisation of water, electricity, Bourassa, the James-Bay, knew our party to determine the future', said Jean Charest. 
The press against took it on another, this conservative project, and on the roads to the North' programme of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963. 
In relation to the hydroelectric dam project Eastmain1a-Ruper, said Mr Charest whose operation is scheduled for 2012. 
' The remains of us, but I have to be here ', he trusted his party members on what those ovations. 
The Prime Minister, said in April that the 2008 and 2009, would be no elections, has the option of holding an election this autumn, which it is possible, by law, cannot be ruled out. 
However, he stressed that his diary is full, especially for a mission of community in China and a summit between Quebec and New York. 
The General Assembly at the weekend earned the liberal leader a platform from nationalist plans, especially from 'the constitution' objectives, easily adopted: the PLQ particularly calls for the recognition of the 'specificity of Quebec' in the constitution. 
They would also like to Quebec appoints members of the Council of the Canadian Broadcasting and telephony, and that have a veto on decisions in Quebec. 
The opposition, the guidelines of the plan north with scepticism. 
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, the development of the north-du-Quebec resurgence, which the government has introduced Landry in 2001. 
According to her the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, decided not to use them. 
If they had done, 'we would be much more today', said Mrs Marois alongside their candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mer cure. 
The ADQ has argued, the adoption of a plan by the government to support north. 
"But what we want is that this is not only a great idea ', said the party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, come back from holiday today. 
letter-a Entehrtes country. 
Mr Vic Toews, ex - 'Justice' - Minister (the irony) the cabinet has led by, last summer, it was to say about Louise Arbour, it was a 'disgrace' for Canada. 
This woman who has led a never-ending battle for justice and all our admiration, to cover with opprobrium says as much about the people around the Prime Minister, as Stephen Parker. 
We are dealing with a government, which is the only for all the countries affected their Guantanamo prisoners in concentration camp compatriot has not taken home. 
A government that not even considered that Omar Khadr was still a young person, as the things happen, accused of him. 
The only government, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaking its word and a child soldier to languish in inhumane conditions. 
The only one who is reduced to a justice parody, to assess the guilt of the accused. 
Let us remember that especially UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers argue, Omar Khadr to get home, that he will get a fair trial in Canada. 
This is the government also closes its eyes to the torture: they are not interested, that a young adult after so many years of torment for will always be spiritually broken. 
We are not yet aware, but what we are witnessing is an insidious cut our rights, freedom and our 'democracy', this word, which by as a flag in front of it, and it sounds from his mouth so hollow. 
It is time, in which there is no longer any moral: a Canadian citizens arbitrarily abuse, torture and imprisonment of government, as they see fit, which is supported only by the minority (will he after 14 October in the minority ...). 
Many voters believe their salvation in a party that preach virtue, law and order. But they do not see that this government has broken from the what the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
The shame, Mr Toews, is in this Lossagung, and nowhere else. 
Free-the Orwellian speech of Barrick Gold 
in its edition on 17 September Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, deputy director-general of the Canadian Barrick Gold Mine gold. 
This confirmed, and in an Orwellian logic that the world's biggest gold profits of society a libel case over six million against three authors and a small Mittelloses publishing house, with the aim to open a public transparent debate. 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then you are not on the truth, particularly in the case of defamation complaints, but about the law. 
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed from Mr Garver. 
Barrick Gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, everybody in the ruin who dares to one of the opinions of their opposite. 
However, as the process, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money to prepare their defence and very unequal arms against an army of lawyers to fight to be paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine. 
The tactic of this unequal fight is also often, ruining the defenders, in order to force an amicable settlement, the silence the other side and also discourage any who dares to look again at the issue. 
If Barrick Gold really wanted to a public debate, she would have must present their view of things before the public opinion. 
In contrast, what works in many of the countries where Barrick Gold, and there is in Canada debates normally through the exchange of ideas, not Knüppelhiebe fought. 
So there would have been enough, if the gold mine open its books and files and would open a real debate, by the newspapers, media, publishing and financing independent audit team, bring the light in this issue. 
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in the public opinion and can the petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada aside with a hand. 
could Mr Garver explain how he can also ask for a public debate, but the views of this public scorn? 
Apparently the word in the world of vice-president the generous paid lawyers, and not the community all Canadians; a very good Beengte view of the term. 
In a democracy is the right to speak. Even slanderers 
Barrick Gold does not understand or does not wish to understand, is that the public that the authors and publisher of Noir Canada supports this especially because they oppose the brutal attitude of the gold mine. 
The public is ready to listen to Barrick and judgments, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not in a framework, the commission gave many-action (during the 'consequently debate, Barrick Gold has sent a request to the authors of Noir Canada, they asked, not to use this term ...). 
Apart from the surreal speech by Mr Garver, the case of Barrick Gold a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the truth, the fundamental for any democratic society. 
It denies totally right, credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations, which form the basis of the intellectual. 
If it is impossible in a country such as Canada, to discuss issues to investigate and, not like the rich in the world, who else can do? 
If Barrick Gold really wanted to a public and open debate, could this lead by the scientific standards, the authors of Noir Canada have been used. 
It has a right to respond. 
The university environment we belong, has long known, debates and inconsistencies in the control and to resolve conflicts. 
the disproportionate complaint of Barrick Gold shows that, contrary to what they claim, has no desire for an open debate. 
This is a loss for the university world, as it was for the public debate, and it is time that governments take measures to limit this type of unjustified actions. 
bailout for Wall Street Democrats and Republicans understand 
The Bush administration and the Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, yesterday were finally reached an agreement on the comprehensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
The new version of over $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months, must still be approved by the two chambers of Congress. 
The main content: a better control of members on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms, in order to secure the repayment of public funds, new orders, in order to curb the number of because of payments as housing, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to executives of the companies are. 
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and representative present in the negotiations of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day marathon negotiations.

"This is the key point: if we do not do this, the trauma, the chaos and unrest in the daily lives of Americans enormous', the Republicans Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, for fear of the impact of another failure on the mood of investors have had. 
The deadline was agreed, was the market opening this morning. 
The two American presidential candidates, the late involved in the negotiations, rather than supporters of the agreement, without fail, to express their discontent about that they must take in this extreme way. 
The Democratic senator bar rack Obama was on the addition of some orders for agreement, especially those that should enable the owners to keep their homes, and those that the salaries of senior executives of the rescued by state companies. 
' if the taxpayers asks, because the irresponsibility of some people to take extraordinary measures, that is not what we congratulate could. 
But these measures are necessary ', he said on the American television channels. 
When he was asked at another station, whether he will vote in favour of the proposed plan, said his Republican opponent John McCain: 'I would like to know the details, but I hope it. 
' The guidelines, which I have read, [show] that this is a matter that we will all need to digest and we can move forward. 
The option to do nothing, is simply not acceptable ", he said. 
The $700 billion plan is designed, with taxpayers' money 
It is 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble, which led to the collapse of the risky mortgage lending (SUB) first, before expanding to other forms used more bonds (PCAA), and finally, in a freezing the financial strength and in the ruin of banks and financial institutions. 
A group of Republican member, last week it was wrecked the first attempt to reach agreement. 
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of companies in trouble only by the government and should not be bought, believes the impasse escape. 
the perspective for all round in Congress, but we also added a decision, which says that if the government with this programme within five years of losses, they could then new taxes, reclaiming their investments. 
The new plan provides for an initial sum of 250 billion, in addition to the 100 billion, if the President considers it necessary. 
another 350 billion in a new vote must be passed by Congress. 
in return for his help, Washington shares in the companies, supported him in the case of win dividends, and it can sell, if the storm is taken over. 
The federal government will have the opportunity, the Pfändungsverfahren on housing, which are tied to the real estate loans affected by this plan, stop, and also set deadlines for repayment and the compensation to the executives of the companies involved. 
The developers of the plan would like to have that already voting on it today, the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate on Wednesday. 
Despite all their efforts is not yet sure that their plan will get the green light. 
Indeed, more votes yesterday rose up against this project, both Republicans and Democrats. 
' obviously understands Washington not ', the Republicans said Scott Garett, a member of the finance commission of the chamber, his constituents. 
' yes, we have a great financial problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not, which is to ask the taxpayers to pay '. 
The Democratic member Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress, the 'Kaukus the sceptics', the things differently, but the same conclusion. 
' four excellent economic professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to tell US: we ask the Congress, are not under pressure, and to consider carefully the path is', he said yesterday. 
At the same time, we in Europe once again proved that it is a global crisis. 
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion Euros (16.3 billion US dollars). 
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying their Konkurrentin, which is in big trouble, since 2 billion Euros ($2.9 billion) in the crisis by the risky home loans in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the ten largest insurers. 
"This is not lost money, said yesterday the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos. 
The compensation we can vote and influence in the Bank. 
This is exactly what the savers and households, now as uncertain times. ' 
During this time was on the other side of the channel, the British government, another of the financial crisis in route to nationalise Bank.

a decent man, in the true sense of the word. 
The death of Paul Newman's left the cinema lovers this weekend in infatuation, while on the dark screen memories happened all his major roles. 
More than a half-century of American film in constant change with him over.

Unlike several films, the early enough have withdrawn from the movie world, should Newman long stay in the saddle, and in Hollywood, his ability, his future and his concessions.

What has been produced in the factory of contract &amp; Co.? 
The negotiations start on October 8 in the criminal trial of János contract and his accomplices. 
The defendants, particularly in organised crime, and grossly negligent damage and business fraud and other criminal activities, including the counterfeiting of documents-accused. 
According to prosecutors, the from the tendering Lukrierten used for their own purposes, while the services often with fake bills. 
state funds and subsidies from the government-in HUF 65 million-partly in the coffers of the Organisation Baloldal FIA Valley and in the individual private funds flowed. 
As the investigation, were in the tender money fictitious invoices, and the clubs should also not their obligations. 
According to the indictment, a large part of the bills have been falsified. 
The blocks were on the market of Józsefváros bought, the around mark was in Kiskunhalas. 
The decision about what companies should be issued the bills, was decided on that tour north of Lake Balaton, István Lados sent from János award. 
In this "fact-finding tour" should find Lados pensions and restaurants. 
He asked bills on the Konsumationen later on these proposals based bills for the Youth and Sports Ministry, the social and labour ministry, and the management of Budapest issue. 
The majority of these bills should by István Lados and his accomplices, András ri manipulated, according to our information, the latter is responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports. 
One of the aims of Lados' "fact-finding tour" was a beer locally. 
As two of contract and carbon bills issued in 2003 is, the catering company the 90-member group of the club Biztos Pont Egyesület meal. 
But the head of the company, has such a large group had not fallen into the local at once. 
Another account, issued in the summer of 2002, the foundation Jobb Jövért, later known as purely a Harmadik Évezredért, has also serious form and content errors. 
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, only three rooms, and not more than 10 people can shelter at the same time, according to account should have contained 130 guests. 
the imagination of the counterfeiters were also not limits when it comes to the Pigal KFT., a catering business, in its accounting documents the customers Jobb Jövért and Hoppá according to prosecutor is not only points. 
As business leaders Gyz Farkas told the Hvg.hu, it was immediately clear that it was counterfeit documents, as the prosecutor during a consultation documents were presented. 
"Our firms name and the tax number were on the mark wrong appropriate". 
and: Apart from wrong form mistakes was the fact that the operation one hundred people home, after they have eleven rooms, the impossible so many people place. 
It is also on the bill restaurant mentioned, it is the restaurant for a long time no longer in operation. 
The inspired counterfeiters have also failed to check that the target in Budapest travel offers only travel abroad, and you Hungary travel on the cash account, which the company's accounting practice also denied. 
as during the course of the investigation became known, they also on the bills the VAT, although travel services, which relate to a country outside the EU, VAT free. 
The level of VAT was on four from the hotel Révfülöp KFT. The foundation Jobb Jövért issued bills wrong, since the company instead of 25 set off only 15 percent VAT, also issued by the staff exclusively mechanical bills, counterfeit documents, however, were handwritten. 
Another mistake, "Rechnungslegern" undermine, was that they were in a case 'transport "had stated as performance, although the company specialized in investment will not be offered, the prosecutor's office. 
Other form mistakes-false accounting format, false mark-was that the purely a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont issued bills could be exposed as forgeries. 
As in the case of Ravenna bt. and the sport camps Kunfehértó, whose business leaders protested, the bills never issued. 
The counterfeiters is another "mistakes" in the HIB KFT. from Nyíregyháza undermine: this society was at the time (2001), particularly in the FIA valley Városért dissolution, as the group Egyesület have been eating there-the mass administrators, therefore, the bills have not issued even. 
deliberately falsified 
The other group of accounting Leger, people who have been well aware that you fictitious accounts to. 
At the request of the FIA Baloldal valley-Ifjú Szocialisták, the foundation has Esély Budapestért Alapítvány bills for the foundation attempt a Harmadik Évezredért, issued to the tune of about HUF 4 million. 
According to the indictment, the chief executive of the Collab KFT. of one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, persuaded to issuing the fictional accounts. 
The currently also in liquidation, bio gate KFT. should have worked with grant and Co.: in 2003, the GmbH foundation Jobb Jövért Alapítvány, and the clubs Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny Egyesület with counterfeit bills in the total value of HUF 5 million care which is not provided services. 
However, there was also little payments as the bills immediately after their exhibition were cancelled, the affected in their documents have forgotten to note. 
The third group of accounting Leger covers people directly associated with the defendants. 
One of them is Iván Kubatov, The postman of the Ukrainian business leader of the Delta Trió KFT., in Budapest resident, but not to find real fuel-and vehicle trading company. 
The company is in the period from October to December 2005 several bills on the sale of computer components in the overall value of HUF issued around 18 million. 
According to investigative authority, since the 14 September 2005 in cash investment KFT is winding up. Kiskunhalas acts as buyers of these bills. 
Business leaders this company was a Romanian, the firms also Iván Kubatov documents should be delivered between 2002 and 2005. 
According to our information, Kubatov during the investigation, bills on behalf of the Atlasz GmbH and the clubs and Hoppá, and attempt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány issued and their value even cashed. 
The firms FA-Bani Jos Faipari KFT. and the Jos-investment bt. should of Romanian Bricklayers Iván Kubatovs explicit request was founded. 
In truth, however, was not active, which according to the accused was lack of contracts. 
However he could benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplices, prosecutor Zsolt Szente, with the preparation of the firms founding documents was instructed, he on behalf of the companies the bills issued clubs associated with contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció. 
as a whole, Kubatov 15 bills in the total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the cash investment firms, Delta Trió, FA-Bani Jos, Jos investment and Linaxtrade organisations issued. 
The state prosecutor believes that Kubatov each 10% of the amount and the VAT could have cashed. 
Kubatov, even the company Szi-far bt. for the exhibition of fictional accounts-in this case, the bills the nominations of Biztos Pont settled. 
The company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a modern Magyarországért in January 2006 their applications in the voluntary organisation of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA). 
each received 500,000 forints, but these sums have used inappropriately. 
This cover-up, they have the TMA five fictitious accounts of works team KFT. presented. 
These bills were also in the raid on the offices of Árpád Kemecsei in the education ministry. 
The negotiations, now of some defendants with a confession on the way of accounting fraud, as they have already been filing before the prosecutor,. 
This may be a sensation, if the main defendants János award to a full confession. 
His previous claims were less detail, and even though he had already promised on several occasions to report fully on everything, is the confession. 
So the question remains open, whether this is in its interests, the Socialists a pact with him on the compensation of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million and whether contract in return is ready to take on the responsibility. 
but it is quite possible that award is playing the "insulted", after his requests to mitigate the imprisonment and house arrest were falling on deaf ears. 
While other criminals, with economic crimes far greater damage and these have not paid, at large, or at least remains under house arrest, denied this opportunity. Premium 
the psychology of the Überbietens-or why we are prepared to pay more, 
at an auction, buyers tend to spend more and the Feilgebotene therefore exaggerate. 
neurologists and Economic Research at the University of New York, it is managed, the logical neuro-economic basis to discover the known and apparently irrational behavior. 
According to a "Science" magazine published study to the people in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, not beaten and are willing to pay high prices. 
Researchers have tried to the neurological system this "game" to explore with experimental auction. 
A group of volunteers should play lottery, while the other attended a play action-in both cases, the active Brain regions of the subjects through functional Magnetischer resonance (Fmri). 
Both could play the participants money win, but the increased activity of the Striatum, a complex below the Gehirnrinde, losers of the auction, which offer on the opponent plays a key role. 
Along with many other functions, this brain region responsible for the "reward" of the nervous system. 
Therefore, the researchers said the price increase by avoiding over-reaction of the Striatums explain. 
In order to maintain their thesis, the economists in the group of researchers further studies to follow the money. 
In this case, three groups against a partner under different conditions with. 
The control group was told the true value of the product, then they have their operations. 
Another group has also promised 15 dollar reward, for the case that the winners from the game. 
The third group was $15 before the auction, in the event of a lost game also were lost. 
The difference between the two groups was then simply that the emphasis in the one in the win, while the other was on the losing. 
as proof of the neurologists's hypothesis, but members of the "against the" Games group prepared to higher operations than those in the control-or "profit" group. 
"These results are from any previous economic theory. 
This is the behaviour observed in auctions so far only with the joy of the win, or risk prevention. 
The contradiction between these two theories, thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so we are now a third statement, "said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics Faculty of the University of New York. 
Hepatitis: when is the doctor? 
World around half a billion people suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C, and these chronic liver disease among the leading causes of death in Hungary lists. 
The number of infected is estimated at hundreds of thousands here, but with only seven thousand what is that patients often do not know that they are infected. 
Hepatitis is the collection of infectious liver disease, created by various viruses. 
The symptoms are often similar-liver inflammation and jaundice are often differ, but the agent and the diseases. 
depending on the virus spread the Hepatitis viruses on two different species: Hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, by contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses through blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, Scheidensekret or spittle). 
travellers, a vaccine against the virus A and B recommended any, C) there is no vaccine against the virus. 
The symptoms of Hepatitis a show about two-three weeks after consumption of contaminated food and generally uneasy, weakness, stomach pain and vomit. 
Then comes the jaundice on the skin and in the eyes of the chair, brightly urine darkness, and the cure can take up to two, three weeks. 
About 1 million people each year in the world dies caused by hepatitis B, far more serious diseases such as liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver. 
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected in drug treatment. 
Hepatitis C can have serious consequences: untreated can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. 
Most of the infected do not even know about their illness, and because the pathogen the liver cells subtle destroyed-in many cases the first symptoms after 20-30 years. 
It is timely prevention, such as regular inspections, is essential. 
There are three groups in which this disease often: those who have looked at before 1991 a blood transfusion, drug addicts, and Tätowierte. 
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide to 200 million. 
Since the disease during a routine investigation laboratory proven, it is advisable, at the first signs of unknown origin House doctor. 
time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, which the infection averted and prevent the development of cancer. 
The 30 September is the world of hepatitis patients in 2004 for the first time offices worldwide. 
The aim of the scheme, the awareness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, to strengthen their creation and the importance of early detection. 
believers have less pain? 
as recent research has shown that the religious believe as a kind of "pain" effect that should already have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs. 
The Oxford University scientists have an interesting experiment: it was investigating whether the belief in God the feeling pain of the people affected, reported the British newspaper "Telegraph". 
In the wake of the rather bizarre investigation ever received 12 believers and atheists electric shocks, while they studied a painting of the Mother of God. 
As the results showed, the believers could switch off most of the pain. 
Using a brain-scan technology could even be shown that Catholics could activate the part of your brain, which is responsible for the pain regulation. 
The investigation was the first in a research project, as well as scientists, philosophers and theologians of various departments in the university. 
The attempt was linked the subjects Funkelndes machine on the left hand, which the electric shocks. 
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: a picture of the Mother of God, painted of Sassoferrato, in the 17th century, and Leonardo da Vincis "lady with the Hermelin". 
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the believers would create a kind of religious trance, while you select Vincis picture, because it is not much different from other paintings and reassuring. 
The subjects spent the half an hour in an MRI scanner, and a total of 20 electric shocks, this time in four stages, while they either religious or other paintings should look. 
The Catholics reported that they had at the sight of the Mother of God "in safety" felt as if they "for" and had "calm and peace". 
During the Betrachtens religious painting you have about 12% less pain than if they Leonardos work. 
The psychologist Miguel far IAS, also attended the attempt, said, similar effects could also working with other strong images among atheists, we should also find just the photo. 
"We must find a picture, the very positive sentiments, such as a mother or father", the psychologist. 
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research. 
"The practice of the faith should change our personality, and in many cases it does," Wright. 
These excellent results, only the question of what effect a Madonna-picture Leonardos or other similar Malers on the pain regulation of believers. 
would the quality even better results? Virgin Mary 
You are what you on you Mitteilst 
At its tenth birthday, Google and right to say: It is in the pockets of the people as well, as their heads in the sky: You know where the people have spent their holidays, the doctors they go and what they moved. 
and that is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google. 
in direction, the host be plagued by Orwellian nightmare visions, he is: these were just the essence of the Web 2.0. 
In an interview with the Financial Times said Schmidt recently, the main aim of Google, more personal data about users to collect and so closer to the original purpose of the company, which they wanted to "all information of this world order". 
Schmidt said Google was after ten years of world changing work is still only at the beginning of the information collection. 
Asked after the status quo in five years, Schmidt: he wanted, Google would be able to questions like "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what job is really me?" to answer, but software programs are not yet in a position to do this, because they do not know enough about the users know. 
Not all Internet users are aware that their Internet-research the Suchbegriffe registered, and IP addresses, which sought, and visited the sides. 
For example, the two years ago introduced "personalized search" allowed the visitors to retain its own Suchverlauf and later using them, so the hit later can be generated much more precise, and based on the same logic, the so-called "recommendations" which tailor products and services due to the previous system preferences. 
The users are asking what happens in the event of a data abuse - "if you look what I" - show some concerned whether the Google monopoly. 
In most cases, it is rather the potential power, represented by the firm that terrifying, and less the sense of guilt or fear of punishment, the quest for freedom or the rebellion against the power of many Internet users is rejected. 
It is, however, a proven fact that the Suchbegriffe stored not only, but in a case in third, and in these cases, there is no protection for the personal rights of Internet users. 
a perfect example was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, which Google the Brazilian government information, the community site called Orkut ", and also to identify the Pädophilien. 
personal rights concerned users, but relief in May, as Google, along with the civil rights organization EFF successfully against took the FBI to court: so Google May in future with no point of the constitution be forced on secret information the FBI question. 
(the federal government has successfully the 50,000 Web addresses and 1,000 Suchbegriffen, referring to the years ago adopted youth protection law has been obtained, but the list of individual users, or their Web-and search term list retroactive to two months.) 
Google's image remains controversial: those who like their personal data, because the use of Google services fear the loss of their private and privacy, scourges of the company with the conservative performing firms due indignation. 
However, the American "Geek culture" which is present in many countries and enthusiastic computer fans, activists and unites users, the next generation of "Coolen entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, thanks to Windows is market leader, even if both fighting for the same goal. 
One possible reason for this is that Google its users, unlike Microsoft no identification codes required, and its services free of charge, so an open, constantly updated source code and programme-package far more attractive, young people and appear to be cool, the official practices of the software giant. 
On the other hand, says the Geeks of the problematic relationship of individual rights and the Internet Messerscharf-a relationship, particularly in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0" in the focus. 
The "Web 2.0" is nothing more than collaboration, in other words, the user deliberately lane and use the available channels of communication, and if the size vary individually, remains the main thing the same, namely to show public. 
an ordinary young people can manage at the same time, several community portals profile-from Facebook on Xanga, this with other services, such as twitter or music services such as last. FM combine, and all this is finally in a follow-up system such as Friendfeed or blip. FM. Furthermore, can you blogs, the latest photo galleries automatically to Flickr and Picasa Geostet. 
and a number of other classic cases shows: looking at last night's party photos will take place as soon as the friend, with whom your disloyal friend rubbing, or the staff will be dismissed because he only too honest in his blog his anger over the management of air power, one thing is certain: the word "privacy" has now been completely new. 
who leads an online life, is what it of price is in around the basic idea could be behind the behaviour of today's youth. 
and anyone who tries to keep something secret or even the Google monopoly, can do so-such as Scroogle, a tool, which is on the Google search engine wide, but deliberately leaves no trace. 
Few people register deliberately not at community parties, so that they are nowhere, but also the Google online applications, such as word processor and Grafische tools and RSS feeds, deal with alternative versions, which are linked to a huge Server parks and therefore not generate the best profile the users. 
The public opinion however spellbound waiting until Google shows its true colours. 
with its current value of $156 billion, the company even IBM (140 billion USD), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), the advertising area Adwords and AdSense threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, and the faster services not only Microsoft introduced, but also other software headache. 
However, critical viewers find the disturbing polarities: for example, the group rejected a protest by the staff completely after the charges for its own nursery have been doubled, also said the management of the various restaurant staff is costly. All this but seems mild about Google in 2006 before the Chinese government even in the knees and with an agreement was that all regime critical hit, or those who violate the good taste, filtered out.

The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers 
in the increasingly serious devoted to international financial crisis comments languages on Tuesday some leading European newspapers the "second September 11". 
The global financial disaster, thanks to the American President, said some "La Repubblica" - the president was not even in the situation, his own party for the draft law behind them, the relief in the appalling situation should ... 
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as billions investor Warren Buffett has said, it would be appropriate to talk of a "second September 11". 
Parts of the press in Madrid places the scapegoat also in Washington. 
According to the "El Mundo" is the lack of blame political leadership that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse. 
The American financial system is always more collapse, and including the whole world suffer. 
Bush's plan was not perfect, now but after the vote in Congress the threat that Washington has no political tool to a crisis management. 
The world economy is in the air, and comes at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism. 
We can no longer ignore the threat, says the Geneva "day scoreboard". 
Although some states could still banished their embattled financial institutions rescue packages available, and the banks with the taxpayers' money saved from bankruptcy. 
However a domino effect and that more banks go bust, then help further injections or other emergency measures. 
In the long term, the EU member states on their instincts and centralise control on the money markets. 
On Monday alone, paid out more than 100 billion of faltering financial institutions, the Vienna "standard". Also, the newspaper, are becoming more and more realistic's concerns that the Americans are now the European taxpayers something deeper into their pockets to emerge from the crisis. 
So far the EU has not seriously with the crisis, the now as a tsunami sweeps on the old continent. 
The "savior" should not immediately wagging several hundred billion Euros "", but it would be advisable to note, in which case it would be wise, dealing with taxpayers' money, in order to avoid an even greater damage. 
intelligent car imitate the flight of the Hummel 
what is the best way to develop new technologies to accident prevention, if not the obstacle-sensors from the natural to imitate? 
For example, the bees. 
presented at the Ceatec Japan was an astonishing project, in which the Nissan-engineers of Hummeln in creating new accident avoiding systems were inspired. 
In cooperation with the Tokyo University, Nissan's car Biomimetische Robotern managed system of the type Br23c built a mini-car, equipped with the properties of bees, with the aim to support the development of a system that avoids any collisions. 
Air is any bee their own Oval "privacy", is very similar to our own "Shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology-Pr and research and development, in the exhibition. 
The eye of the bee together, it in every direction and a corner of about 300 degree can see games play an important role. 
The role of the composite eye, the researchers the idea of laser-controlled distance knife. 
It identifies obstacles in the Br23c in a field of 180 degree within 2 metres, their distances and sends signals to the Mikroprozessor board, the collision avoided process immediately. 
The barrier will be registered in a split second, and the car robots immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of bees, by the Tyre revolves around the corner. 
Unlike previous systems will take place this manoeuvre purely instinctively. 
"If it were not so, the car robots could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the laboratory "mobility" and the car robots-project. 
The system needs to respond immediately and instinctively, because the technology the heart and most vulnerable part of the shield-a class, within the accidents are as inevitable. 
The entire process must reflect the behaviour of the bees, if they avoid other bees. 
and that must be the fraction of a second. 
However, the duck, unlike bees, not up, down, or even Diagonal-it can only be two, and only in the Wendbarkeit of tyres. 
While the Bees are infinitely many opportunities to other bees to avoid, robots, researchers from the car only the hub of the movement, or of speeding up and Abbremsens. 
The Br23c contains lithium-polymer batteries, the easier and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer life than conventional lithium-ion Enbatterien. 
Andoh said, it is the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of data, and even less to the ability to store them. 
This device, only a few inputs per second process and react accordingly. 
It must not store, or on previous manoeuvres an intuitive, logical response produce, so that there are just a handful of KB takes memory. 
There is no need for gigabits-and megabyte-serious memo Ries. 
This is the first step in the development of the immediate Collision Avoidance technology, according to Nissan series will be moderate in production within the next ten years. 
Another application could find the technology in the GPS satellite navigation, by the drivers deliberately around obstacles and his destination. 
a name for the Sündteure child 
Now the written version of the 700-billion-dollar rescue package-law that will apply in several stages and the purchase of bad loans from the banks. 
In the first round, half the money is to be spent. 
In a session, which ended after midnight local time on Saturday east coast, the Congress after several debates to reach agreement on the 700-billion-dollar heavy rescue package warts, reported Reuters news agency. 
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president in the US House of Representatives, and said that the agreement only on paper. 
The compromise on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the outcome: the programme will be effective and efficient, but we need to do more. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but the helm of the economy Rumzureißen. 
The written version of the package before the opening of markets in Asia, and Washington time Sunday evening at 8 p.m. (central European time Monday 2 a.m.), published, but has no soaring on the stock. 
On Monday, the first house on the draft law to stabilise the economy in 2008, then the Senate to the series. 
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi, on Saturday evening and the White House welcomed the news of the agreement. 
We are satisfied with the progress made in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House. 
The programme, however, the Bush administration's original recommendation that the $700 billion to purchase bad, with loans contaminated Securities should be spent. 
In a first tranche, maximum half of the 700-billion-amount be spent, with 250 billion available immediately after the congress will vote on the issue on Monday as expected. This amount will be used to purchase credit strain, bad securities, and on the other to USD 100 billion the president. 
The programme will be reviewed by an independent commission, also the president of the Federal Reserve. 
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision of Congress. 
In the spirit of the law the Treasury can use a combined tactics: it is also bad loans, mortgages, mortgages and securities purchased, or other "toxic" loans. 
as responsible persons of the ministry reported, the purchase both in an auction, and directly. 
The law allows the companies to take part in an insurance programme, in which the Treasury guarantee the worrying resources, and the companies are expected to damage the charges. 
Henry Paulsen said: the law defines the resources so that up to 700 billion dollars in emergency aid for the American financial system can be made available, whether for the large-scale purchases worse, their insurance, or avoiding a systemic risk that is triggered by the collapse of a major money Institute. 
We have the necessary steps so that we are prepared to introduce the law when it was signed, so Paulson. 
The leaders in difficulty and now reliant on government aid banks can however expect that their-handling, the overseas-slang colloquial "golden handshake", cut by the government. 
Reducing the salaries will only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury from helps. 
The reduction basically means that if the ministry under a buying auction, the "golden handshake" is taxed, unless the outgoing head of banks is being pushed into the pension. 
In the case of a direct purchases of bad loans, the government aggressively involved to ensure that the managers' salaries not be exaggerated. 
The picture is that the existing golden handshake-contracts are not changed-the restrictions only pertains to new agreements, so that the more people take part in the programme. 
This is the first case in American history that cuts in managers-salaries by law, the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the finance committee, the measure. 
The State participation in the participating banks, so that the risk to taxpayers is falling because they can participate, as soon as the economy and also rescued the Bank recovers. 
The draft law stipulates that the president of the Congress needs to make a proposal in the next five years, as the taxpayers should receive her back money lost from the financial sector. 
However, there were on both sides, in relation to the plan have expressed their doubts. 
That is not what the American people expect us to protect the plan no taxpayers' money, the California Republican Darrell Issa. 
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: the measures were driven by the same people, which are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

The eras break is also a problem of the Christian Democrats, as well as for Angela Merkel. 
not surprising was the disaster of CSU, but on Sunday is something, what is already quite exactly 10 years ago emerged: the undoubted hegemony for a state party 
Ten years ago, 1998, ends the CSU in 47.7 percent and fell for the first time since the 1950s under the 50-percent mark 
The repeated three years ago at the Bundestag 2005 elections, the famous Stoiber era.

sociologists have already predicted 40 years ago-but the pace significantly miscalculated. But without could impact the secularization, the educational achievements, the recruitment of eastern and northern German in the prosperous regions Bavaria on the loyalty of the CSU voters remain. 
modernisation is always accompanied with options increase. And this has political consequences. 
The rights camp is intact-only voters within the camp were critical and willing. 
It is striking that in recent weeks classic citizens groups the greatest distance to the CSU said: the professions, the commercial citizenry and voters with level equivalents as graduates.

Járóka: the vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken 
In Paris the European summit on equal opportunities today has started, this year the EU presidency country France. 
In her speech to the House, Mrs Járóka, Fidesz members of the European People's Party, in particular attention to educational segregation, since this is one of the most serious rights violations, the Roma children and also is the biggest obstacle for the extended need. 
The high-level conference, the French social and Employment Minister Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU commissioner for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities. 
Among the participants were representatives from governments, the European social partners, as well as the main European legal protection and civil organisations from the equal opportunities. 
As the press office of the Fidesz MEPs, has Járóka pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in the purpose, the Roma primarily because of their low levels of education would be excluded from the labour market. 
"The vast majority of Roma-young people has no secondary school education and a bad primary education is only a small part of a university degree". 
Járóka also stressed that education is a basic human right, a key role to play in the leveraging of other human rights. 
Investment in the early education of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU member states. 
The members believe it is important that this links a broader constituency-Roma and non-Roma-aware. 
because the sooner a Roma pupils the school, the increase his chances, to be a productive member of the labour market; and income and sales tax their contribution to the national expenditure. 
"as citizens, the Roma must be secured the right to quality education-the poor and Segregierte teaching must be stopped" - Mrs Járóka. 
as she said, is a common objective and action-oriented approach the European Union needed to speed up to Desegregationsprozess education. This is the correct application of the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives. 
"We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and Roma children democratic opportunities, to the future of Europe as full citizens", called Járóka.

CSU: mercy on time. 
At the end of October will determine the fate of the fallen duos Huber, Beckstein decided 
Despite the election debacle roles still no heads, the head of the Bavarian CSU was postponed the staff debates. 
Erwin Huber leader and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the only question is how long this mercy. 
The fate of the tandems after the disastrous 17 -% vote loss is on weekend at the extraordinary congress decided last October. 
The much Gescholtene duo, but says that it is not to put on their bellies. 
They want to appease the angry group and the party base, the day after the "Bavarian tsunami" with the loss of an absolute majority personal consequences. 
Five years ago-admitted, under the leadership of the height of his career, Edmund Stoiber, the Christian Social Union, 60.7 percent. But now, one year after the coup against Stoiber they were 43.4 percent of the vote. 
The CSU was 46 years' only direction "in Bavaria, the 18 percent of GDP. 
The Conservatives are the dominant force in the Hungarian economy for the important southern province, but will need to govern in a coalition. 
The first sign of party internal restructuring is the potential successors Hubers, vice-president and federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer, involved in the fact-finding team, with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "free voters" exploratory talks on a possible coalition in Munich. 
It is an irony of fate that, with the list of "free voters" those Gabriele Pauli in the legislative stone, whose anti-Stoiber the Huber, Beckstein duo exploited first, then the Abzuservieren ruthlessly determined politician. 
The CSU leadership now focus all their forces to the stabilisation Becksteins. 
in the transition process, Stoiber has been pulling the strings from behind the scenes, an active role. The former Prime Minister and chairman of CSU called the 28 September "bitter day his political career". 
On Monday, a few toxic comments towards CDU Huber-its view, deserves much more support from the sister party CSU. 
Other CSU-politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and to Angela Merkel. 
the CSU, the 2005 has contributed much success at national level, not a common effort back on its feet, Merkel can be chancellor after the German elections in September 2009. 
Merkel, of their disappointment at the fiasco has made no secret, believes that the loss of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin. 
But relatively: the injured CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats, however. 
with 18.6 percent, the SPD her best result so far in Bavaria since 1946. 
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0 
in the elections on Sunday, a member of the opposition in the Ukrainian parliament. 
Russian observers say that this is the prosperity and stability in the country, led by Alexander Lukashenko, the OECD suspected illegality in the counting of votes. 
The OECD, which has 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections. 
The legislature of the 10-million-person state is for decades without opposition. However, the under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) rallied against party before yesterday's elections seriously hoped that Lukashenko, the flawed elections and a constitutional amendment 2006 presidential mandate for the fourth time renewed, this would "allow" some members of the opposition in parliament. 
That is why the ODS even abandoned the previously planned boycotts. 
Ukraine, thanks to the rising prices at the gas import more dependent on Russia economically always. for the relief of price increases were even borrowed, and the country has also the sale of Beltransgas, owner of the country leading gas pipeline, the Russians agreed. In the background of the expectations of the opposition, the hope, Ukraine wants to improve its relationship with the EU, after Lukashenko and other senior politicians because of the classified as anti-democratic political system in the EU have a travel ban. 
for a temporary relaxation, the OECD's assessment report of the elections, in which the more emphasis on positive movements, rather than on the shortcomings-such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections-was. 
However, the OECD report quickly on Monday of the campaign-therefore opposition should not in the press-and in particular the fact that the opposition was not present at the counting of votes. 
Despite all the opposition can see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released in Minsk, and is even smaller confrontations with Moscow prepared, by continuing the recognition of the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia denied, although Russia, Ukraine a federal state on paper, the two regions as independent. for a month 
"We have two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Russia and the EU has started," said Alexander Milinkevich to our story. 
According to the opposition candidate in the presidential elections of 2006 is a continuation of desirable, although "the powerful fright, only a opposition in parliament". 
The opposition plans protest measures in view of the results, but rather trying the need for economic reform to voters. 
"We have many problems-the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the obstacles in the way of local authorities are in distribution, but yet I see that more and more people are supporting the change, even the older, Milinkevich said in reference to that not even the most support section of the pensioners agreed with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit production is Social Security. 
"Thanks to the debt of the country and the rise in the trade deficit, it is just a matter of time until the quiet of a peaceful court Gemahnende" social security "will crumble," Milinkevich. 
Unlike the opposition politicians have Russian observers described the elections as democratic. 
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the news agency RIA Novo graphic: "People think the deeds, and not words" and the lack of opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of the White Russian voters. 
Brunetta: "from now on, the work breakfast" 
for the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there is the visible doors for the A-and exits of officials. 
Today, the measure against those clever Meier in force, the only label and then during the working time coffee. 
The new "anti-fur lazy-law" was Renato Brunetta today, the minister for public administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.

The officials said there was no resistance, the Secretary-General: "this process was supported by all the cooperation came from all sides". 
All in all, there are now no breakfast during the working time more; coffee and croissant.

He adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of public administration in Italy 
"wage dynamics-so the minister-were in the last 8-10 years twice as large as the private sector and well above the rate of inflation". 
In the meantime, thousands of officials joined forces to the Brunetta decree within the framework of the supported by Codacons appeal to counter. 
"While the minister for public services, with figures on lower profile Absenzen at work-writes the consumer Central-the people of working 'lazy' continuously. 
In fact, thousands of accurate and valuable officials of the public service together so that the standards of the decree to explain the war. " 
In particular, the regional administrative court (TAR) for additional financial compensation for work-related disease fought; so are the planned extension of the mandatory confinement of patients Arbeiternehmers, during which can be made checks and other aspects of the innovations of the minister challenged.

Napolitano is not that "in any case there is also a resource problem: it must be vital investment in education and information." 
A special significance, the many initiatives for developing more directly aware in school by the young people who feed the world of work. 
It is our duty to draw attention to this phenomenon and not divert from his social seriously. We must be a legislative standard in force and improve. 
its, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini said "as the phenomenon of work-related deaths was an urgent social emergency, which insulted the conscience of us all and obliges all institutions, strong work rules, whose aim is to put an end to the problem". 
"The data seem to indicate a slight improvement workplace accidents, this does not, however, that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," said President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We do not want this" positive trend "means less attention and that caused the tragedy." 
"How do that in fact does too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents. We can fight by various actions. 
Our view that greater controls and inspections are needed-Mercandelli, but stronger measures to educate the workers, in the school start ". 
"A further effort is needed, he said, as the communications and the awareness of public opinion. 
Above all, however, is a bigger responsibility on the part of the employer a phenomenon which is a social emergency, asked ". 
Mercandelli had also "the gradual deterioration of protection for the workplace accident victims' and denounced the" abolition of the social system, which we fight in recent years ". 
"The objective is therefore, the workers a guarantee to back insurance so that the fate of the victim of work not voluntary or accidental donations, which are decided by a legislator from time to time, will depend on". 
MP3 player accused: risk of hearing damage 
Loud Music on a longer period with portable music devices, such as MP3 players, to hear, can lead to permanent hearing damage. 
This warns the European Commission, which in a report widely used today in Brussels the opinion of the Csrseri (scientific committee on the current and recently identified health risks) quoted the EU. 
"From the report says, in a comment-it is clear that 5-10% of the week for at least five years longer than an hour a day hear loud music with portable music devices, the permanent loss of their hearing risk". 
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people usually portable music devices and mobile phones on a high-volume, heard her without knowing irretrievably damage", Meglena Kuneva. 
"from the scientific-as it is on the part of the EU shows a clear risk to act quickly. 
What really counts, it is the consumer awareness and to make the information public. 
We need to reconsider in light of these scientific evidence the existing control systems so that they are completely effective and keep pace with new technology ". 
Brussels the independent scientific committee had given the widespread use of portable music devices among young people. 
"The scientists-includes the communication of EU confirm that it is right to be concerned and that the EU Commission, together with the other EU members and stakeholders will now investigate the necessary measures for children and young people better before the noise, the portable music devices and similar equipment to protect". 
There is already a European standard at the moment, the level of noise of portable music devices on 100 decibels limited. The concern about the damage that could come from a major noise pollution. 
The damage can be very limit, in the it solutions, such as the reduction in the volume and the length of the noise suspension. 
In its report, the EU scientific committee points out that if the users of portable music devices only five hours a week loud (louder than 89 decibels) music, so that the legal limits, are already exceeded the maximum noise levels in the workplace. 
Those who music the border crossing, risking the complete loss of hearing within five years. 
This is so 5-10% of users of such equipment, estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU can be estimated. 
Roma, Alemanno is starting to "Commission for the future of the city" 
We should start today, in March's review will be over in June. 
This is the end the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the future of the capital Rome. The commission has this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla Thermen. 
in six months, the president Marzano and the other 49 members of the commission the leading lines to Rome. 
As soon as the project will be completed, the city and the town's analysis and evaluate projects, in June in the situation, the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Kapitols and to be able to present the Lord Mayor Gianni Alemanno oversight. 
"The commission is fully independent and all political, social and cultural views are represented in her," said Alemanno. "It will for a development plan for Rome's proposals, the political leaders of the city-and the town. 
There is no redistribution of powers, only the will to have a place where we can develop a great project for Rome. 
In March, their task will be completed and the commission will back away, as a project must have a certain end. 
In June, announced the mayor-we will present the strategic plan, in which we will use the work of the Commission ". 
If the commission's competence in question, because their view Ermangele binding, reciprocated Alemanno: "everything depends on the work of the commission and the quality of their proposals. 
If you, as in France, the Attali-commission, quality results-and this will certainly be the case in Rome-their contribution will be fundamentally. 
too often the policy with the day-to-day problems and emergencies that occur from time to time. 
We, however, want a longer period of time, so in a deeper perspective seriously in the development of Rome and the future of the city ". 
The Mayor of Rome is very keen to clarify "this is neither a useless body, nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will cost the Rome citizens no cents and will reflect. It will be the best minds of the capital". 
Alemanno said "it is necessary to have a strategic plan, which is neither static nor hermetically, our city a qualitative leap-they really necessary-and a common step in the future". 
A future, the mayor of Rome, "not only in the current municipal borders, but will look much further," not only for the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as a future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean. " 
Obama, the first anti-American President? a statement 
A well-known American politicians, which is keen to be seen as independent, wrote: "Barack Obama, the second anti-American president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, with his decisions, the US economy depleted and with the Befeindeten Islam relations used (and even today as a private citizen does) ". 
The attacks on Obama will increasingly violent, now, where the elections. 
A lady in Miami, wrote in an Internet page: "this person is full of ambitions. 
Obama is very brazenly: he thinks it will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators! ". 
not much to say these attacks, however; it is racist attacks and they cannot answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; all say that Obama will win with a large margin. 
In this case, people because, with the heart and not talk to the head. 
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: only in the election booth will we know who the real American Patriot his voice. 
This is a mentality of the US to light, until the hidden. 
"Say what you want, then we will decide, for whom we will make our Kreuchen, whether for Obama or McCain". 
There are people, the swear: If Obama wins, we will emigrate from America. 
something never before heard-only now, where the success of the black candidate seems so sure. 
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush. 
1500 people were asked: what mistakes Bush committed during his term? 89% replied: the war in Iraq. 
America is changing. 
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kicks in the butt back. 
500 soldiers have lost their lives in Iraq, and the Americans were not forced. 
Still, Iraq remains for the majority of the weak point of Bush. 
The person who will take his place, faces a huge challenge. 
The USA. The financial collapse leaves behind his scars and journalists: can feel the cuts in the newspapers. and many accuse the Internet, "murderers" of the press. 
five hundred American journalists by the Pew Research Center on their situation and their mental control concerning the future. 
Today, almost all journalists pessimistic about their future. 
Nevertheless said to the information on relevant not really concerned about the overall credibility. 
They do not feel as alone as before. 
The problem for American journalists is the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for this journalist is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed. 
The big problems by the news room taken cuts, the area in which the editors work, the newspaper. 
It is a problem that must be resolved-the interview ten journalists-if we are to prevent the traditional journalism, as the big audience understands it, not much is shrinking. 
A clear, but complicated pessimism met the American journalist. Today 
Six of 10 journalists and executive seniors press are of the opinion that the journalism at national level is on the wrong track. 
The local area in the executives even the 65%. 
Print vs. broadcasting. 
It is not difficult to imagine for the journalists, in what direction the Web. 
The main publishing groups lined the road on the Internet, that many regarded as the "killer" of the press. 
The "economic pressure", the journalists, has risen by up to 79 percent. 
The 500 interview ten journalists have admitted to join the new technology to the hope "something good for journalism". 
The biggest rift in the American journalism today between the editors of the news room and the reporters who work for them. 
56% of editors at national level, sure, your reporters share their values with them, while there is only 23% at local level. 
Some think that it has to do with the "job security '. 
The manager, the fear, to lose their work within three years, 47% at national level. 
The journalists are 30%. 
The issue of "safe work" in the team (our editors', ANM. D. red.) is always a hot topic in the United States. 
Only 13% of the journalists work under contract. 
In a vast nation, such as the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and television channels and Internet operators, the employers offer as you like and there will be a question of take it or leave it. 
The editors, very often very high wages, the editor can sometimes only 10000 Euros per month, pension and insurance funds. 
As for the holiday, so the complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 vacation days after a certain number of years. 
But the American journalists, as you say, in the course of the year often "sick". 
It is a question of climate. 
Unipol: Court in Rome, Dan ILO cop Pola remains in Grottaferrata 
The president of the second criminal chamber of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rina Mr, has decided to reject the request of the real estate broker. This had asked to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome. 
It will be the cop for Red Bank under the investigation about the agreement in the case of the takeover by Unipol-BNL. identified. 
During the process against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was in a residence duty in Grottaferrata converted. 
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the estate agents of the provincial town to be moved to an apartment in the capital. 
According to the court could such transfer it (against which the prosecutor had) the opportunity to influence its society and accusing him of evidence. 
The elite is in danger 
The phenomenon had already demonstrated a few days ago, when the House of Representatives against the 700 billion dollar savings package the White House agreed: a big part of the Americans and is more interested in punishing the Wall Street than to save the economy. 
This confirmed yesterday's edition told the New York Times, which, as the crisis over the Republican party divisions, increasingly divided in their old and moderate east coast-soul, always the state institutions and the business community placements and the neo-conservative, "in Washington," and the financial world is hostile and fifth in the south and the centre of the States electorate. 
This part of the party owes his rise fifth of voice, I mentioned above. 
This just mentioned example is only a small part of the major changes to the current economic earthquake or even: not only in the United States, throughout the West-and perhaps even beyond this will be affected by this. 
in both states, as well as in Europe the crisis seems to speed up the long feared events, which under these new conditions finally shape and come to light. 
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the extraordinary Renaissance of the state in connection with a sort of renationalisation of the economy. 
In fact, the crisis a decline of banking and financial institutions, the close links to the outside world and also a huge amount of assets of private households manage, live in a single state. 
This is a direct political problem for the governments: as it to behave towards the affected families, what a huge mass voters. 
The crisis is so global economically, politically it is almost purely national. 
The political internationalism seems to be isolated is in and his speech to have lost: the obvious evidence of this has been given by the EU, because its division into different national and international conflicts to find a common path. 
So now all with the intervention of the state; rescue plans, new rules, and V. A. distribution of aid funds: since the crisis is serious, only the US economic situation to save without foreign aid. 
and the resources they have also the legitimacy of using them: two not judgmental conditions, under certain circumstances, on what otherwise is not an international organisation and no market similarly recourse. 
The new emphasis on the state National element is perfectly compatible with the ever-increasing importance on, the recently in the economy is associated with an intimately related sector: the Territoriality. 
Paradoxically, it is now, as we were so convinced, long in a networked total-occurred in an increasingly different technologies, of the intangible, that we need to see, as our future but will always depend more on the essential material things: water, harvesting and oil. 
All of these can certainly be transported from one place to the other in the world, but nevertheless extremely closely with a specific piece of earth-a territory. 
Why is the one who has such a territory, another, in a Ernteertraglosen, Wasserlosen or oil-free area lives, the advantage. 
that brings me to the second innovation, requires a brief digression. 
Anyone who territory and government who policy says, saying leadership. 
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two complementary phenomena. 
On the one hand there is the knowledge that need strong leader ships, the need for someone who knows how things. 
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation about the current leaders, including those of the economy, which have zones as inadequate and full shadow arrangement. 
In addition, a deep-reaching and in some ways even more worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, impatience, a picture of futility, a sense of distance, all on a whole class of managers of the western countries. 
It seems so convinced in large parts of the population in the way that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but their ideas world, their way of life, culture in the broadest sense of the word, are, whose salary the majority than others and outdated. 
The demand for leadership so feeds bury a diverse but powerful movement the removal of the leaders and the traditional political establishment. This translates into unplanned "revolts" of voters and the sudden reversal of collective mood of the last time, starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, on the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, the American members rebellion against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also plays a role here). 
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value of what today in lower social strata of the West, and reinforced by the financial crisis and on dimension tied up. 
In view of all this, simply it would be excessive to talk of a "mass rebellion". 
But the eyes wide open, is however there is not. 
The Superkleber, walls up 
to defeat the forces of gravity thanks to a Klebstoffes and climb walls high as Superman. 
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which is now seems to be almost reached the objective. 
with a in an area of just 2.5 Qcm disgruntled Kleber, the researchers have succeeded, a 100 kg serious body fixated on a tightening right wall. 
The studio-an American magazine, has the results of researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force research laboratory published. 
The material devised by the team of researchers is a further development of already used glues, what a special carbon structure, called carbon-Nanoröhrchen, use. 
"The principle of Klebers can, as a number to a batch of spaghetti members present tubes", said Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists were inspired by the feet of Geckos, which are covered in microscopic's Härchen a perfect, the animal. 
with various materials like glass Teflon and abrasive paper tests have shown that the new Kleber is ten times more than the ability of the feet of reptiles and at the same time "easily can be removed from the wall," Liming Dai, researchers in the school of engineering at the University of Dayton. 
moving walls along? "the material could be used as a deciduous glue", Liming Dai. 
around as Spiderman to walls,? Perhaps, but the researchers think rather use a less fascinating, such as electrical equipment, because the Nanoröhrchen are as head of heat and electricity. 
other purposes could fall in the field of space. 
For the moment, the super-hero must wait. 
The other form of research, including the University of Berkeley, California, to a new Kleberart. 
In an article in the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists a glue from micro-fibres such as hair movement on a surface clean even the dust and it always a perfect liability. 
medicines: never play with fruit juice. 
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice. 
These drinks, because of their refreshing quality and their vitamin wealth V. A. consumed in the summer, serious health damage if they can also be taken with certain vital medicines, since they are to the inclusion of the body in extreme way. 
David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly in the risk packed as fresh fruit juices in combination with medications. Within the framework of the 236. meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, once again warning: it is a glass of grapefruit juice or Apple, orange, the capacity of some vital medicines to reduce that this practice will be eliminated and the health of patients at risk. 
Grapefruit juice was suspected to be responsible for, the effects of some medicines like antibiotics, anti-Asthma Tika, cardiovascular drugs, Anxiolytischer and neurological funds to toxic levels. 
Drugs in risk-the same agency the product in a report two years ago warned doctors and patients about the risks of this mix, and stressed to ensure, in conjunction with resources such as Diazepan or Metadon drunk. 
It is not only grapefruit-According to the experts, orange and apple juice substances which can hamper medicines. 
The list of fruit juices Gehemmten active is long. 
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, the director of the Università Statale Di News: "The results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturer, which it is free to change the consumer information. 
Therefore, it is recommended that always read the instructions and, if ambiguities still exist, not afraid to ask a pharmacist or doctor ", said the expert the Ansa agency. 
Economic Nobel Prize to Paul Krugman 
The economic Nobel prize is the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity. 
The 55-year-old Krugman is a neo-Keynesians, teaches at the University of Princeton and known for his regular article for the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the economic and foreign policy of the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman said in an editorial in the New York Times, this second event was crucial for the history of the United States as the attacks. 
a prediction, not a little controversy in response, and the economists years later held, but is proving quite right. 
"I am surprised and shocked how quickly the memory of the within the framework of the collapse of Enron or WorldCom scandals have disappeared from the public attention, Krugman said at the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi by the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank is Krugman a "economist of great value", but also a Banalisierer with a "very aggressive style, particularly against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government." 
Open Office, it seems the third version of the "anti-Microsoft" package 
The date of publication of Openoffice.org 3.0 is; the open source software as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office an ever greater number of users, both at home and in the office, both for free and in public administration. 
After a year of intense work by the voluntary developers, which is monitored by Sun Microsystems, presented the new open office now with some new audience: in addition to a revised and now Sparta path start menu, is now a reason to ensuring compatibility with Apple's Mac OS X operating system, and support for the new Odf (open document format) 1.2 format, so the latest standard ISO version. 
Eight was also on the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (. Docx,. Xlsx. Pptx) can be read by open office. 
interesting are some new features, such as those allowing, to reduce the size of power point presentations, for example, send via email easier. This includes the possibility PDF files in graph handling modules to import and also to preserve the original image of the side. 
So now "hybrid" PDF files generate, what the typical diagram of the Adobe-format to the elements of a table and a text processing system. 
The cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be dealt with Mehrhändig of various users, thereby avoiding conflicts in changes; in the case of the text processing system, each with a Frabe allocated to guarantee a better correction procedures. 
Some companies are different functions of open office to publish on the internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the definitive result should be made public. 
The Italian version is available on the following link to download: Http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Consequently, the English version, which mirrors. since Friday 
The programme is for Windows and Mac OS is also available for the Linux operating system. 
question is the installation CD to send them home or at the office. 
However the cost to an incentive for the distribution of the programme in the private households, so it is just in the area of business, where open office that the big picture may: Finally, various facilities of public administration and schools to open office. 
Indeed, it does not even a training-offer a maximum assistance for small and medium-sized companies, and therefore even business prospects. 
open office from five main parts: writer, the word Texterstellungsprogram; Calc spreadsheet program, based on a squeeze of Excel; impress, to produce presentations with power point; Dbase, data banks to the familiar access; and finally draw a diagram module. 
The goal for 2008 is, 5 million downloads to achieve a goal that already reached 3 million and 600 thousand can be easily exceeded. 
Kohl also tested positive and the fourth doping case 
It opens up a new doping case Mi within the last Tour de France, it is the Austrian athletes Bernhard Kohl of Gerolsteiner teams, as Drittklassifizierter and winner of the shirts of the best Kletterers. 
The news, the newspaper L'Equipe published on its Web site. 
The 26-year-old Kohl of Gerolsteiner team is the fourth drivers, the positive for CERA, the third-generation EPO, tested. previously met this already with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher. 
The analysis from the blood samples Kohls is one of those who in the last few weeks of the laboratories on Anna and Chatenay-Malabry. 
The samples confirm the positive results of CERA, the Austrians will lose its third place and to be excluded from running for two years. 
The head of the French anti-doping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive EPO test, and Ben Oh right, according to the Associated Press, the Austrian authorities. 
The 26-year-old Austrian, behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the Americans Cadel Evans on the podium and claim also the Jersey of the best Kletterers. 
Immigration: The New York Times asks: is Italy racist? 
Italy, "the former land of immigrants was recently one of the best countries for immigrants', which only with reluctance. 
At the Belpaese a nation of racists? asked the New York Times in a long article, which is entirely devoted to the issue of racism in Italy and the case of the young, from Burkina Faso descended Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he had a packet of biscuits theft. 
The case shows what the Times called "paradox of the north": the northern regions are those "most integration and job opportunities, and yet" the highest level of anti-immigration 'sentiments and most of the Northern League, ". 
as confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times to other episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
and not only that. 
The new legislation proposed by the league against immigration and to speed up the deportation of illegal immigrants, as a sign of climate change in Italy. 
A movement, which the pope and the president: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the pope during a meeting at the Quirinal a cooperation between Church and State to combat racism." 
up to 900 students victims-euro per room high Mietspreise 
The market for housing students knows no crisis. 
According to the last survey, Sunia, tenants Union, an individual room students up to 900 Euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 cost in Rome. 
"This phenomenon has already adopted very serious trains. whole numbers of students as effectively lose their right to study, because their families are not in a position to support you in this level" - the leaders of the Sunia, Laura Mariani "in these cities, the huge demand from students to a distorting the market, which has also undermined the other inhabitants. 
also include most rental offers a series of offences: free contracts, lack of registration, without rent border, illegal under rent. 
Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures by a review of taxation lead to lower housing prices. 
on closer inspection the investigation turns out that in Milan, a sleeping place in quarter Brianza around 450 Euros is needed; a single room starts at 650 Euros (in the quarter gang Nere) and ends with 800 Euros in the quarter Lambiate Udine and Vittoria Fiera, or even 900 Euros in the quarter. 
A sleep an average room costs in Florence 350/400, a room 700. 
in Bologna, where the students are concentrated in the quarters at the university, 250/280 for a sleeping place of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room. 
In Rome, prices in the quarters uni around 600 Euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room. 
Only a little deeper, the rents in the quarters to other universities Rome: 550 Euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà. 
Only those who switches in outskirts can save money: 300 Euros for a sleep and 450 Euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas. 
in Naples, needed 300-450 euro for a sleeping place, for a room is the price between 400 and 600 in the most expensive neighbourhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei. 
in Bari a sleeping place 250-350 costs, a single room at least 350. 
In the smallest towns are lower prices, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy. 
in the cities, in which the phenomenon of the rental of non-European students often, such as Peru GIA, even further anomaly: a rent, the 25-30% on average, calls for foreign students. 
to see the old Cinema Paradiso the towns close their historic cinemas 
The historic cinema close because of the beneficiaries Multiplexkinos. 
"a city without cinemas is a blind as a face without eyes." 
This picture of the film director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect currently in the major urban centres of Italy, and in the provinces. 
The exclusion of cinema, the process began with the birth of big multi-room complex in the periphery, in the long term the death knell for a house cinema in the centre. A process, not just inevitable and irreversible, but also the outlines of a cultural crime. 
Most historical sites affected are full of memories, "it is like a friend to lose it has come a little streets full of emotion", the director of the film "nuovo conference Paradiso" of him 20 years ago an Oscar and the Grand Prix at Cannes. It is the story of a Vorstadtkinos and nostalgia, what it is, to live in a well-for lost world of cinema. 
The figures, which the particular, the main Industry Association, are clear: in the last five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas must; this bill paying the lion's share of the cinema in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 and 5 in Palermo in Turin. 
The areas most affected include the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by the Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41. 
This shows that the main culprits are the Multiplexkinos, because it is these three regions, in what was recorded the largest number of this modern cinema: with 195 in the last five years, the Lombardy lists, 81, both in Tuscany in the Emilia-Romagna. 
"The business has evolved in a way that is irrational," Paolo Protti, the president of the particular, "it is useful, that new structures, but on top of the preservation of already existing, for a house in the city are not all its good, instead of the old visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery. 
and there is still a lack of budget for the Fund Industry Association Äußer eight: the debt is around 10 million Euros recorded by the state. 
It is a shame the ethical-moral position that the government does not respect the existing laws. 
in the sector, would be between 16 and 18 million Euros in the year needed". 
interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, because of concerns about the old cinemas has decided by an agreement between the community and to protect the particular; it is the first such agreement in Italy, which aims to protect the traditional cinema and support, both in the historic centre, as well as in the periphery. 
Among expected measures are also tax before divisions for the cinema operators, and benefits for the public transport: it will be allowed to drive, the transport limited areas of the centre and also to lower parking fees Park. 
"It is a good initiative", Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also new design concepts. 
but we also need a better audio and video equipment, against the superpower of the Multiplexsäle can deliver, because it is the audience of today demanding. 
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important issue to me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, where my childhood and youth, was the tipping point, which led me to the "nuovo conference Paradiso ', even if I had played with the idea for 10 years. 
I live in Rome for 25 years and when I look at the Rialto or the Quirinale via Nazionale on, where I have seen so many different emotions, is about me to the side, not the dust covered posters to see. 
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro 
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared, the decisions of the community to adapt the interests of mafia group Piromalli .. 
The accusations of the prosecutor Kalabriens anti-Mafia authority against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosa Rio Schiavone community Gioia Tauro, this morning were arrested for involvement in business mafia, are very serious. 
in handcuffs was also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elder intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew, the lawyer, the same name as the boss of the clans, was convicted of involvement in criminal organisations of the mafia, then a compensation sum of 10 million euros. 
"Any kind of moral and legal standard violation," write the lawyers, "had the two local administrations decided, the lawyer Piromalli money to pay for advisory activities." 
"It was the mafia group has been made possible, so the judges-formal way to invade the town halls and public administration policy say." 
The president of the regional committee Kalabriens Agazio Loiero denied that it is "anything other than an exception in its region, on links between local authorities and the organised crime." "There are places where concentration of the mafia is greater than in other, in which virtually inevitable such links. 
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure from the 'Ndrangheta, heroes, a white guys. " 
The arrests follow those of this morning last July, which according to the police the clan Piromalli was beheaded. 
Since the end of the last April was the town of Gioia Tauro disbanded, but in 1991-and also because of alleged links between organised crime and the local administration-were the local politicians has been relieved of their local offices. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the UDC, after the runoff by May 2006 was elected the head of the centre-right coalition. 
He screams scandal as the police ordered the dissolution of the municipal council. 
He Belangte in the Vice-Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, he accused to have invented everything from political and strategic reasons. The judges but explain in connection with the arrest warrant this morning that the Piromalli clan had even dared to ask for a change of the A3 project. 
a bugging operation in connection with the investigations into the case Dal Torrione, has shown a willingness to accommodate the wishes of a businessman, the well-known a representative of the group for the Piromalli-which measures of public administration were identical to the interests of the clans.

If the energy from the waves, suddenly the great on 
It is a non-exhaustive money source, which cover about 70% of the surface of the planet and only now seem to understand the big energy companies in the world. This 
waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources to the now all, and seek to occupy, giants such as Chevron. 
The possibility of energy from the movements of the sea, is already in account for 70 years and studied; it is no coincidence that intensified these studies considerably since the first oil crisis. 
as the price of oil to 1980 crumbled Vergas we pushed the idea of marine energy, but now the environmental organisations and the increase in oil prices to new impetus in this sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated that 15% of the world's energy needs could be met by the energy produced by Ocean waves. 
This is double the energy produced by nuclear power stations. Now 
also the currents and tides. 
giants in the attack. 
The first company, is now on the marine energy, Enersis, a treaty in 2005 the construction of a power station in the north of Portugal has signed. 
When the news was published seemed to a revolutionary step. 
Two years later, there are now more and more firms from the traditional energy industry, on the marine energy. 
"Chevron examined these technologies" - as the spokesman of the American giants well-known company in the Wall Street Journal and Wägt the possibility to cooperate with us. " 
It is the creation of the American energy commission that is needed in order to launch a project off the coast of Alaska. 
This is a significant sign, particularly when you consider that it is in Alaska to oil promoted by the United States, and President Bush recently launched the plans for new drilling. 
In addition to Chevron, the firms verdant Power Inc. of New York and ocean power from New Jersey who invest in the new industry; details are not known, but observers talking about a rising interest. 
improvement technologies. 
Experts speak of a technology on departure, not least because the last doubts from the environmentalists are resolved. 
projects such as Portugal and Scotland of more small dimension and seem to cause no serious environmental problems. 
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, we need technologies with far greater impact on the environment. 
There are various possibilities: Ocean power, for example, is using a system of related Bojen. 
The burst of the waves, which Bojen and move down, within the swimmer on Kolben and Zylinder in hydraulic pressure converted. 
This drives a turbine, which in turn a generator. 
electricity will be sent on under water on the coast. 
Until now there are four planned plant of this type, which are still awaiting the government approval. Part of the energy generated could also serve on military installations. 
However, verdant power produced were already energy for a department store and a Parklatz through Unterseeischer turbines in the East River in New York. 
The water movements during the tidal drives the turbines, which by the central movement the generator. 
According to the verdant has been waiting a long queue of potential clients on the necessary authorisations to use this energy sources. 
Only the waves, then the tides. 
A special interest, according to the institute for electricity profit of research at the potential in the tide., 
Although it is a phenomenon of irregular, the tides but predicted better than wind currents, the Sun and the waves, and therefore a reliable source of electricity. 
The tidal energy is the federal states such as New York, Maine, Alaska and other coastal states led, already 7.5 million dollars to invest in 2008-planned for 2009 are already up to 35 million.
