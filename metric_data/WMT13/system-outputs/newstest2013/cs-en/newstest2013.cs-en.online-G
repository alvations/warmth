The strategy of the republican party against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders of the reasons its policy need to combat electoral fraud.
Brennanovo center, however, such a scam referred to as a myth with the fact that electoral fraud is in the US is less frequent than the number of persons who die after being struck by lightning.
Republican attorneys indeed, for the last ten years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US.
One thing is certain: the new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermine the american democratic system.
Unlike Canada have in the US, the responsibility for the organization of federal elections, the individual states.
And in this spirit, the majority of the us government from 2009 announces the new laws, which make it difficult for the process of the elections or of the registration of the electoral list.
This phenomenon recorded a boom after the elections in November 2010, during which attracted 675 new republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, it was only a year 2011 submitted to 180 proposals of the law limiting the right to vote in 41 states.
New election laws require voters to present photo id and proof of u.s. citizenship.
These laws also restrict the period for the elections in advance, zneplatňují the right to enroll in the list of voters on the election day and odnímají right to vote of citizens by entry in the criminal register.
Before the elections in 2006 did not require the electorate submission půkazu photo identification no american state.
The first state to which this requirement imposed were Indiana.
The constitutionality of the indianského of the law was confirmed in the year 2008, the US Supreme court.
The republican authorities spěchaly with the extension of this procedure as well as to other states.
For the last two years to support the proposals of such laws in 34 states, with the aim to force the voters to present identity cards with photos.
It should be noted that apart from Quebec american citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as health insurance card.
In fact, the half-11% of u.s. citizens, i.e. 21 million people in the age of allowing a vote of no identity card with a photo issued by the government authority of their state.
Further does not have such identity card of about five million new voters in 2012.
The acquisition of the desired identity card, in addition, is often more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affect mainly young people, minorities, and persons with low income.
25% of african-americans, 15% of those with income below 35 000 dollars; 18% of citizens aged 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years, therefore, does not have the required photo id.
And that's not all.
Students, who are as voters known for their conversion to the democratic candidates, not in several states authorized to use your photo id issued by your school.
On the other hand, the same states allow the members of the hunting or fishing clubs who elects rather the republican candidates, the cards issued by these clubs in the election of use.
In the year 2004 did not require any state at the elections and proof of citizenship.
First, such a requirement introduced Arizona.
From the year 2011 has adopted about twelve states ' laws, which establishes the obligation of the voters to prove that they are american citizens.
These measures clearly are directed to the limitation of the number of votes from the hispanic minority.
Should indeed be noted that two of the three Hispanics prefer the democratic party.
Republican legislativci in 2011 supported in eight states laws, which cancels the registration of voters on election day.
To limit the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to enroll.
These restrictions have its consequences.
For example, during the general election in 2004, helped campaign for the registration of voters to register, about 10 million inhabitants.
The measures taken after the year of 2009 but caused a decrease in the registration of new voters in 2010 to about 17% compared to the year 2006.
Republican lawmakers then in the other five states have adopted laws aimed at shortening the period for the elections in advance.
For example, during the general election in 2008, Florida african-americans accounted for 33% of the voters who have voted in advance, although african-american voters in this state was only 13%.
For Hispanics was the case as well.
Accounted for just 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in advance.
On the other side of the whites, who represented 76% of all voters, were only 46% of voters who have voted in advance.
Against the pass laws, which restrict the registration of voters, of course, very strongly opposed democratic lawmakers and their supporters.
Democratic governors have blocked his veto of the several draft laws.
In order to suspend the validity of the most controversial laws even hit the attorney general of the United states.
The damage they partly succeeded in limiting.
For example, laws requiring proof of identity with photo adopted only 16 of the 34 states.
The newly introduced rules, however, absolutely, undeniably difficult in 2012, the exercise of voting rights.
Democratic critics of the talks primarily about the bias of the approved laws and regarded them as an overt attempt to influence the results of the elections in the year 2012 in the key states.
The report Brennanova resort from the year 2011 shows that the states, where these laws approved, represent 171 of 270 votes of the electoral college of the necessary for the victory in the presidential elections.
It is too early to declare with certainty, that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain today: the new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermine the american democratic system.
The detection of prostate cancer: pass the examination or not?
The PSA Test was bringing sometimes erroneous results, which have been negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical zákrokům.
All this has increased the hesitancy of the men who have already been reluctant to examination at all to go.
Let investigate or not?
We have asked for the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the USA has shown the high degree of contamination between the tested groups, it is therefore difficult to interpret these results and bring valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time the european, noted the different mortality rates among patients who underwent examination, and those who did not go.
This study also demonstrated after 12letém distance, that those who on the examination do not go, they have about 30 to 40% higher risk of the occurrence of metastases.
I recommend, therefore, examination from the age of 50 or 40 years, if your direct relative had the cancer of the prostate.
More endangered group are also men of the afro-american origin.
The key is to take the right decision, once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such species, which are inert.
It is therefore necessary to properly explain to the patient the degree of hazard of his type of cancer, offer him a possible alternatives, neléčit necessarily prostate cancer, which does not in the long-term impact on the lives of, and focus in these cases, rather on the active surveillance of the disease.
Today, a number of men, in which the cancer was diagnosed, untreated, because their kind of cancer is aggressive and damaging to life.
We propose to them rather the implementation of active surveillance, and in the case of progression of the disease to be offered treatment.
More and more frequently and with greater precision, we are setting the criteria, which can help in deciding which kind of treat and which is not.
Yet, therefore I recommend to pass the examination.
The important thing is to pass the interview with the doctor and to determine whether it is appropriate to undergo examination or not.
In cooperation with the International urologic companies have developed Movember tool, which enables to evaluate for and against in the context of the examination of the DOG.

Prevention of diseases
Unfortunately there is no magic procedure for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the advances in research seems the best means for reducing the risk of diseases of the adoption of the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if all of healthy eating and sufficiently moved about, you could prevent up to 30% of cancer cases.
"If everyone quit smoking, this figure would be increased to at least 50%," underlines Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the canadian society for research on cancer.
By contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of the cancer causing inheritance.
Some percentage also remains completely unexplained.
For the canadian society for research on cancer remains a priority the fight against smoking, even though the number of smokers decreases.
Cigarettes worth 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
It is extremely harmful to human health.
"Today is in Quebec 1.5 million smokers," shaking his head spokesman Andre Beaulieu.
Encouraging indication: 10 years after the smoker to stop smoking decreases the risk of cancer deaths by half.
Weight
Tělnatost and obesity are according to the SCC another risk factor for the incidence of the disease.
Increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and the uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout the life protects against cancer of the colon," adds the report.
Nutrition
The mentioned organization is also recommended to limit the consumption of red meat.
At too high consumption can lead to increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is advisable to avoid and cold cuts, for which the same is true.
Preserving of meat smoking, drying or solením can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the cells of the organism and lead to the development of cancer," adds the report.
Vitamins
Recently, the scientists focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Research, however, have yet to produce a clear conclusions.
Studies on vitamin E are, according to the SCC contradictory.
Although according to one of them happens to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, other studies talk rather about its increase.
Or the effect of vitamin D for cancer is not clearly established.
Mr. Beaulieu also insists on how important it is to talk about their concerns and precedentech of the family with your doctor.
"To undergo tests does not mean that you have cancer."
The higgs boson explored
Notice of the likely the discovery of the Higgs boson triggered last summer legitimate stir.
There is an opinion, that this boson is involved in the mechanism, which is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And the last particle, the existence of which predicts the standard model - our best or the "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which, however, has not yet been empirically observed.
Between physics, however, so far there is not one hundred percent certainty, that the terms of the Higgs boson.
Doubts about the fact that we have available a completely new particle, which is very similar to this higgs boson, as is predicted by the standard model.
New data published this week during the great physical congress in Kyoto, rather confirmed, but there are no yet any data to enable us to have absolute certainty.
However, suppose that the terms of the Higgs boson, since the risks error appears as a small, and look at what's actually going on.
In this world is completely true unquestionable law, according to which the two things cannot exist in the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot bypass - and do not attempt to about it too hard, otherwise you harm.
Although it is particle physics a very strange world, it turns out that even in the case it applies a similar law: the Pauli exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "kvantovém state" - this "state" of the roughly speaking, creates some of their characteristics.
Further divided physicists particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find an orderly citizens or fermions, which obediently follow the Pauli principle.
And at the other end of the range bosony, very crooked anarchists, who do not appreciate at all nothing - certainly not of this principle, which means that they can feel free to be in the same place at the same time.
These bosony is further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way, absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the laboratories of the Berkeley: mesony, that here we leave unnoticed, and the "power of the particles", which spreads the great forces of nature and with whom is the Higgs boson probably in some way related.
Must say, however, that these bosony are not so exotic animals, how it would be possible to believe.
If this article read, it is because of boson with unusual banality: the photon, or "particle of light", which is "the bearer of the" electromagnetic forces.
When the particles with electric charge to accelerate or change its direction, "cancel out" by electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "intervention" will create an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing other than fotonem - and thus one of the bosons, "holders of power".
More stable field
Also is it with the Higgsovým bosonem, with the only difference that the "cancel out" is to be other fields, Higgsovo field, to this boson discovered.
This Higgsovo field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to his right, it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, similarly as with the frozen levels of the pond, already zčeří just a lot of large boulder.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part of the accelerator as a catalyst in the laboratory CERN - the large hadron collider is friendly ties is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! -in order to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field with us again suited to the clarification of the relation between the Higgsem and matter.
With the electromagnetic field do not respond-not all particles or all of the materials.
Some, for example, magnets, do so, but not others - a piece of paper, for example, will never be alone by yourself to stick to the fridge.
And the same is true, that with the Higgsovým field do not respond to all the particles: the ones that do, have a certain mass, while the other (such as a photon, let's look at it) don't have it.
And mrs Novakova is asking, what all of these researches are, what "will bring us"?
From the point of view of science it comes to the confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to undergo the examination of any inconsistency between the observations and predictions of SM.
Many physicists moreover, literally wants to be managed is found, because the slightest difference could open up the space of "new physics" and to close some of the gaps in the model.
It must be noted that the model still has huge flaws, it does not bring any explanation of gravity (whoa!) or dark matter, which account for about 80% of the space of matter (again!).
Equipment CERN, however, until now such contradictions have not appeared.
Response
The response of these research in the everyday life of mr and mrs Novákových can be predicted only a very difficult, a mistake, however, to believe that there will be no.
Lo: in the very beginning of 60th years not one of the pioneers of laser at Bell labs had no idea of the revolution, which their work will cause.
Expected scientific use, but nothing more.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where he was the laser in 1960 invented, and which has created the first permanent laser beam (previous rays were pulse) in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially considered to be such a "toy in the lab".
Just imagine...
And in addition, the application of the result and of all the instruments, which surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969, during their work on the optics.
This sensor, even when it Boyle initially at all so I didn't, and now serves as the "eye" of all the digital cameras in the world and earned him the Nobel prize for physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC we necessarily need to change the life, however, this means that one never really knows...
Palliative care - the Best way to leave from the life of... | Le Devoir"
Through its Commission for a dignified death is Quebec recently engaged in an awkward questions about end of life.
The debate should soon resume and at the same time is going to the draft law.
In this crucial area remains to be done, still a lot of work.
The magazine Le Devoir", tried to look at this issue in more detail.
Before less than a couple of weeks ago, lived mr. L. still alone in my apartment in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer that has been eating away at, gave him a two-year reprieve.
"Give me five years of life and it has been seven," said without emotion on his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it is still a shock, so you can't prepare," he adds.
The disease has done its work: the enormous weakness of him makes it impossible to remove itself to the toilet or just feed himself.
Given looks at the tasty-looking breakfast and agrees that he help you to eat.
It is courageous and even smiles, talks with the unknown, who is for him to stop, brings him his medications, offer a bath.
The courage of the ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to get rid of diarrhea, he humiliates me," says.
A few hours later found a team of doctors on his problem drug.
"Throughout the life of one learns that the guys in the urine standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in the device Victor-Gadbois.
To return to the stage the child is for some people an unacceptable humiliation.
"Depends on the ability of the person's"whether the return shall adopt, says the psychologist.
In the opinion of the number of persons involved in palliative care, the essential moments taking place in the very core of such a return.
Patients who are embarking into the home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois, suffer from all of the cancer.
Their forecast is for a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage of them the team of doctors and nurses who care for them, does not provide the so-called "therapeutic" care.
In the case of mrs A., 89 years old, is the worst fear to die "on the suffocation in full consciousness."
The disease to me but to allow to discover your children.
"I have good kids," he adds.
"In life already I have no desire to," he says, and then agrees to have breathing apparatus.
Yet looking forward to in the coming days on the last visit of the son of Italy.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in collaboration with a group of volunteers providing care for the body with the help of nutrition.
So, it looks like palliative care, which starts, if no longer possible to do anything else.
That death was more convenient.
In Québeku accounts for one bed palliative care at 11 700 inhabitants.
It is very little, if we realize that we all once we die.
Here life goes on in the best conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martelová, one of the doctors in the home.
Whether in terms of the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a man dies, can he provide, for example, a sip of brandy or pepsi, according to taste.
Diabetics you no longer need to watch your blood sugar.
And death is a part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening bear beer mr X., which later in the night he died.
Today in the morning dopije beer his son in honor of his father.
"Helping patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savardová, director of nursing services.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois the days go one after another, but like each other.
Next to the třiadevadesátiletého the man who delights in the last meeting with his family thoroughly vypodložený on the cushions, while he připíjejí in his honor, dies tragically šestatřicetiletý man surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children after having tried all the options to do in order to survive.
"It half a year there is always three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer to 45 years," she said with concern, dr. Christiane Martelová.
53% of the patients, who in the home Victor-Gadbois come, come here from their homes, 47% of the hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply does not have access to palliative care, i.e. to the care that is intended to alleviate the suffering, as soon as the sick reaches the final phase of their life, whether it is at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And a few organizations, such as the home of the Victor-Gadbois and the Company for the home palliative care Grand Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care given to cancer patients.
And it is this crucial unavailability of health care in Quebec leads to the fact that a number of doctors specialising in palliative care is concerned the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October is in circulation the manifest signed by the leaders in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which demonstrate its opposition to such an initiative.
According to dr. Christiane Martelové is not quebecký health system powerful enough to ensure the access of all persons to quality palliative care, than it will be possible to agree to carry out euthanasia.
As he says, has recently experienced a patient who has spent 14 days in the emergency room in a huge pain without anyone done the necessary steps to make her feel relieved.
Fears that the patients did not ask for the killing because of the fact that they do not get appropriate care.
And at the same time, a number of oncologists care for their patients, up to the last moment regardless of the unfavorable prognosis.
Hope for the survival of the Hélène Richardové were already quite minimal, when she left the intensive chemotherapy.
When I onkoložce told that I finish with the treatment, she answered, that regrets that stoping fight, he tells us.
And while she told me that it is the end!
There is omnipotent care
The doctor Martelová it is estimated that 90% of the patients who wish to die, thanks to his treating doctors at it, that their wishes please complete, when they team of palliative píče eased the pain.
But it is necessary to tell, that palliative care is most definitely not the all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereauové, director for palliative care in the Company for a home palliative care Grand Montreal, patients prevents the treatment of pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of his life, often doctors use of palliative sedation, the patient's government will put to sleep until the time of passing, whether it is required or whether he sedatives served permanently.
You cannot pretend that this part of the suffering we do not perceive.
The patient, which always with us the pain will still have more opportunities to access paliativním sedativům.
Sick, which is not given a sedative, they say always the same thing: "I Want to die".
But this need not always necessarily mean "I want you to tell me the reviews are written by euthanasia", it means, rather, "I want to get me rid of the pain".
The realization of this report allow the grant for journalists from the canadian Institute for health research.
Extensive real estate scandals in Quebec
Administration officials tract, entrepreneurs in the construction industry and public works, lobbyists, political parties and experts on the Italian mafia still tell what they know about the amazing "system", in which mixes construction, state officials, politicians, trade unionists and sight.
This "field" came quebec taxpayers is very costly, in particular, between the years 1990 and 2000.
"It is interesting, how the system crumbled from the time that we have taken serious measures," says ironically Jacques Duchesneau, quebecký member and former chief of police in Montreal.
Thanks to him, erupting in 2011 scandal on the basis of a diligent investigation focused on the embezzlement of funds in relation to contracts for the construction of roads in Quebec, which the then liberal quebecký prime minister Jean Charest has approved only after long delays.
"Duchesneauova the report" confirmed the direct connection between the industry, opaque financing of the parties and the corruption of state officials.
"Already from the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "save only the ministry of transport on the procurement of a billion dollars," when some people keep a tight rein on their instincts to get to them to share!
Charbonneauova the commission "has already led to the resignation of two of the mayor," he adds, with the hope that it will "rozkrýt the cunning of some of the people".
A permanent unit for the fight against corruption, established in the year 2011
A permanent unit for the fight against corruption based in 2011 is also involved in a fight with his army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
Still the police "Marteauovy entourage", who from the year 2009, to ensure that the montreal "cartel penězovodů" significantly eased inflating procurement...
In recent weeks have conducted a number of surveys and have accused of fraud and corruption a number of municipal representatives, such as, for example, Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of one municipality from the suburbs.
Next on the list is to be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his post of the mayor of the municipality of Laval, the third largest modern quebec city.
Is suspected of having repeatedly accepted bribes in exchange for a public contract.
Formal charges have already received also the transport engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, for example, Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation by, when the commission explained the mechanism of the "system" public procurement.
He devoted himself during these years, 3% of the value of the contracts, which in Montreal acquired, the mediator associated with the mafia, which then money transferring the side of the Union Montreal, at which stood the mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Zambito was after the year 2000 christmas on all sides, and devoted more than 88 000 canadian dollars (approximately 68 000 euro) provincial parties, in particular, however, the liberals, who were then in power.
He admitted also to the fact that organized the illegal gain finance for the former liberal vicepremiérku Nathalie Normandeauovou.
The contract with the penězovody, whose prices nadsazoval
In Montreal to work "system" corruption very well.
Gilles Surprenant, the former transport engineer, before the commission in great detail described: in ten years, received from construction companies gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, to the restaurants, the ice-hockey matches and spending money at a total of 736 000 dollars in exchange for contracts with penězovody, for which nadsazoval price.
Other officials from the transportation sphere admitted that they had to pay a bonus for it, that about 30% to 40% of the nadhodnocovali invoices through a false additional work.
Organizer starostovy parties Martin Dumont then accused Tremblaye from the fact that without the embarrassment of turning a blind eye to the parallel budget, which in its treasury leader of the dirty money.
On the basis of these revelations Tremblay at the beginning of November resigned, thus throw the Montreal and into large-scale crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first montrealskými members, who have released a warning signal.
As the mayor of the perimeter of the Rivière-des-Prairies to the east of the island, since the 2010 advocates against the sale of municipal land purchased for $ 5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promotérům right in the middle of the thriving trade with the real estate market.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
On investigation, which will be finally launched, says that "pulls the strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of the system promořeného ants to stop gangrénu and načapalo culprits".
The process is according to her, "a painful, but a positive".
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but it is necessary to set up in Montreal own investigative unit and ensure the supervision, to these dubious practices could not return back.
Like when they are cleaned.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says, that "public officials they stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but is concerned, in particular the role of the "deputies informed about this guile", if these čachrů nenamočili!
It is estimated that 70% of the financing of election campaigns in Québeku comes from dirty money, and ironically adds: "I have Heard that it is only a weak brew of fact."
Quebecká the government proposes to limit the gifts of the parties at $ 100, but it according to him, will solve the situation: "as long as is strictly limit of electoral expenses, dirty money out of politics will not go away."
It proposes a comprehensive inspection system of public procurement and financing of the parties: "Which already fall we can't; if we focus boldly on the essence of things, we can build again on a more solid foundation and with greater control and observance of the laws."
If this story besmirched the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommended to all those who deride him, to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!!!"
In this season you with PSG have deployed a completely new pace.
How can this development?
You can be explained by the fact that all of the individuals went into each other, or a totally new dimension to the PSG.
They came to us with the big players.
Every day next to them I am getting on.
The technical team to me too a lot of help.
Each day to me, these facts allow to increase the level of the game.
And during games, it is easier.
In football, everything goes very quickly.
Not wasting but the head.
Already from my beginnings in the preparer in the INF Clairefontaine until after the move to Saint-Etienne, I always pushed on the individual grades.
You use therefore, the competitive environment, which has Carlo Ancelotti...
Reinforcements this summer they used to play matches at a very high level.
They also know that every workout is essential.
And, it follows, that a player like me then more flavor to the game and wants to maximum performance.
And furthermore, I Carlo Ancelotti gives a lot of in connection with my status.
The hand has assistants, such as Claude Makelele, who used to play on the same post as I am.
And Ancelotti has the decisive word in the right moment?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all of the technicians.
Today has in the 1st league of the equal and are among the best european trainers.
It has a huge experience and with the top teams won a lot of titles.
He worked with great players.
According to me wins in Paris, the other titles.
In January I am with him he graduated from the soothing conversation.
I had a number of injuries.
The trust, which provides me with, is another reason for my performance.
As you look at the first part of the season, PSG?
In the 1st league of the us Lyon picked up a frontal position.
We remain but in tow.
One of our main goals is to champions League: very easy, we advanced to the round.
What is your club in this competition the goal?
We will try to go as far away as possible.
Now anything can happen.
But we certainly want to be for the european quality teams tough opponent.
We want first of all to win their qualifying group ahead of the Port, in order to be able to play in retaliation round at home.
Can PSG stand in the short term, a major european club?
The budget already on it...
To Paris has become a major european club, they need to win titles and enroll in history.
Today it is not yet the case.
The financial page of the PSG has the resources to make this intention did take place.
And it would be a big failure nezvítězit in the 1st league as in last year's season?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This really is a lot we want to win the league title.
In last year's season, we are still very lacking.
In may, we were disappointed because we had to win the game.
We had an excellent season.
We have collected 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points you have a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had a season even more amazing.
I think that this year it will lead.
Although the title and the big teams, such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think, is that we have weapons, we beat them.
Do you think that the media from the PSG expect too?
It is not unusual to expect from us a lot due to the fact that we have invested and what our players.
It absolutely accept it.
It is a fact that when at home defeat Troyes 4:0 and I still have yet to find something to us in the newspaper to read, so it's not exactly pleasant.
One wonders, what from you people yet they want more.
This is not, of course, winning 4:0 on every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!!!
We try to adjust your playing style.
To build a team you need the time.
In the champions League we have proved that we can play.
Have a look at Manchester City, which is already the second season qualified for the round, and in doing so too have invested large amounts of money!
Due to the invested amounts you would expect that you will be in front of the other 15 points ahead of the game!
By urážíte other clubs and the French league.
Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which is in last year's season too failed, with the new PSG have moved into the next phase.
This shows how the 1. liga amazing.
I hope that in may we will be able to smile and say that despite all of the difficulties we managed to win.
It seems as if the PSG in all relied on the performances of the Zlatana Ibrahimoviče.
It is good that says that there is a "dependency on Zlatanovi".
This means that Ibrahimovič is very powerful and it gives a lot of goals.
Because of this came here and proves that it is the star of the 1st league.

How have you experienced the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I very much wanted in this tournament play.
Unfortunately, due to an injury I couldn't play the way I imagined.
But I have experienced it and I walked out of it stronger.
Today I was doing well in the national team to play good matches.
And in this I was hoping since its onset in the national team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe to ourselves, to our demeanor exemplary.
As you look at the first of the month Didiera Deschampse in the forefront of the national team?

Is a draw (1:1) from the 16th of October in Spain solid starting the game?
This match us added confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Prior to this shock in Spain I have for your career such a match experienced.
Thanks Bitcoinu you can pay and sell without bank
All the negative aspects of the current financial transactions are based on the central banks, identified transactions, and the cost for processing among the beneficiaries.
As in the framework of these technologies, moreover, often the truth is here to feel the apparent political views: the belief that the existing financial system built on the bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, which the inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), it represents both a virtual money (transferable, however, dollars, euro...), so secure transfer protocol similar to Bittorrent, which allows the exchange of files between pairs of partners.
Thanks to the 15 000 computers participating in the network has already been registered about 200 000 transactions.
About a thousand of websites already accepting bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
Course bitcoinu first reached a high of $ 30 (23 euros) in June 2011, about five months later dropped to 2 dollars, today it is on the border of about ten dollars (an overview of the courses is listed on the page bitcoincharts.com).
In comparison with the world in exchange for real money or financial products it is nothing impressive.
And yet the European central bank (ECB) on this fact interested in its report on the virtual finances, which came out in October.
Bitcoin describes as "the most successful virtual money", "competing with the dollar and the euro" and "equivalent of the conventional money".
Bitcoin from other kinds of virtual money distinguished by the fact that it is as "credits" to be used for the procedure in a video game, which a person acquires the game, or that you can buy (and sometimes even back to replace).
Social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, but the central authority shall monitor and process individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoinu are all the nodes of the network to the depositary of the books of the current accounts, controllers, issuers of money, and the buyers and sellers.
How this network works?
Each transaction between two users is underway in fact between the two email addresses, using e-mail.
The user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information associated with this transaction is electronically signed by the encryption system with a double-key.
The network so it can verify the legitimacy of transactions.
Thanks to the contents of the file it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins existed in the public book of the current account, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key phase in the registration of this new transaction in this book.
Takes place with the help solve the mathematical task of the specified computers, whose principal investigator, a member of the temporary central banker, will have the right to pass this additional line.
This is the stage of cutting of the file; i.e., the transformation of a huge file on the shorter and unique digital fingerprint.
The computer "take over" this new transaction and add to it a number, then the whole "rozsekají".
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific imprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number to find the other nodes easy to check its correctness.
The transaction is then nezničitelně displays attached to a string, all other transactions; any adjustment to the change of the fingerprint.
If the user would like for the purpose of fraud to pay twice for the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network confirmed only one of the two transactions - the second will be abandoned, because each of them has a different fingerprint.
The computer, which will solve the challenge, wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, is this the reward of the regular two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited by the number of 21 million, however, you can share up to stomilióntinu, so that the margin for margin there is...
The difficulty of the task set, also increases with increasing levels of calculation.
The network has had its ups and downs.
The website, which for the Bitcoin provide services, have been attacked, and there has been stolen stored bitcoins.
"Used skulina not the protocol itself," he assures Pierre Noizat, who founded the Paymium, the company for the payment of real money, which uses a network of Bitcoin.
The ECB also checks the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Major players such as Wikipedia reject the gifts of this nature.
Others, such as the blogging platform WordPress, is to be adopted.
Adi Shamir, and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann institute in Israel recently analyzed the book of the current accounts and proved that nearly 80% of the bitcoins neobíhá.
In November launched the "huge discounts".
"Was replaced thirty thousand dollars," he rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul engaged in the transformation of bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of educational books relating to such money has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to the credit card (real money) or bezkontaktnímu the payment of a cell phone, but it uses the system Became for the verification of transactions, which are cheaper.
Nobel moreover, manages their identity and thus can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up for traders, where there is no need to install a new terminal or software.
Just tell the address, which can be a phone "ofotografovat and recognize", explains Pierre Noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users.
Occurs to the general movement to question the hierarchical systems and the transition to horizontálnějším systems.
"Before they Became the champions, even it it can take a while, but the year 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report moreover, it implies a rethinking of the various risks that are considered today to be increased, if this kind of money will be successful.
We left from Afghanistan.
And what's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and american troops should follow the end of the year 2014.
It is time that the afghan army has taken control of its territory, and that the Afghans chose their own future and did not wait for everything from us.
The greatest harm to the suffered people on the afghan countryside, which we are chastised and threatened, because we are considered to be terrorists.
And we also, for we have come to about 88 of the killed soldiers, and what all those injuries and mutilations.
Talibánci consist of foreign extremists, a former leaders, who had fled to Pakistan, but often it is venkovany, who reject the presence of foreign armies as in the soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, although joined them, jihadists, Pakistánci, the Arabs, the Uzbekové, Tajiks.
We are now experiencing tolerance and frequent assistance of local insurgents, but if western forces to withdraw their support of the falls.
The departure of French troops from the basics of Nijrab, which I watched from the peaks of the mountains posázených mandloněmi thanks to the French loans, took place in an orderly manner.
The convoy of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul, without infecting for air, accompanied by helicopters.
From the end of the year 2014 already in Kabul will not be talibánci so active.
From their inexorable process in the years 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was then empty and the country was in the blood, and fire, as a result of fighting between the various odbojovými groups.
Their taking control of the country was regarded as its kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghans paid a price for these occurred villagers, who completely dominated the organization of Al-Medieval'ida, their situation is, however, in our time has not improved.
The former mudžáhedíni, the afghan government and the current talibánci agree in an attempt to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main dignitaries from the war against the soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became wheeler-dealing, zmocňovali is state land, which they sell as a construction land to the refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and make use of the huge u.s. contracts to subcontractors.
Discredit; most of them, moreover, never in the fight was not.
According to what I heard in the campaigns, people yearn for the government, which will not form thieves.
Many of the young want to go as leaving those who were able to take advantage of the generosity of the american: capital flight is considerable.
Young already getting tired of the war and its associated ideology.
During the exile in Iran or Pakistan to come to know the modern world and its benefits is taken.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul lives in the present 5 million people, one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities there are state school for the full, he goes there boys and girls.
These young people will need to provide the work they are already do not want to return to the occurred earlier of the parties or to the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, like mobile phones; television and Turkish soap operas, which show the modern world, watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
The authorities will be, that will stand up to her forehead, considered to be legitimate?
The former commanders of the fight against the soviet army already renewing the provincial militia, which will be outside the control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of the local identity, should be to enjoy a certain degree of decentralization after the model of the western states, but the US it wanted to transform it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so there has been to the abolition of the post of prime minister, which has existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964.
President Karzai does not want to foreign control, in particular not on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
His country, however, is from the 50s and earlier years, significantly dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has failed to recover, no dam does not work, is not corrected no major irrigation system.
Everything is imported; nothing is non-existent, the only fruit and vegetables.
Preference is given to the private initiative.
In a country devastated by three decades of wars would be necessary government control infrastructure.
Roznesly rumors that Afghanistan has huge natural resources.
And it just has fueled a sense that the western states have been here just to have it seized.
Without energy to the processing of iron ore or copper on the spot and without means of transporting raw materials through the mountains, but no mining of minerals to be can not.
The chinese people has been almost abandoned mine of copper Mes Aynak and left the international archaeological teams (with the support of the World bank) the opportunity to explore a vast buddhist area, in order to preserve the role of the most important employers in the whole province.
One day you will also need to Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which it relies to a large part of the imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops was completed on November 20.
The new contract on cooperation implies the continuation of the common types of help: the girls ' and boys ' school for girls, the department of French at the universities, the French institute, the cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, the promotion of archaeological delegation.
From 2009 to work initiative "to win the hearts and soul" to the effect of a daunting task to align aid and military activities, in the framework of which then acted service "civil-military steps" of the ministry of defense (Cimic), which was cancelled in the year 2012, but has reached thanks to one of the very few French non-governmental organisation of a series of achievements in the field of common interest and steps for agricultural recovery in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, which involved a number of local workers, helped to dampen the insurgency: irrigation, water wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and expansion of the arable area.
What is the memory of consecutive leave after two billion euros of military expenditure?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improve local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often at an altitude of over 2 000 m.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for the small-scale agricultural assistance from the local community in the province of Kapisa.
To these farmers liberated from the rebellion led by foreign groups, they want according to their words to achieve a slight civil assistance in their favor, which would be properly controlled and touching them directly.
Difficult to work on the egyptian constitution
President Mohammad Morsi ventured into the next batch of poker.
While Egypt remains in its history, the most divided due to the promulgation of the constitution, which he temporarily grants unlimited powers, decided to play opted.
In the middle of the announced irrespective of the opinion of all the others, that the Constituent assembly on the morrow shall approve the final text.
Less than a week ago has awarded the head of state to this assembly the next two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years now uses Egypt provisional text, which was many times replenished, which weakens the constitutional stability in the country and leads to the legal arguments.
This new initiative will only further strengthen the division of the country.
From the point of view of the opposition of the president persists in his "autokratickém delirious", continue to "breach of its word" and "flies in the face of the law".
His supporters, however, assure, that it is a means to quickly take out the constitutional and political crisis and speed up the transitional process.
For two weeks there should be a referendum.
It is a very short time period, which will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intent of the text of the Egyptians to clarify the article after article.
For the president it is also a way to once again achieve the national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country rocked by protests.
As confirmed in an interview for the american weekly Time, Muhammad Morsi seems to be convinced, that the Egyptians will vote for.
Especially because this is a hastily organized the vote puts the people before the ultimatum: "Either approve my text, or can I leave the unlimited powers", which otherwise would have after the adoption of the new constitution to end.
And in this particular air yesterday 85 members of the constituent assembly with the large majority of islamists text approved.
Most of the liberals in the vote was missing.
In mid-November, not long before the promulgation of the constitution, bouchli the door with the fact that they do not have the opportunity to promote their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society, members of religious minorities, their step imitated.
In order to achieve a quorum, was yesterday morning hastily added 11 persons from among the alternates.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brotherhood.
No surprise, then, that the articles of the constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators on stopped over the fact that one of a handful of disputes that day revolved around... hours for prayer, when some members of the committee argued that the clock in the meeting room are not correctly adjusted.
The Text which is voted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
The object of general attention, article 2, remains ultimately the same with the version of the constitution of 1971 and provides that "the principles of sharia law are the main source of law".
Salafist party, to which the introduction of islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoping, that will replace the term "principles" of the term "rules", which would allow stricter application.
For islamists in turn, the fact that this article has not been corrected, represents a sign of their good will and respect for the other parts of the egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", they say, the liberals, who see it as just a rhetorical problem.
According to them, namely the islamization of the constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on article 220, which entrusts the university of al-Azhar advisory role, in particular for the questions of the control of the conformity of the laws with the law of the sharia.
According to the expert Egypt Sophie Pommierové it is upsetting, because "a person being able to express not chosen, and they have no democratic legitimacy.
You can in fact see the beginnings of a theocracy".
The concerns of liberals even more stirring up the fact that the next rector of the university should be less restrained than the one existing.
"For the time being displayed no specific religious consequence.
With this constitution remains Egypt general civil state.
Most of the lawyers, who in this text have worked, are not ulamové, but the university workers, many of them studied in the French schools," the meek concerns Alexis Blouet, which prepares the work of the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, agrees with the fact that "there may be contradictions concerning the interpretation of article 220, because in it the terms used to belong to religious terminology.
It is here, in particular, the reference to "fiqh" [islamic jurisprudence, note the red.].
And in the future may appear to the question of to what extent are the civilian judges competent, in order to be able to express themselves".
Yesterday approved the text is in addition to the religious sites highly criticized because of the extended powers, which is granted by the president of the republic.
The muslim brotherhood insists that occurred to their significant reduction compared to the former regime.
Another issue: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the members of the military will not be the verification of the defence budget to carry out the parliament, but the National defense council.
Further, then they will not be in the military courts prohibited the management of civilians, as requested by the association for the protection of human rights.
The association speaks in connection with the text, which is directed against the freedom of its doubts.
Criminal offence of blasphemy is maintained and how insulting it is to continue to disabled, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, in particular for printing.
No article does not deal the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayefová of the organization Human Rights Watch.
According to her, is the only positive point of the prohibition of torture referred to in article 36.
This word was not in the previous constitution mentioned.
While the egyptian president had last night off in a televised speech this afternoon are scheduled rallies.
The followers of the head of state will then be manifest on Saturday.

Tourists, on the word
If you're planning to come to Israel, you don't have to worry about my imperfect English: in this country speaks about 30% of the population is Russian.

"Great and mighty" it shall notify to Moscow: the expatriate can save you money on your language
While the members and human rights defenders are still debating about the law on the compulsory language tests, in the country have already discovered the fraudsters who are selling the "counterfeit" certificates
To Moscow, st. Petersburg and other Russian cities arrives every year 13 million foreign workers.
Most of them are the citizens of central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkménie.
Their only aim is to earn enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, came into force a law, according to which everyone will be working migrant obliged to pass examination of knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services sector, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
FMS however, the promises, that in time will be the appropriate tests compulsory for all visitors.
The test, however, will be composed not only of linguistic knowledge, but also of Russian history and of the foundations of the law.
Knowledge of the language will be also necessary to attest to the acquisition and extension of the work permit.
Exemption applies only to citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.
This law are not subject to nor for people who have successfully managed to achieve certifications and get academic diploma to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
The benefit, of the conviction and protection of the rights of
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of the pushkin's Institute of the Russian language, of the University of friendship between the peoples, of the Moscow state university, the State university in St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants may take exams in all the cities; it is already in Russia, opened more than 160 such centers.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing supported by members of the State duma and the FMS (Federal migration service).
But before the law came into force, they were able to defenders of human rights many times lay in the press question:and what it will in fact bring?
What changes the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors?
So first of all correspond to the representatives of the migration service - this will reduce the number of people who suffer as a result of "slave labor."
Many people today talk about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the chairman of the board of directors of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be started already before their departure.
Only a system of organized recruitment allow from 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for the emigrants without a profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language, - says with conviction Sebelev - is the future of migrants sentenced to conflicts with the rogue people who, under the pretext of assistance shall ensure the "voucher" to the terrible, tight hostels, in which he and dozens of other, like himself, to suffer for months without food and documents and to toil for a period of 12 to 14 hours a day.
From our migrant workers, we receive a lot of complaints.
"In their homeland they promise one thing, but after arrival is podvedou, seize them passports, paid the promised wages," confirms the Tajik head of the Main administration of labour migration MS Tolib Šaripov.
Do not flame!
The less that many of the citizens of the central asian republics, who intend to go for work to Russia, recognize that not only do not know the language of the country to which they want to get, but do not have the experience even with the job.
Of course it is not their fault, but rather a misfortune:only a very few of the Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least adequate basic education.
After all, their families need something also to feed the children, not to mention the fact that you need is a decent dress, wear and equip the school.
As children mature into productive age, must at the first opportunity, go for work.
Without knowledge of the language it is hard to admit it.
"You feel the humiliation and méněcenní."
It is true that with regard to the law on language testing point human rights defenders on the one important thing.
Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have a legal status.
If you have not, so they won't even take exams, or do not get any other official work.
Meanwhile, he lives most of the migrant workers as well as the first in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Unauthorized access prohibited"
Many of the coming of the workers claim that to get the official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - the bureaucratic obstacles and all those linguistic difficulties.
Legalization in addition, the costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But the false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that we have basically a false documents, without registration, and there are cases of extortion.
"Require one hundred, two cigarettes, tea," - he has shared with journalists their experience citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
"Come on, don't be stingy to buy a painting"
In the first day of the validity of the law on language was found that fake tend to be not only the documents on the registration of migrants.
The staff of the FMS already confiscated several fake certificate of passing the language exam.
Counterfeit documents are printed on plain color printer.
Of course, the new owners have not received a free lunch: each of the migrants in the hope that you so as to facilitate the problem with passing the tests, paid for this document seven thousand rubles.
It is two and a half times higher amount than the passing of the official test: this will become migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the nearest future so is to secure a system against corruption, to the workers of the documents could not simply to buy, in that conform to government officials and human rights defenders.
Government authorities so far can the promise of the foreign workers, who didn't make it tests the first time, the time required to have completed a course in the basics of the Russian language.
Among the visitors, who do not know Russian, it is assumed work in areas that do not require the active negotiations with the people.
The MVD (Ministry of interior) does not take into circulation of illegal arms market
The proportion of criminal offences with the use of legally-held weapons is very low
MVD of Russia presented a proposal for a tightening of the law in relation to the owners of civil weapons.
It is the response of government authorities on the recent events: the impetus of the cases were shooting at weddings, which is done without victims, and the massacre prepared by the moscow lawyer Dimitrijem Vinogradovem, resulting in the deaths of seven people.
The police wants to prohibit the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and raise the age at which you can obtain a license to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea supports the head of the duma committee for security, and the fight against corruption Irina Jarovaja, which has promised, that the amendments to the law on weapons will be submitted to the State duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem of the way of "tightening the screws".
In the network appeared an open letter, which the authors - representatives of different social shooting organisations, are demanding the rejection of the "senseless tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with the registered weapons is the minimum, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist in an interview with the Russian editorial office of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the interior for the six months of the year 2012 committed 142 of the criminal offences from the use of firearms registered authorities of the ministry of the interior, while for the same period were committed total 1168 thousand crimes.
The authors of the open letter are convinced, the tightening of legislation in the field of civilian weapons they do not lead the offender, in order passed to the "black" market.
According to their words can currently find in Moscow any weapon at a low price.
At present the Ministry of the interior claims that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the races after officers
The "black" market of arms is supplied with several channels.
The main channels of five, says colonel retired Victor Baraněc, who worked for ten years at the workplaces of the ministry of education and the general staff.
A Screenshot of the pages that accept orders weapons
The first of them - "the army or the military way", this means a weapon, which was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons stolen and Russian officers and caucasians themselves," says Baraněc.
Another type of "illegal weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals for representatives of the security forces.
Baranec explains that includes the theft of the police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from the staff of the bodies active in criminal proceedings.
Illegal "mainly" enter into the sale of the military warehouses.
In many military warehouses often leads to outbursts.
"It is proven that some of the fires were based deliberately, so as to cover shortages," says a former soldier.
Your contribution bring according to the words of Barance and the arms manufacturers.
"Currently arise private businesses are closing firearms, which are not competitive on the international market, and discarded weapons, which they make available on the black market, including Moscow," says this expert.
Another source of "black" market smuggling.
A particularly large number of guns and machines comes from the poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their manufacture, sometimes here the weapons manufactured in the malovýrobě, and was created by the mafia, which organized their continued production," explains the former soldier.
Where is the gun?
The experts they did number, what is the approximate market share of different sources of supply of illegal weapons on the "black" market.
A report on this issue was in the year 2011 the Center of the analysis of the problems and the design of public administration.
Specialists examine the statements of the Ministry of the interior and the Russian bureau of statistics, kriminologickou literature and data of public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, say researchers, comes from the military and the executive bodies.
Half of all the weapons found itself on the black market "through the fault of the official agents, whose work is associated with weapons," it is said in the report.
According to the data, which have to be or not available, comes 17% of the weapons of the armed conflict, in 14% of cases occurred to the theft of weapons in their production, 5% is a "black archeology".
Salesman-consultant of one of the stores of weapons, who asked us to never mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations black "archeologists" a long time ago nobody not purchased - they are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, vendors go for the new consignment directly to the military warehouses.
Through the midshipman get people interested buying a unit, such as a pistol TT.
For him, the weapon of order and he will give it sells through the fence.
"Get it went into the city, and there it is sold for 900 euro per piece with two reservoirs," she said.
"The truth is, that the police is well in the picture, and therefore at any time they will start to burn plan in the detection rate of criminal offences, shall carry out a control purchase at retailers with illegal weapons," adds consultant.
"As in a luxurious shop"
The seller to the buyer of the most often mutually located through their acquaintances.
I attended the websites and blogs, until there is a guy who offered me the opportunity to go on a platform of the "Trial", where you will be a man who I would be led to the "corner", where together we will act.
The price mainly I learned up there
Military rapporteur Viktor Baraněc
I want to get a gun, I need an acquaintance who knows the way out, tells the salesman - consultant.- Such well-known I have, but fully him not to trust.
Vendors on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from mr. Ivan Ivanoviče, who asked me to convey that the daughter dropped out a tooth."
And now I get there through the man, whom I am sure.
He is also delivers only me, because he knows that I neudám.
Beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
A former soldier Viktor Baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-90s, when the processed paper for publication on this topic.
Schemes, according to his words did not change.
They gave him the album with photos, where it was "everything what you think".
"I felt like in a luxurious shop," he recalls of the soldier.
The buyer, according to the words of Baraněce, do not offer a pig in a poke - everything you can try.
I, a potential client, simply nekupuji - here we go with the seller to the forest and how can we build target.
"Give me a chance to shoot, and when přesvědčím that the weapon shoots well, we are beginning to act," describes the procedure of the expert.
The tray on the sofa
The search engine you on the internet will bring to the website of the group on the "Vkontaktu", where he offers to buy weapons "for different purposes".
Do not need any documents or personal meetings.
"You just have to have a set amount of money," they write in the advertising headline on the website of the "Buy a gun or machine".
On this website users leave its notice and ask questions.
And sales to minors?
"Of course, without a license," asks the user for the "Ivan" (the spelling is preserved).
"I buy TT.Moskva" - briefly formulated by the requirement of "Fedorenkov."
The federal security service recently threw her a tremendous network of the dummy websites and people who want to buy a military weapon, can shrabovat a shovel.
People flock as a hungry fish the bait, and then take the coal in Siberia.
A military correspondent and senior military priest Viktor Baraněc
I have heard of such schemes:web pages are usually registered beyond the scope of the Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer shall make the payment through atm.
"In response to him, the seller will send a photo and the description with the instructions of where the weapon is hidden," says the spokesman of the non-governmental organization "Law on weapon" Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baraněc confirms that after placing the order on the website you can stay without a weapon and find yourself behind bars.
The federal security service recently threw her a tremendous network of the dummy websites and people who want to buy a military weapon, can shrabovat a shovel.
"People flock as a hungry fish the bait, and then take the coal in Siberia," confirms.
Makarov for $ 100
When buying illegal firearms pay according to the estimates of experts, the amount usually from 100 to $ 900.
According to the words of Dmitri Kislova of the non-governmental organization "Law on weapon" you've taken the pistol Makarov for $ 100 - $ 300.
You have to wait a month up to one and a half months.
The weapon expeduje from the warehouses to the long-term storage through the warehouses to the middle of the article.
According to the official statistical office declined in comparison with the period January - October 2011 the number of such crimes in Russia a total of about 7%, and accounted for 22.9 thousands of cases, and the number of solved cases of theft or extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the US we have workers fastfoodů and supermarkets
Work at checkout the establishments of the "McDonald's" passes up to a quarter of all american teenagers
In the last few days in America picked up a wave of protests against low wages in the hypermarkets of the company, Walmart, and in the restaurants of the popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave transforms into a wave of the ninth, or whether it is destined soon to be lost.
This whole share to support the trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to the increase in the small salaries they receive the rank and file workers in Walmart and in the systems of fast foodí it is the goal of the organizers of the protests to achieve them in the creation of their trade unions.
At present, this economic sector is virtually unaffected by the odborářským movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week after thanksgiving, in the so-called "black Friday"when America struck orgy cheap sales, gripped the millions of inhabitants and in some cases has been accompanied by even rvačkami.
In this day some of the workers, the company Walmart, in which around the world working to 2.2 million people have left their workplace and to demonstrate together with the trade unions and left-wing activists multinational companies, retail chains, whose goods is addressed to the people of the lower and middle classes.
Walmart sells throughout the world everything from diapers through hunting rifles and automotive batteries until after the vacuum cleaner, eggs, and milk.
Products in its stores are in average by 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the employees with low wages in the stores Walmart purchases only for himself in the work.
The availability and range of goods made of chain, Walmart, one of the largest companies in America.
According to the words of the critics can Walmart afford to sell the goods as cheaply partly because only a few are paying their employees.
They also complain about the poor working conditions, such as lack of automatic trucks or hand-held scanners.
Protesters of the "black Friday" demanded increase of salaries and complained that the cost of the health insurance provided by the company rose sharply from 30 up to 100 dollars a month.
A typical worker Walmart gets a 9.5 dollars per hour, it does not correspond to the height of expenditure, say the staff.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart will increase an average salary to $ 12 per hour, it will be the company to become 3.2 billion dollars a year.
It is on average by 1.1% more than the company spent on salaries now.
If the company Walmart moves to increase wages fully on the shoulders of the consumers, will each visit to the shop in which the state only about 46 cents more.
For the year as customers will spend approximately 12,39 dollars more than today.
Advocates of the company Walmart point out that the protest is held in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage.
"Black Friday" in the stores of the company lasted from 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during this time the company Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
Overall, its treasury carried out in the "black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
A representative of the company Dan Fogelman said in an interview for the left-leaning web site Huffington Post, that jobs have left a total of "fewer than five" of the staff of Walmart, and that the protest was all the trimmings "other media sensation", which organized by the trade unions.
"Unfilled checkout!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their aim not to department stores Walmart (those in that pokrokovém the city are not too fond of, and therefore there is almost not), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurant.
McDonald says that sells billions portion, and then you or not paid sick leave and not pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the city council in New York
Currently, the minimum wage for the work in accordance with the federal laws and with the regulations of the state of New York of 7.25 per hour.
Fastfoodové restaurant this wage gradually increase, but only slightly, and on average they receive their rank-and-file workers in New York 8,90 dollars per hour.
In this expensive city no one has a lower wage.
Do not understand well enough, as you can in New York exist for that kind of money.
Employment in "McDonald's" passes almost a quarter of the american teenager, who work behind the counter after school on a part-time job and live with their parents.
Only a few people in regards it as its main source of livelihood or planning to stay there for a long time.
Currently constantly meet in an interview with the staff of the "McDonald's", who complain that they must live off of the money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, at the forum the Wall Street Journal hanging comment, which the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you do not know, how are you going to feed.
The participants of the protests, which began at 6:30 in the morning on Thursday at the "Mcdonald's" on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashier and the chefs at the enterprises of fast food began to receive at least $ 15 per hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
Also demanded that in the sphere of fast food were based trade unions.
U.s. laws prohibit the administration prevent the establishment of trade union organizations, and to punish the activist of the trade union movement victimisation and dismissal.
From the other side of them, the administration rarely makes life easier.
To introduce in the enterprises of fast food trade unions is, however, complex and objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is an unusually high turnover of staff.
The opposition of the
On this day were held noisy protests in a number of other types of cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
The culmination of the event was at noon assembly on the "Mcdonald's" near Times Square, where there were few local democratic politicians, in particular, the member of the municipal council Jumaane Williams, who said:"McDonald's", says that sells billions portion, and then you or not paid sick leave and not pay you properly for your honest work!"
Protesters have seen the support also of other prominent new york democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must together to speak out in support of the workers fastfoodů to achieve a fair reward for their work and the economic prosperity it deserves every new yorker!"
As described by the newspaper the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the american sphere of fast food.
But it is attended by only a few hundred people, even though by far not all of them were employees of fast food, which in New York employ tens of thousands of people.
Whether this event will become the spark that will ignite the flame of a mass movement, is still unclear.
"So far, are doing brain deceive the average"
Among the fans of modern technologies of virtual reality is a popular topic of augmented reality; the last time it means to perceive the world, in particular through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference showcased Google working model of this news, and in November, it was reported, that the application for the patent filed also Microsoft.
From the interview with the head of the group of interactive 3D technology in Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Šaramem Izadim shows that for the scientists of this company are the glasses already a thing of the past.
Lures is the prospect of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, the creation of virtual public spaces.
- Tell us please generally, the deals with your research group?
- We are dealing with the interactions of humans with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity has stuck in the stage of work with the pixels on the flat screen, at most, sometimes touching the screen with your finger.
We want to go looking for 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the console Xbox and sensor Kinect - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without sensors Kinect, because for all is a very interesting opportunity management using gestures.
- What is ahead of us in the future?
- Despite the fact that the system Kinect transferred interaction on a physical level, very many interactions still ongoing on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has been improved (the system receives the greater the amount of data), but the output stream so far, not particularly.
We try to change it, we are working on a truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies including projektivních.
Need to throw the computer world in our physical world, to make it more realistic.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the users, but also the space around it.
Then we will be able to add into the real world of virtual objects in a much more suitable form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid helmets of a virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
It is the popular thing, but not be remeasured?
- Certainly, it cannot be considered a panacea - the question arises as to privacy, because it is not always we want to inform others in our neighborhood about their actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with the computer are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for control devices in public places, we had a project in which we think about gestures, but not on the rozmáchlých, only on such skoupých, short.
Gestures are doing nesnímala camera of the device, but the bracelet, which would monitor the movements of the bones and muscles.
So far it is great, but in theory it can shrink to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, that the future has a mixed type of control, for example, a gesture + voice.
- And how?
- To me, for example, you ask me you put this can of soda?
You will say it, and at the same time show.
- I usually just simply speaking.
- Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to force the user to adapt to what at any given moment can or cannot machine?
- It is not at all necessary, but it is of mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that are able to more accurately identify the reaction of the man.
This can be, for example, laser sensor, which provide a relatively good depth resolution, it is very important.
- If you have to talk about their work with sensors Xbox Kinect, what are your requirements to the modern cameras?
There is now sufficient resolution, depth or something else?
- In essence, the current generation - that is, from what we can be reflected in our work on the three-dimensional pattern recognition.
Of course that would be a good idea to acquire 8 megapixels speed of 1000 f/s.
But not just for the megapixels, but as the matrix and depth.
While looking at the thing they are all the current technology for the lack of us - it přidělává the work of the designers of the algorithms.
So we have to have in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also Z.
So very important is also the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic and present the data flows of 30 frames per second, frankly, are too little, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond did touch the sensor with adjustable delay the processing of 1 up to 100 ms, with the current, mass produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much it affects the interaction of man with the machine.
For me it would work was very helpful equivalent of such a device, only I do not need so much to touch, but I need some frames per second.
- Increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- In the system Kinect are now used three of the "camera", one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second - the receiver of reflected signal.
And for the third camera - this is actually the normal scanner visible bandwidth.
The latter shall not be applied to the determination of the depth of the object.
The greater the number of cameras could potentially solve the problem ...
Or worse, because it would increase the required volume of the carried out calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, tinker around with differentiates the location of the cameras and have a look, as it will help in determining the three-dimensional position.
- If I recall correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) not presenting publicly their glasses.
Don't you think that when it comes to the daily use of the technology of augmented reality using special glasses, it is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, go and constantly taking hold smatphone in the raised hands is not very convenient, but I think: the most powerful variant would be a "portable" the form of the expansion of the real estate, where it would be possible on the basis of platform clouds switch at any time from the glasses on the smartphone, the projection screen and a further round and round.
Glasses - it is a very personal device, this is their strength (private things you see only you), and at the same time also a weakness - augmented reality on the basis of the glasses will not allow you to work on a virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Starkovi in the "Iron Man", but also the normal smrtelníkovi.
There is one issue on which critics often point:there is no tactile feedback!
The hand does not feel anything!
What answers preparing your group to this challenge?
- In his lectures often say that augmented reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the mutual interaction between man and machine.
I think, that the addition of tactile sensations would easily could become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, using one of the interesting tricks - the use of second-hand as a certain type of substrate for imaging.
Excellent records of compression!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding hmatatelnosti these "lines in the air" - the example of the interference of several of the direction of ultrasonic beams in a defined point, where is located the finger, it raises the tactile feel, but still it is very light - as if you blew on the pads of the fingers.
There is also a bracelet on her wrist, which affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
To think, to feel what it seems, that should, at a given moment to feel something when they see?
- It is a good idea, we have unique venture to test not.
Here appears yet another challenge that will fight for a long time - how to make a man who is physically located in a very cramped space, to believe that walking down an open, practically infinite space, we are also working on the concept of cross-country skiing tracks (not at all such as in clubs), moving platforms and also huge spheres.
If the deception of the brain becomes the goal, so it is work for many years.
This is what makes the work in the virtual reality of the so attractive to researchers - many of the things is downright its early stages.
Vkusovština instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petrohradská avant-garde", devoted to the citizens, who are at the forefront, are the avant-garde of culture and art.
On the top of the list have already been an important figure in the art scene of st. Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often found recognition in Europe, without reached the all-Russian fame.
The new hero "Rosbaltu" is a stunning designer Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - bearded man, who is all dressed up in red, which meet here at the Russian museum, here in the Summer garden, here in the trendy pubs and vernisážích.
Images of saints Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed to, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical, the st petersburg storytellers, the makers of the new mythology.
Cyril Miller - it is conspicuous man of the st. petersburg avant-garde of the end of the ' 80s and early ' 90s.
In addition, there is the municipal man, his appearance on the streets raises a smile on the face of the citizens, which makes all the mood.
Recently picked up the flašinet and became the petersburg flašinetářem, because in this complicated the role of the ripe with all your cosmetic life, philosophy and image.
- Cyrile, so why do you go around the city the whole in the red and not in the yellow or, for example, in the tyrkysovém?
- I chose the color red as a designer engaged in appearance and image.
In this world represents the red color of the compromise between the artist, imagemakerem and the public.
Although the general rule is that everything is just a bit different from the grey, gives the aggression and waking up in the bad qualities.
But my provocations are focused on it, that was linked to a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative acts is above all an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you understand that you have to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the House of culture on Nevsky, where they were exposed to my work.
I understood what is the path.
If passed wave of the old liberal unofficial artists and the new, free, types of artists I failed to understand.
Friends I am with the artists of the new wave, post-gazoněvskými, who got us to the "Puškinské 10", and other waves were not.
Attracts me to the theatre, dress, music, all genres in addition to the words.
- And it all joined in your art-clinic ...- For me it was important to find themselves in the heart of the culture Petersburg, you should gather all the best forces of creativity.
In 1995, I occupied the place of the Puškinské 10, and there still existed prior to the reconstruction musical-artistic club, the bohemian club, the home of the petěrburkské of bohemia.
There is spurring many:NOM, Tequila Jazz, do not forget how to Šnura brought with the project "the Ear of Van Gogh".
Lines and his friends sang under the plywood light songs, dressed to the chest wearing a capital trikotů, in the midst among them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in vogue.
When the band started to play live, to become the "Leningradem".
Trachtenberg led many programs hali-galivských times.
We gave them the Trachtěnberga, thus began his united career, basic education and training received from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - it is a reverberation of the Art Clinic.
This way they left our workers and regular guests.
I'm the hero of the last century, when the culture still meant something.
In the year 2000 was arranged survey was in the press, the special price was "People in our town".
In the nomination "Artist of the year" I was appointed I, thus ended my top.
In the new times, according to the ancient rules of the work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In current years, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity of today are different things, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your works are characterized by a recognisable manner.
- Many of my paintings are hits, which is vividly captured the timeliness and acumen.
I have the program, the exhibition "the Russian museum in klaunech".
Clowns are timeless categories.
Previously, I used to be a sociable, today is such a painful and terrible.
But in klaunech everything blurred, the picks are tragika.
I love grotesku, I have a grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world the way of the totalitarian disguise in nařizovacím procedure.
Today people come together under the clothes, focusing on the external drive, not on the internal man.
Or maybe he is not shake his hand and be spit in the face.
And the fallacy will be removed převlékáním.
- Recently we have seen thee in the role of the municipal organ grinder.- The cultural city should have such a hero.
And who would it be, if not I?
- And can be of commercial art of the beautiful?
- At the moment should be commercial, utility art thorough, tactful, sweet.
Leads to the disintegration of the cultures.
Previously, people would gather in the hloučcích, bohéma loved one, free from other people.
Today everything had broken down on the mikrospolečnosti, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not stodolarová banknote, I appealed to all.
Today is the need to think, to whom zalíbíte.
Today, everyone has a cultural hero of its 100 fans.
- And on the Stasu Mikhailov comes a few thousand spectators!
- Him come groupies, there are becoming sexually social sphere.
And on the cultural soil comes 300 people and 10 thousand of them will not come, and the result is less management, money, everything wither.
I have fans, the main point is that there is no one neoklame and deviate from what is experienced.
When I was young, I have painted such pictures, which at one collector hung on the wall, together with the Falkem and Larionovem.
I started with the images, which people usually ends.
Today, people often confuse the concepts.
They say:the Culture of the spiritual culture of the consumer.
There is no culture of consumer, it is elsewhere.
I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up in the examples of the artists, who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money because of the drawing of images.
And I am for such a culture.
- Cyrile, what is in Petersburg lack?
- Good experts on the culture.
There is such a concept: činovník through culture.
Not every one of them but can deal with culture.
In the times of the regular tsars, it was not so in all, the czars maybe too did not understand the culture, but they understood that it is necessary to promote real experts.
In Moscow today are good consultants.
For us in st. Petersburg, we have people who might be experts, but they are inserting it somewhere in a corner, because they are the need of the great experts, who rightly appreciate these experts and bring them to the right path.
Today prospers vkusovština.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that honestly say that not all of the modern art we accept, there are artists, who would have had to look for other museums.
- What is according to you the Petersburg?
- Petersburg - it is not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is a culture much more, there is the right soil.
And on our total) is the art of doing miserably.
We need a cultural soil, but with us is today writers over readers, it is wrong.
In Europe there are very many people who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
For us, it is such a layer is just weak.
We need to make art become fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented by means of a grant St.Petěrburku
Fruiting in the universe
The country is in danger.
Global warming or by a collision with zabijáckým asteroid.
The caravans of the space korábů with the earthlings on board are embarking on the path, looking for a spare planet.
To save the mankind, this raises the main question: how to keep your family in the conditions of weightlessness, or on the spare planet?
I think that the choice is not great.
In fact, there are only two planets, which it is possible to acquire, even if only hypothetically.
"It is Venus and Mars," says a senior scientific worker of the State astronomical institute P. K. Šternberga (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
While they are but on Mars better conditions for life on the surface of Venus reach a temperature of 500 degrees Celsius.
To live there is possible only at high altitudes or in orbit around Venus... in the universe.
Address issues of reproduction in the universe began to scientists with flora.
Already half a century ago attempts were made on the plants.
Four generations of a pea grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
After it was done the handing down of the insects on the orbit - a very small fruit fly Drosophila.
In 1979 he was sent into space quail eggs, we have verified the development of the embryo in a state of weightlessness.
At the output we get absolutely normal bird.
But then begin to problems.
"The problem arises with the fact that this bird must find a foothold, it must stand on its own feet and start to move," says head of the laboratory of the Institute of biomedical problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev.
If they don't find a foothold, birds chaotically falling and they are doing somersaults.
After 10 hours there has been a freshly hatched birds to utter demise of the instincts.
The birds have not responded to light or sound.
And the trouble was that, in four days just died.
"Twice we left to hatch the birds, but then we refused, because it is simply impossible for there to work with them," commenting on the failure of the experiment with the chickens in the universe Vladimir Syčev.
The last of the "miniarcha" animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 will be experiments continue.
In biosatelitu "Bion" but they will only beings of one sex.
Conducted an experiment with rats, who were broadcast into space already pregnant.
Basically there not discovered anything supernatural.
"It was just on biosatelitech, but again - this is a unique experiment and such attempts is to be carried out," says Vladimir Syčev.
After landing on the ground with the cosmic rats born offspring.
Closer to the problem of the reproduction right in the universe is, however, so far failed.
It is a tough task.
Animals at the loss of habitual environment simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, unlike the animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens reigns abstract thinking and is able to create the appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons are similar to the experiments performed.
But the women they fly into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger threatened Tereshkova.
Precious thing humanity has is the woman's body.
Our Čajka flew down and no one on Earth could not say whether the last flight into space.
Whether it can do after such a flight was to give birth to a child.
"After all, this question still there was no answer," says a veteran of the rocket-space industry Vachtang Vačnadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, gave birth to the first woman-kosmonautka Valentina Tereshkova daughter.
The father of the child was also a cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolayev.
In 1988, a son was born second wife-kosmonautce Světlaně Savické, which visited the orbit twice, and that worked also in the open space.
The risk, however, remains.
We have just a few of the cosmonauts, which after long years of born and grow the health of the offspring.
"Moreover, it can be dangerous even at the orbital years," says cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet union and Hero of Russia Valery Poljakov.
Mankind still must inevitably look for new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrolaboratoř CPK is a compulsory stage of the preparation for the flight.
Here in the conditions of zero gravity, you cosmonauts get acquainted with the habits needed to work in the open space.
Water mimics the state of weightlessness.
Even for adults, water is even comfortable, but in its own way a strange environment for small children is a natural element.
Small ichtiandři seems to confirm that the life on the earth comes from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the child is in an average of 9 months in the mother's amniotic fluid and it is then easier for them to adjust you on the water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first swim, shall expire only 2 weeks.
"It is very little of it to the child something forgotten," says the instructor of swimming newborns Marina Aksenovová.
In short - if it is for a newborn baby weightlessness a more natural state, then for women is more natural inevitable gravitation, the attractive force.
In a state of weightlessness occurs very quickly to the deterioration of the abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pelvis, decreasing the body's ability to evict the fetus.
We can leave the party if it will work promoters of the activity of the muscles in childbirth.
After all, it is possible that the birth took place in a special chamber, in which the organism of the mother push out the fetus.
"And what's next?" puts Valery Poljakov complex issues.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it is not on the organism causing the earth's attraction, fails to properly form the skeleton or the system of muscles.
The newborn in orbit is not possible to dress like an adult to a special suit with the burden, which could train.
Just be deprived of what to its development unconditionally needs.
"If you go into the experiment, which owns the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring to the Country a disabled person, which would be absolutely nepřizpůsobená the village environment," predicts the head of the commission on bioethics IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.
So the birth of children in the universe today is just a theoretical question.
Once, however, the time will come when it becomes a reality and when earthlings issue in their korábech on a distant planet, which happens to be the home of their descendants born in the universe.
Head of the NKU: Check švarcsystému failed through the fault of the politicians
The Czech republic has in the context of public procurement good controllers and high quality legislation, but lags in its application.
In an interview for the Library it says vice president of the Supreme audit office of the United Kala.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the correct its application - this is what at us, in my view, the lack of", comments the current situation Kala.
Similar conclusions it also suggests joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of the incorrect practice lists the access of Peter the weather to the so-called "švarcsystému".
Recently, the prime minister said that the ODS will not be entrepreneurs bother its controls - is, therefore, prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be, after all, somehow set, and if something disables, so it nor the president of the government cannot prevent the activities of the office, which has a duty to walk monitor and enforce the obligations," notes Kala.
At the meeting of the audit committee in the chamber of deputies are you talking about a joint project between the Czech and German party, in the framework of which was matched legislation on public procurement in both countries.
On specifically what it was?
Regards parallel control, which we started about two years ago.
Basically the point is that the european legislation governs the way in which public procurement address, followed by the national legislativami and then also the very practice.
We have all of this put together, and even if the control is not yet finished, have shown us very interesting differences as a general rule, legislation is with us, maybe even "tougher and more perfect", however, the actual practice is in some parameters better in Germany.
It is, therefore, that it is not enough to create a still further and further more precise rules, but there is a need to devote itself to the application of the law.
What you actually, this project can help, what of him for you goes?
Just such joint control could contribute to stop efforts to the refinement of the laws, reduction and refinement of the limits, when it does not have such a positive impact.
Efficiency means getting the appropriate thing for a reasonable (but does not always mean the lowest) price, in order to exclude the enrichment and, where appropriate, criminal behaviour.
But the fact that we will reduce the limit of the contracts, that we may not necessarily achieve.
Perhaps, that is the system overwhelm such a quantity of "paper", that those who in the system they want to look for holes, so they will draw a lot easier than if the limit has remained higher.
Are you talking about domestic problems with the transfer of the legislation on public procurement into practice.
How does the system control in Germany?
There is the authority similar to our AUDIT, or it is set otherwise?
What are the authorities concerned, so as NKU there works Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized like us, also has a college, just to form a slightly different way, but in principle, both the authorities proceed by analogy.
Also powers are to some extent similar, but the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, so it has the following courts of auditors and on the level of the individual federal states - in to the system from our little different.
BRH can control only the federal money, with us, represented by the state resources.
Public means, which are managed by the county and the municipalities, there control from the level of the federal courts of auditors.
As the legislation is concerned, it is easier than ours?
In general, I would do it without the specific data I hate comparing, however, in some respects, is Germany called for a pattern, but can not definitely say that it is in all the better.
It should therefore be the fact that they have a better inspectors?
Certainly not, but I say again, I don't have such a comparison like.
But it is necessary to tell, that even the country, which we consider to be the pattern, are faced with a number of problems.
Otherwise they would not be any benefit to cooperate with our office, right?
As regards domestic legislation, as for your office marked the amendment of the act on public procurement, there are already somehow its effects?
Due to the fact that the period of validity of this amendment is rather short, so be with us yet still in control of the events is not exhibited.
Because we are doing the ex-post checks, it is necessary to count with a certain delay.
We see this not only in the process of preparation of the future checks - we've really hardly started our new tool "detection risk mismanagement", through which we prohnali almost 14 thousand public procurement, and we analyzed is - there are those changes course, will manifest, because they change the limits, the conditions of certain types of the tender shall be adjusted, and the like.
The approval of this law, therefore, consider yourself more of a contribution, or other load of the system of bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will confirm this.
A problem that can occur, that she rules "tighten" and will not be possible to comply with them.
Already for the functioning of the previous rules are controlled by individuals committed to the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council) to the fact that any non-compliance with the act on public procurement constitutes a violation of budgetary discipline.
It has, therefore the price of the law in this way to tighten?
I think not this way.
The system must exclude those who want to challenge and abuse, and not to punish those who commit a formal misconduct, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And how it is thus out?
Let us show you where the path does not lead.
Recently, the prime minister said that the ODS will not be entrepreneurs bother controls of the so-called "švarcsystému" - and what it means?
Švarcsystém is prohibited or allowed?
The law must be, after all, somehow set, and if something disables, so it nor the president of the government cannot prevent the activities of the office, which has a duty to walk monitor and enforce the obligations.
Can say: "we will Change the law and to grant it", but can not tell, that we do, nothing like that.
In the law on public procurement are quite strict rules as to what is to be formally done - which is right, to protect the public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic, when the candidate with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the correct its application - this is what at us, in my opinion, is missing.
Roads are the places it's, mostly, but passable
On several locations in the Czech republic are the road and it's also a snowy.
Mostly they are but the road passable, somewhere with caution.
The karlovy vary region
In the karlovy vary region were today in the morning the roads passable, places but it's and also snowy.
The temperature dropped by between five to ten degrees below zero during the day, but it has a slightly warming.
Snow in the region stopped, and in the lowlands is only a weak layer.
On the ridges of the Ore mountains, however, it is around 30 inches of snow.
Sometimes it was even lower visibility due to fog, it follows from the data of the control room of the regional silničářů.
Expressway R6 and communications of the first class are in the region now passable without restrictions.
Caution is, however, to place for example on some přemostěních, where the surface can be namrzlý and slick.
Passable are also all the paths of the second and of the third class, including the mountain roads.
On them but in some sections of the still lie the ruins of the frozen and places ujetého snow.
Especially in the higher elevations it is necessary to pay driving increased attention.
Pardubice and Královéhradecký county
On some roads in the eastern Czech republic threatens to frost, in the higher elevations and in the mountains can be on the roads travelled by the layer of snow, informs on its website of the Directorate of roads and highways.
Silničáři warn the driver before námrazou, may constitute, in particular, in the higher elevations of the Pardubice region.
Ice can be in the surroundings of the Lanškrouna, Usti nad Orlici, Shelves, Svitavy or the High Toll, especially on the roads of others, and the third classes.
Chemically treated the road I/43 and I/34 u Svitavy.
The snow is, in particular, on the roads in the Krkonose and Orlicke mountains.
The snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kneznou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia is today the most commonly clear to partly cloudy without precipitation.
Temperatures are usually between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, blows light wind.
Pilsen region
The roads in The region are today in the morning passable, places but with caution and the ride is a need to adapt to the weather.
This is after you blow cold, temperatures are between three to nine degrees below freezing point.
After the previous snow and the subsequent cooling of the so may be some communication it's.
Places must drivers to reckon with fog, visibility but will gradually improve.
It appears from the information the control room of the regional silničářů.
The D5 motorway is passable almost without limit, with caution, however, advise the administrators of communication between 80 to 131 mile.
Most of the roads of the first class has a surface is dry and vymrzlý.
On the southern Bohemia, and Beroun but may be it's sections.
Communication of the second and of the third class are humid and also in this case the notice on it's sections.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less busy roads in the area of the Bohemian forest.
Olomouc region
Snow mash on the road today must count drivers driving into the highest positions of the Olomouc region.
After chemical sanding remained at the saddleback of červenohorské sedlo the saddle and on the way in the direction of the Videlský cross.
Silničáře into the field chased away in the night of snow, on the Šumpersku according to the managers of the trips nasněžily about three centimeters.
In other parts of the region are the road mostly passable without restrictions.
"On the Šumpersku is situated in the highest positions of the remnants of snow.
Snow mash on the saddleback of červenohorské sedlo the saddle must drivers count on in the direction of the Jesenik," he said, today, MONDAY, the dispatcher šumperské road administration.
The terrain in the night posing danger and their colleagues at the Jesenicku, the path to ae highest position they are now, according to them, after chemical treatment bare and wet.
On the olomoucky region roads are passable without limitation, the Šternbersku, however, drivers had to be careful in the forest areas where road conditions remain moist.
At the county, the Liberec region
Several difficult to sjízdných jobs report today in the morning silničáři in north Bohemia.
In addition to several places with napadaným snow or with ledovkou is closed and the mountain roads of the Telnice on Knínice on its objective is to map, it is clear from the police database.
The temperature of the holding in the lower elevations below zero, so the ice and snow apparently on the roads vydrží.V the lowlands, in particular, to the southeast of the Czech central mountains, on the contrary, no problem, and the roads are generally dry.
Operational complications so far are not reported.
The incidence of ledovky reports silničáři, in particular, from the vicinity of the Steti.
According to the by meteorologists for her were in the night the ideal conditions - during the day, rain and melting snow, at night clear and frost.
Of the major routes are reported adverse conditions on the road I/13 on the border between the Recommendations and the Liberec region.
Uzavírku of Telnice on Knínice have made zohýbané the branches of the trees, which are under layers of snow ohnuly to the ground.
Simon Ornest: At the concerts we want to accumulate the positive energy of the
What do you think about it, that has in less than a month occur end of the world?
This is just one of the more alarmist, which we humans love which.
Together with the band and The Tap Tap that we do rather fun and we say that we are the only band in the world, which is able to collect enough positive energy to the end of the world oddálili or prevent him from.
In December, moreover, do you stage an absolutely unique project three concerts against the end of the world.
You can put it to the readers closer to imagine?
It goes about the nationwide fundraising action, that we are planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the mayan calendar announced on the 21st of December, at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before December 20 from 21 hours to take place in parallel 3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
Ending will be around the time when, on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the time zone of 12 hours in front of us, the end of the maya calendar.
Someone with this idea come from?
Originally it was about my idea, then we are all told, together with our artist Jan Wales.
In addition, that we want to collect enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want along with the public think about, what's the status once this the world we pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of items of shoes, t-shirts, bags or original germ against the end of the world which you buy on the www.e-tap.cz people can also support.
The group of The Tap Tap along with other performers also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called the "End of the world cancelled".
Already today it is very popular on YouTube, you will hear also on these benefit concerts?
Of course, in the very end, that is, if all of us can succeed and the end of the world does not occur...
Sing it all the artists on all three concerts in parallel.
Hymns are suddenly connect also in a unique live on Czech television.
The words to this song he wrote and the main role of Jesus in the clip plays Tomas Hanak, sings in it also Xindl X...
As you are with them were given to cooperation?
We cooperate also with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, due to the fact that we organize a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We are intensively involved in these projects involved.
It turned out that most of them working with us are interested in and enjoy.
On what will go proceeds from the concerts against the end of the world?
On the equipment, barrier-free educational center Studeo, which already for the sixth year we with the civic association Tap in Jedličkově of the institute.
For students of schools Jedličkova the institute regularly running out of lecturers and deal with them in activities that they enjoy and are interested in.
By the students do not have the means to make up for the lecturers have released yourself, we try to make them do it by enabling in this way.
In the context of the completion of the Jedličkova of the institute in the future will create a separate building that with this project we are going to pass.
On every concert will perform several music groups and performers.
What did you pick them?
We have tried to compile a program that will appeal to all ages, including children.
For example, in Prague will Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and George Dry.
All the details you will learn to www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning some similar "bombastické action" to continue into the future?
In may we will first speak at the Prague spring, so here you will get your interesting program with interesting guests.
In the next year we would also like played at the Czech national house in New York, and I personally, when we will already in the US, I would like it mixes well with the appearance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, yet have you acted, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, the group, which consists of the handicapped people.
As these routes manage the logistic and organisational?
It's not as scary as it seems at first sight.
We have five members on the electric wheelchair, its trucks have to travel in the baggage compartment, further, of course, vláčíme a large amount of cargo and crates with the tools...
However, so far it always manage without any problems, CSA and British Airways to the us were perfectly prepared, that I have many times until wondered.
Even in Moscow, from which we came back recently, it has been without problems.
Thanks výjezdům abroad you can compare how each of the different in bezbariérovosti, public access to handicapped persons, and the like.
With what you have not yet met?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places, where everything works better than us, we are just in Russia have seen that on the east, everything is still in the full beginnings.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barrier, there is still unusual to make a person on the electric wheelchair himself moved in the center of the city.
Not there even such a course, such as the need to wheelchair users you prefer in the elevator.
Fortunately, even there arise citizens ' association, which is trying to problems of people with disabilities to draw attention.
And what, on the contrary, we still need to catch up with the more advanced countries?
There are lots of things in which we are still behind the times...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and enhancement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London, and in Madrid is perfectly normal, that even people with severe challenges to independently move on to the public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
But it is not the power of the usual, that there is a large number of people with disabilities, actively participated in social life, in that we are on the contrary with The Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respect for the public or accessibility is one thing, but it was only at the moment of the us will be prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, so things start to change really.
So far these are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The band and The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let's return for a couple of years back what you find in 1998 prompted to base it?
I joined as a tutor to the Jedličkova institute, where I had around many young people, who were interested in something to attend to.
And since I am myself a musician, I play, inter alia, on the saxophone, so I, together with my colleague established a focal music ring.
Well, and over time we do it, as it says in our moderator Lada Angelovič, a little gotten out of hand (laughter).
The popularity but came up in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that helped us, when we started to interconnect with the well-known singers and also actively work to promote the band.
We realized that the work, which is not seen, in essence, as though it did not exist.
Thanks to the contributions from the European union in addition, we can afford a quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Was your goal to tighten it with The Tap Tap like this high?
From the beginning I felt the potential to do so, that they can do something differently.
Showbusiness is chock-full of things, where one imitates the other.
It's kind of a logical, everything new is taken carefully and it takes time.
The things that are rare, there is very little, but I dare say that the Tap Tap are one of them.
The first impression at the man, who see us for the first time, of course, is regret, it is natural...
But the regret is completely unnecessary, because the people with the challenges are no suffering all the abandoned beings, which we regret.
These are people who can live a full life and to develop, assuming, of course, that they have the necessary resources.
I say that when something right people with the challenges, so it does not shift only for them but for the whole society.
Help this success, that you have a strict boss, how many people identified?
When we want to do quality work, we need to be in many cases uncompromising and require a certain amount of discipline.
It is but I think absolutely normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic notion, and with my head in the clouds, and when it finds that must twice a week to go for the exam, be done on the preparation and spend a lot of time on the road, to the concerts, so there is enthusiasm quickly leave.
This is how it works but everywhere, in every group, which wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
Currently, the band has The Tap Tap twenty members.
How many of them was in its beginnings in the year 1998?
Only one Lada Angelovič.
We are an open group, people go and come, can't be prevented.
Who has the will and taste, has always door open
It will take place a day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 pm
Will take place in Prague Incheba arena, Brno Flédě and Ostrava in the Gas tank with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech republic
All three cities at the end of the evening connect telemostem in the joint singing the songs of the band and The Tap Tap "End of the world revoked"
The aim of the concert is to collect funds for equipment, multifunctional barrier-free educational center STUDEO in Jedličkově institute in Prague in the volume of 25 million Czk
Admission to the concert is 400 Czk, children under 12 years old have free entrance tickets in advance Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
In the past week the session of the ministers of the countries of the European space agency adopted by Poland in the twentieth member of the european space agency, as the second country from the countries of the former eastern block (after the Czech republic, which is a full member of ESA became the 12th of November, 2008).
Poland has launched the close collaboration with ESA in 1994, and in the course of the next years participated in many projects of the agency.
However, the path of Poland into the cosmos to have started much earlier.
Flights into space is devoted to Polish enthusiasts already before the second world war; but not always met with understanding.
Let me remind you, for example, a lecture A. Šternfelda in the Warsaw astronomical observatory, December 6, 1933 represented the ideas of its pioneering work Input to the astronautics.
Thoughts of a young engineer (nar. 1905) left to the listener cool, and after years of Šternfeld recalled that the only dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
Šternfeld in 1934, he received for the Entry into astronautics in France the price of Robert Esnault-Pelterieho and Andre Louis Hirscha.
Vzpomenutý doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and astronautics.
In Polish magazines published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski become a world-renowned promoter of astronautics and his contribution was appreciated even by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named by his name.
Already in 1925 was in Poland built a railway trolley, which should be equipped with a rocket motor.
Unfortunately, the author of the design is not known and not known, nor the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of trolleys or her down.
Information about the trolley are known only from the period of the press.
From the year 1933, the rocket projectiles began to deal with the Polish artillery.
Research provided Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia, in cooperation with prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved materials it is clear that the research reached the stage prakzických tests.
However, the arrival of the German troops of the research was interrupted.
In 1937, in the professional press discovered the proposal of the photoelectric interceptor missiles, designed by engineer Rohoziński and in the following year came out of the work Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza author Leliwy-Krzywoblockého.
Both projects were designed for military use of the rocket engines.
Just before the war all the projects of the military use of rocket techniques devoted to the Temporary scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which all of the work being coordinated.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activities of its activity ended the launch of the war.
Further work on the space after the war in the Polish press appear thanks to the work of the Polish astronautické society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time is the mention of the company in the November issue of the year 1954 the journal Fertility, in which there are four more comprehensive articles dedicated to the astronautics.
In one of them, from prof. M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to establish the company, which will deal with the kosmonautikou.
At that time already rozbíhaly projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that the space research is a promising field.
From the beginning of the year 1956, the Polish astronautická company (PTA) snažia for entry into the International astronautické federation (founded in 1951) and already in the autumn of the PTA has become a full member.
And in the following year, the first president of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became the vice-president of the International astronautické federation.
This function he held until his death in 1959.
From 1956 to the PTA contributed significantly to the development of a very successful meteorological rockets RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket, which carried out scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on the 10th of October 1958.
The rocket with the availability of 1800 metres was long about 80 cm, and her weight was less than 5 kg.
Later was built an improved version of RM-1A and in the summer of 1959 were launched in Bledovské desert flight tests of a two-stage rocket RM-2.
The rocket was a long 1,4 meters, and its weight was about 11,5 kg.
Further development of the type already should be able to actual scientific work - rocket RM-34 should have a service ceiling of up to 14,5 km and its task was to monitor the elevation of the wind.
However, in 1962, was another development has been suspended.
The successor of the first missile type RM has become a rocket Meteor-1 developed in the years 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-tier, its total length was 510 cm and a starting weight was 32,5 kg.
Were developed three types (identified by the Meteor-1A, -1B and-1C), which differed in the size of the area for scientific instruments.
In the rocket Meteor-1A was available space on the volume of 0,4 litre, Meteor-1B on the volume of 0,34 litre and Meteor-1C on the volume of 0,62 litre.
The maximum ceiling for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 took place in the Aviation institute of the development of the rocket Meteor-2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The rocket Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to give a useful load of 10 kg to a height of around 60 km.
Subsequently have been built version of the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
Still it is necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPARu (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
Poland is also in the framework of the programme Intercosmos engaged in the research of outer space on the soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 with a Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became Vladimir Remkovi the second interkosmonautem.
The abolition of the law on public works is not the solution.
In the past week set aside the constitutional court of the law on public works.
The resolution has given rise to the public a lively discussion.
Surely it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader point of view.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in the globalised world are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that the various economic departments, the national economic systems, is in permanent conflict among themselves.
The cause is the principle of free trade and free, unrestrained movement of private capital, coupled with unbridled financial speculation.
The influence of the significant differences of the price of work (wages) is the price of tension.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the state, when the manufacturer is trying to imports of cheap goods to compete in the competition by "podrazí" the price of a competitor to pull down on themselves a bigger share of the market and thereby increase their own profits.
On a massive scale, it means for the majority of entrepreneurs either to translate the production abroad, or there buy cheaply, or zaniknout.Výsledkem is the high unemployment in countries where the price of the work in comparison with other economies high.
Because private capital does not have any social responsibility and the responsibility for it produced unemployment, grow necessarily the social expenses of the state.
The whole situation is enhanced by the sheer unwillingness of the lords of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and to replace the economic and social societal damage in the pursuit of profit has done.
The situation is so widely known that it is not necessary to indicate a specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in individual economies the situation, when the national governments are being forced to enter into a mutual competition with the aim of artificially reduce the social level of its people in order to attract into the country of the foreign capital.
In other words, governments give to the private capital the mercy of their populations, regardless of the social decline.
This manifests itself mainly in the changes of applicable laws.
The aim is economically forcing the population accepted the price dictation of private capital, in particular in the field of wages.
This is done both by system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and, second, by restricting the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
The result is a growing poverty, together with the increase of the gap between poor and rich.
In GERMANY there are already a number of years the public treatment clinics food for the poor, who cannot own work to feed itself.
The number of these people are already into the millions.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy occurs quite commonly the case that a properly employed people receive such a wage that to them, the state must pay to the subsistence level.
Such a scandal was published even in the case of the auxiliary staff of the bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all of the southern states of the EU, without doubt, lead to the same state, when people are under pressure from the disastrous slump in the social level of forced either to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or vegetate for starvation wages on the edge of the company in the hope that in the country, perhaps one day come a private investment capital.
Here it should be but the real question but where it comes?
If it will be from other EU countries, then moves poverty from one country to another, or does not come at all, as a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or a Turk, Marokánec, or Egyptian, or African still work for a fraction of the european wages.
It covers the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and media ad nauseam claim that the state is not the capital to participate in their own economy, driven economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital stubbornly insists on the opinion that the state must control interventions to intervene in the economy.
You then need to ask whether private capital does not affect, now actually governed by policy and by the entire state in its own egoistickém sense.
Here is a clear answer that, yes.
The proof is the existence of virtually omnipotent and in all the states of the ubiquitous lobby.
The result is a desperate situation, manifested in the field of corruption, the provision of mutual benefits, the legislation, where practically all reprehensible, but nothing criminal.
In GERMANY the situation is that the state of the ministry for lack of funds awarded the drafting of the laws of the private law firms, which are often in conjunction with the industry.
These draft laws are then agreed upon in the Bundestag.
All power thus does not come from the people how to preach the constitution of the western type, but from the financially strong groups preferujících own interests.
It is obvious that the liberally oriented democracy is now quickly get to the situation, as it describes About in his work the Crisis of the roman republic in the times of Caesar and Pompey:" the State has already long been in full decomposition and the offices are occupied by the violence.
For bribes, illegal obtaining the grace of allah and for using stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption would flourish without any inhibitions and the people go to the polls with a pre-prodaným voice" ..."character of the people of the office at all neucházeli, so once was in the result of this breakdown of the state was eight months without the consuls".. .."Began indeed to talk about the fact that the only remedy in bad situation is samovláda and that it is necessary to choose a vigorous men.." About while the thought of Pompey, but he Caesar, which changed to take democracy to samovládu.
Conclusion Just as in the ancient world is the current company based on the reckless preference for your own benefit without regard to the societal interest.
Private capital is not inherently able to understand and apply the societal benefit.
The result is now, just as then, the unprecedented decadence elites without any efforts to reform goes deeper.
Kauzalitu the onset of the fascist and communist regimes, we must therefore look for in the indiscriminate liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th century.
In the current state can be the extinction of these systems in favor of democracy liberal type regarded as a break with the expectations of the next round.
A particularly disastrous is the fact that the current elite completely ignore in the future statisícové the loss of human lives, humanitarian and social disasters, which we have already witnessed along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The abolition of the law on public works is not a solution, at least not permanently.
Under the pressure of competition, both at international and home affairs of the european level will be the government of the Czech Republic was forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore the system.
The solution is targeted political - social reforms, which will strengthen the equity participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the citizens ' influence on the government and weaken the monopoly position of the private capital in the company in favor of the state.
Israel: the Laboratory of chaos.
"From violence, nothing is going to come and neither can never" Sting in the song Fragile whose main line in the chorus is "let us not forget, as we křehcí"
"If my sons did not want wars, there would have been no" dying Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschela Rothschild in 1849
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip, as always, vyrojilo a lot of reactions.
Some worth Israel, they argue its right of self-defence and the Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, the others promote the Palestinians, they argue racism of the state of israel, the genocide perpetrated against the palestinian Arabs and the state of Israel fit into the role of a terrorist state.
I don't want to think over who is in a periodically recurring waves of the killing of the culprit and who the victims, after all, today's residents of Israel, including the self-governing territory to be born into the current political situation and the onset of the violence experienced before.
My point is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, look at it, who mainly used already 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfourovy declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of the countries of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are supported by the available historical facts, some of them are derived on the basis of my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is in the first instance the history of the struggle for power.
In each epoch, we can trace some of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so evident is, if it were always these personality, which completely autonomously manage its actions and or whether their throne stood someone, who led their actions to advance the vytýčenému objectives.
We have to admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth zkoncentrováno in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and resulting power could not happen in the life of one generation.
Between these astronomically rich families stands out one, which could be considered as the head of the octopus (if it still is someone above them, I don't know, but I do not exclude it) - Rothschieldové.
To much about them does not write.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) bought already in the 90s of the 19th century, in order to stop the merger of its name with the high criminal acts, in which the background stood and which for them has always marked the consolidation of power, increased wealth, or both.
They have major stakes in almost all the central banks of the world and against the countries, where the shares in the central bank do not have to lead or are preparing war (prior to invading Afghanistan, it was 7 countries after invading Iraq, it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of the Gaddafi was left with only four, but in the meantime, Russia automatically make them subject to the central bank of the Russian government).
Anyone with this family tried to resist, he died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the central bank Rothschieldově Bank of America, began during the civil war issue its own (i.e. the government) money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK started to issue its own money and wanted to abolish the FED, was assassinated in 1963, a member of the Louis Mc Fadden in 1936 poisoned after what I wanted to sue the FED for the unleashing of the great depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in the years 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of the plan of the three world wars zednářem of the supreme, the 33rd degree of consecration Albert Peak.
The first war was tasked to remove a large monarchic state units in Europe, the second should remove the colonial manor in particular, the Great Britain and the third has lead to the reduction of the world's population somewhere on 0,5 - 1 billion people (such number of slaves for their comfort and luxury of the just, and do not consume much resources), the creation of one universal religion (ekumenismus is nothing more than a front for such a solution), and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families in the head with a Rothschieldy works is causing the crisis, and the subsequent offer a solution (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
These solutions are but a fake and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the founding of the FED, that there is no repeat of the crisis as the one you created in 1907).
So, after they managed to an assassination of the heir to the habsburg R-U throne, Ferdinand in Sarajevo to unleash the first world war, destroyed the tsarist Russia the launch of the bolshevik revolution.
The first world war came to a sudden, militarily as well as economically unfounded, the surrender of Germany (no longer needed to be war for the destruction of the tsarist Russia), and this subsequently led to a fragmentation of the central european powers, Austria, Hungary.
For easier unleashing of the second world war left the bankers policy to create in the conflict situation by the fact that Germany impose a huge war reparations, thereby created the premise of a radicalisation of the impoverished masses, and then they had only selling the Germans sufficiently strong, identifying the culprits and simple solutions offering the Leader and the further creation of a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should play too, and played, the function of the fifth column, in the ignite a war of fire.
At the end of the 19th century, to stimulate the Rothschieldové the founding of the Zionist movement, whose one branch of a push for the creation of a jewish state, preferenčně in the field of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The already mentioned Balfourova declaration has created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, it began to occur to the first conflicts with the local arab population.
The terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
Second world war broke out, if Hitler had snapped off the chain, which it initially the international bankers have held, or everything what was made in the plan it is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of european Jews in the koncentrácích created a prerequisite for the acceptance of the jewish state in the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and the like, as there was a war with an indemnity Germany off to a 2.světovou war, was the announcement of the state of Israel created the outbreak of the war of the third.
If it is the international bankers manage to unleash, will the jewish people, similarly as in the other, the victims in the first line of the fighting, now together with the arab or the general muslim population of the Middle east.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only within the country but also internationally (consider just how sharply divided the people of the supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the palestinian - israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in the endless chain of violence, when at the beginning of all stood greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish between the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because like us, podstrkují international bankers people a choice in the election solely their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of fašizujícího, to the international bankers loyal, policy, which is doing all it can to unleash a war with Iran, which would, due to the membership of Iran in the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatened to escalate into a global conflict and due to control Iran over Through the strait of hormuz, which travels 20% of all the world's oil (lock corridor is just 2 miles wide) and to the destruction of the world economy.
In the light of what now seems the words, which stated the David Rockefeller in 1994: "the Only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world order in their notion is the world masters and slaves.
The world, where the rest of the human population to serve the convenience of a handful of the financial aristocracy.
A world where everyone is a newly narozenému individuals implanted at birth chip, which it will make totally controlled entity.
"And forcing all small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to their right hand or on the forehead brand to not buy or sell, who is not marked with the name of the beast or the number of his name.
It is necessary to understand: who has the sense to let the sum digit of the beast.
This number identifies a person and it is the number šestset sixty-six."
The Film Argo: When is the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, occupied a crowd demonstrating islamist students of the american embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats hostage.
Laid off should be in exchange for the ousted shah Mohammad Rézu Páhlavího, which after the revolution, he fled to the USA, which have been a patron of his regime for several decades.
For the us administration, the situation did not offer a positive way out - to throw the shah of iran across the board could not afford to, because it would fundamentally threaten the confidence of the allies in other countries.
The release of the hostages but in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a teokratického mode, has been unable to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United states, which later was deepened by the failure of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
Detention of diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, then what of the negotiations brokered by the algerian government.
Their plight at home triggered a wave of solidarity and protiíránského sentiment.
The debacle in Iran greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan in the presidential election of 1980.
The Film režírujícího actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the history that America has brought a small victory.
Just before the occupation of the embassy of it have fled six employees.
After the complex misunderstanding ended up in the residence of the canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the canadian authorities managed to get is from Iran, helped in doing so extravagant a cover story - went to the canadian passports as members of the film crew, who in the country obhlížel the location for the filming of the sci-fi long film.
The combination of genres
The plan, which invented the expert on the "exfiltraci" Tony Mendez, require the cooperation of Hollywood.
To the legend was credible, talked about the film project in specialized journals, held the press conference, the fictitious production company would have had a real office.
Details of the operation have been a long time classified, the movie comes from the memories of Tony Mendeze.
Affleckův film is a special combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time, the so-called "caper movie", the story compelling base piece, podrazu - an example can be a series of Danny at the end of a partner.
In the film, so alternate mood swings - on the one hand, a documentary conceived sequence of Tehran (in the subtitle sequence are shown iconic contemporary photos of the events and the way in which were the same situation shown in the film - the large differences in how they are not).
On the other hand, lightweight passages from Hollywood, at the with irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then another scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions-the men in suits are discussed the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of the office, in the phone...
Ben Affleckovi is remarkable way managed to restart career.
From vysmívaného the actor became a respected director and his acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after dark krimi Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller Town (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Affleckův snapshot, which is not taking place in the režisérově the home of Boston.
A feel for the atmosphere of the place while he was among the characteristics that režisérovy older movies povyšovaly over the hollywood standard.
And Affleck him manifested in Epirus, where Tehran of "playing" Canada.
The best scenes in the movie are taking place in the streets, in the rekonstruování of real events - the introductory sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time conveys the emotion of confusion and nepřevídatelnosti, which arise when somewhere out of the blue moving in the history.
A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are making in scenes fake (fake staff at the tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places
The director had to deal with the fact that narrated the story does not actually much in the film the meaning of the exciting scenes.
Quite successfully with this almost works, sometimes you to the reality of something přimyslí - there're all so elegantly outputting (the scene in which the looming crisis at the tehran airport, turn the phone call in America and chase after the runway has a pretty far fetched).
A weakness, but it is restlessness arising from the need to show too many processes in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in rolls hollywood associates is a very šaramantní, their character would do but deserve more space and are not in the movie by far the single.
Affleckův the movie as a little bit of losing a dramatic move, it is a picture, which can be monitored with a slight interest, to appreciate the implementation of even the retro style, evoking the thrillers of the 70s.
Swept up but hard to find.
As a reminder of the one yet somehow, living history, proof of how exaggerated are ideas about the powerful and vševědoucích secret services, but suffice.
The rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
Server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually announces a poll about the most ridiculous bank fee, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most ridiculous regulation or ideas from the workshop of the EU".
"Led us to the last event, when the EU plans to take 40procentní quota for women in the management of major european companies," said the Right of the organizer of the survey Patrick Nacher.
Among the nominated absurditami already is, for example, the recent decision of the European court of unification of the insurance premium rates for men and women.
Yet while the women were in the prices of the life insurance beneficiary, because they are for the insurance company to objectively less risk.
"Another incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU people can nominate the end of this year.
The vote will then be run into the end of February 2013," informed Nacher.
Among the controversial regulation of the EU include the need to compulsory blending of biofuels in the fuel, which as a result of detrimental to nature, on the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury thermometers just because that contain a relatively small amount of dangerous substances, or the directive on the size of the slepičích cages, due to which substantially this year went up eggs.
Criticism of the previously faced also a de facto ban on the use of the expression for spreading butter or disposal of incandescent light bulbs from the sale.
Quality bananas have to have 14 inches
The union apparatus often decided under the pressure of one or another business or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels usually defend any state or group of states (as the Czech republic now even the threat of veto promotes the requirements of your bank).
The interests of the lobby there were also behind the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality and have had to in the Union attain a length of at least 14 cm and were not allowed to report the "anomalous curvature".
The european commission will not prevented by the fact that only harmonises existing inconsistencies in the national standards, which became more complicated trading.
Standards on fruit and vegetables have the EU despite resistance from some states softened with pointing out that the existing directives lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in the poll can be even last year's EU regulation, according to which must be sold inflatable balloons mandatory notice, that is, children under 8 years of age may not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU's appealed to the american research, according to which balloons are among the toys of leading cause of death for children to suffocation.
Similar restrictions now apply for children under 14 years of age when blowing up pouťových frkaček.
Quaint ideas are born at home
Quite absurd is then the rule concerning themselves european officials - everyone, who has in the EU, some of the official function, not with regard to the sensitivity of the topic for Greece to use the name Macedonia and a must place to talk to her about the FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Server Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire voted by the survey in addition to some of the above is claimed to be and eu regulation on the volume of food supplies to the territory of a member state.
The EU set a maximum volumes of food stocks, which could be located on the territory of the CZECH republic in the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech republic then crossed e.g. the specified volumes for canned mushrooms, for which he was threatened with a heavy fine.
The organizers of the survey intrigued by the idea of paying some of the countries that do not have the sea, and the idea for the granting of subsidies to the request for obtaining a grant.
These ideas, however, not in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We handicapováni by saying that we have the sea.
We ask the European union for a refund," said the autumn of 2004, the then agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
As the argument stated that the us yielded a lot of grain and in the result of the so-called intervention purchases should become a full warehouses, which had to be exported.
For it, that the Czech republic continue to ports, the us, the EU, according to the Palase to pay hundreds of millions of euros.
The european commission finally came out of the CZECH republic towards the fact that organized the tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
A subsidy for obtaining a grant offered by the municipalities, the ministry for local development driven by the minister Pavel German (US-DEU), specifically had to go to the drafting of requests for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: a Bizarre regulation are the exception
The regulation in the member states easily become the target of criticism, the efforts of the EU regulation and at the same time, more efficient operation and development of the whole Union, according to a number of experts deserve rather the recognition.
The more serious the problem is, according to experts, for example, the drawing of EU subsidies on projects, which do not have even a hint of something in common with the deepening of european integration, but that in the budget negotiations made by the member states.
Emotions between Czechs raises even do that, as well as other countries of the Union shall the CZECH republic in Brussels to fight for the right to a specific designation of their traditional products, whilst not always in this match succeeds.
The czechs, while following the six-year fight with the Germans and the Austrians protect the designation of the latter name, but the local rum, whose tradition with us back to the 19th century, had our manufacturers to rename the rum.
The naming of rum may bear only products of cane spirit, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products to the EU in a company of world-famous cheese feta and gorgonzola cheese, marzipan from the German flat-screen tvs or parma ham have found themselves, for example, karlovy vary crackers, pohořelický and třeboň carp and saaz hops.
The trade mark of the EU can also be proud of the pardubice gingerbread and hořické tube.
People want to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, claims Okamura
Mr senátore, as a man think that he wants to run for president?
I am not interested in it, be a senator or the president.
If it is in our country worked without any problems, so nowhere nekandiduji.
But I can't watch how the past twenty years, the country rozkrádá, how the thieves are running, the people of increasing taxes and the retirement age.
I did not have the ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, so I'm trying to come up with a solution, how to change it.
And since I already was forty and I am an independent nestraník, I have no other choice as to how things affect, than to stand as a candidate for senator or the president.
In the Senate, you've got, but soon you set off to the prague Castle.
Neotáčíte it back to the people who you have chosen?
The whole time I've said that in the battle for the Castle I will go according to the outcome of the congressional elections.
Later, I stated that, if elected a senator, I'm going to run for president.
My goal but is not a function, the function is a tool, how can I make my vision.
Therefore, I need the greatest possible impact and what the strongest mandate.
But the difficulty is not only this, that as a nation nadáváme in the pub at the television, but that pošlapeme anyone who wants to try to bring about change.
To add the media that the man dehonestují and that you confuse freedom of speech is the freedom to lie.
About me will be argued that the uplácím journalists or that I was an adviser Jiri Here.
Let's go to your visions.
In the battle for the Castle you set out with the propositions of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and back property returns over twenty million.
To do this, you need to change the law.
As president, but you do not have such a power, and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws.
How do you want to solve?
When I, as a citizen lobbied for it to guiding been vacant for a trade, managed to push this through.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or from the right, on purpose to reject the citizens lives.
As an independent nestraník I have a much greater potential to gain support from all the parliamentary parties.
My preference is that without the party classification and dogmas can I take something that is for our country to the best of each of the parties and apply it.
You are rather a man of right-wing or left-wing?
From the Czech point of view to me, it seems to me that people rank the more to the left.
For me is not important, if a little to the left, or a little to the right.
For me it is important to go forward.
I am not interested in whether someone belongs to the left or right, but I want to bring people together.
Always I will support any publicly good solution, although it will propose INCLUDES or ODS, and as well so I'll against a bad idea.
Čertíte, when someone tells you that you are populist.
But nedokazujete it by what you said?
When you create byznysplán in the company, so you also have some kind of ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get closer.
Someone that can be called populism, but all the suggestions that I'm talking about, already in the world of work, or about them talked of eminent experts.
But without the support of the parliament will remain just a password.
And with you in the politics of the long-term nevystačíte.
Or do you think that if you will for people to walk and talk with them, that you will be able to impose, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another option.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get on your side to make it through.
If I were elected president, it is not a problem to organize television, direct transmission, where I am going to ask the president of the parliamentary parties, to enacted material and criminal responsibility for policy-makers, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they would eventually had to tell, why they did not want it.
When will be a strong personality, which will be named abuses, can push on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was to the credit of the public pressure.
On the plane I say that I am an amateur, that I'm not a genius, or intellectual.
For their views and vision I try to search for allies.
In politics I have only just started and for your program, I will try to get the support of the majority.
Things I try to scroll itself, if it will not, for the six years I will finish, and return to the private sector.
A little bit of it sounds like it Didn should save the Czech republic.
No savior I'm not.
I know that in the one person I do nothing, therefore I went about a number of well-known people, whether they would also candidates to the Senate.
I went for Radim Jančurou, the one due to the amount of work declined.
So I at least support investigative journalist John Lorencovou, which rozkrývala fraud with light fuel oils.
I stood with the fact that people are really unhappy, but now I'm having second thoughts.
Sixty percent of the people not to vote, and those who went, mostly chose the representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are thus only two independent.
People navolili the Senate so that the changes will be difficult to enforce.
Yet I will fight for their vision, as for example for the direct election of mayors or governors.
You are thinking of establishing your own party?
I even considered, because I don't have the time to do it, to verify the net past each potential straníka, and either I don't have money.
I don't have money even for a presidential campaign, in my transparent account is only 20 thousand.
You don't have money?
You are talking about property confessions, what is it yours?
Private property estimate of about 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot of land of approximately 25 million, an apartment for ten million more flat for the eight-million collection of art works in about ten million, Aston Martin for the 3.5 million and the Damage Superb per million and then I have a couple of million on the account.
By the way Aston Martin I, therefore, that it was my klukovský dream - I always liked James Bond, which in the car he drove, he was gallant to the women and at the same time, he fought against the wickedness and nešvarům.
You Aston Martin, you have a property for 60 million and you don't have the money for the campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but of your own money into it too much giving you don't want to.
It is not too convincing.
I don't have 15 million to the campaign.
This I have put ourselves in debt?
In the campaign, I thrust already 2.5 million.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors, testifies to the fact that my program is probably not of much interest.
And I do not have the obligation of the campaign to pay on its own.
The cost of the campaign me, in principle, cover it, what will I receive senátorský salary.
But from him, I would nevyžil, for example, I couldn't pay the son of the English school, which is 30 thousand per month.
If I wanted to just make money, so nowhere nekandiduji.
So you will go on doing business, you could live?
Anybody tell you that these activities utlumíte?
But it is not related to the amount of the salary.
As I promised, my activities, I partially muted.
For example, the secretary of the match in the spring become my deputy.
People would like me was a samaritan, which will save the republic.
But I need also from something living.
How many of you as an entrepreneur was used to take a month?
Two hundred up to 400 thousand, which I take on.
And if I was president, I would for your business.
The full interview you can find in the Saturday edition of the Law.
Architects MVRDV are a proof that the real adventure is not only in the head - for example, Spijkenisse and recently built Mountain - books-2 frames
"The building of the strikes me as a cheerful, looks futuristic. Finally, it is again to see something interesting," says Lisette Verhaig that goes around after the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technician in the middle of a large enterprise, writes: "However, the house is nice."
I, however, I ask, what today we need a library.
All have internet, ipads and electronic books.
In any of these libraries in the old style already voluntarily no one goes, or yes?
Spijkenisse, the housing estate, in close proximity to Rotterdam without their own jobs that are not really worth the visit, hold a special record.
This village with 80 000 exhibits the lowest levels of education throughout the Netherlands.
To this stupid situation resolved fell several years ago the decision to contribute to the education of the general public and to construct seven nice pomalovaných reinforced concrete thumbnails fictitious bridges, which are depicted on the euro banknotes.
The success of the educational offensive but has not been any substantial.
And so the city councilor come to know that there is no longer the only option, how to become masters of the statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas from rotterdam's architectural studio of MVRDV, master insanely courageous bar charts and the contractor funny, often even cynical buildings, adopted the thing with the usual serenity and on the competitive negotiations in 2003, he appeared with the five books under his arm and a sneer on his face.
And while the commission still stunned looking around around and cringed backwaters, vršil free Maas their presents itself size and its aktivisticky substantiated the speech ended with the words "Dear urban village!"
This, then, is my proposal to the Mountain of books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later was a mountain for 30 million navršena.
It is part of the revitalizačního of the project, which also include underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjoining residential and townhouses with a total of 50 apartments.
In the beginning of November was a Mountain of books named the second place in "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Maloměstská grey, which has not yet been able to offer more than the post-modern pedestrian zone and the extremely ugly town hall, whose white facade you would rather expect the dairy, it is thanks to this, the richer a little bit of contemporary architecture.
Above all, it is but now Spijkenisse first public cultural construction in the history of its existence.
Long way to the book
First impression: the reading eldorado will under pressure cheeses.
Means of the massif mountain, there is a lift, but the actual spatial and reading of the passion, you will discover when walking the control of the topography.
From all sides of the glass-covered interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burnt kabřince and elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You can see the park benches, the dog and the boys and girls who play football.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally costs racks with books along the facade and in the middle there is a large dark area, which is mostly neútulný and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We are a classical spatial configuration of the built upside down and the space for the reader, we vysunuli from the inside out.
The interior Mountains of books is skillfully used: in the middle of the offices are situated, internet library, chess club, ecological centre and the central house of technology.
Special pure joy are black shelves for books, which are one-panelled walls, once the parapet, and sometimes railing of the stairs.
Look, the structure and the smell of acts cize.
Over the unknown construction material shake their heads even sworn architects and civil engineers.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, the head of the project at the urban village of Spijkenisse, on the question of the magazine Standard.
And so we are in one frisian farm one day come across a suitable waste product of agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands used as a basis under the roots mm fleece made from synthetic materials.
It is cheap and time efficient.
Thin textiles last one, two seasons and then it is ripe for the ejection of the bulky waste.
For the library was fleece - for the first time in such a quantity - then pressed on the boards of a thickness of four inches.
The action of the heat and pressure of the so-called Landbouwplastic (judas klp) turn in the dark, homogeneous and zatížitelný material, which smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 stairs to get to the top.
At the end of almost 500 meters long wandering you in the literary cafe rewarded with not only a fantastic view of the city, but also by the Dutch croquettes and fíkusy in pots.
You take care of the atmosphere, but mainly about the correct humidity of the air in the mountains of the literature.
Gifts for the new soul
"Probably you do not believe, but this house is in spite of the many glass tracts of prime project, with regard to ecology," says Trouborst.
Heats and cools the earth's heat.
Although the Mountain of books is beneath the glass hatch, the sun shines inside, only briefly, and even in the sunny days.
A wide glued wooden trusses, which is perpendicular to the glass facade, serves as shading and capture a large part of solar radiation.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
With the rest of you to advise you fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic of the IT industry, already the new library is visited.
I Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also a teacher of traditional chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, which Boekenberg even referred to as the "long-awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
The reason: every inhabitant of the city was several weeks ago, invited to the opening, devoted to one book of his personal fund.
Should be the first full optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped with a library, which currently comprises 70 000 pieces.
The concept has proven itself.
The shelves are completely filled.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation has now to a new house every inhabitant of a particular relationship.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for decoration.
By MVRDV been more successful in the royal discipline, which in the professional jargon says identity formation.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
However young and uneducated.
It is finally starting point for identity.
Szabo: "the Germans have to play a greater role"
Germany abstentions, when deciding on the admission of Palestine.
According to the expert on relations between the US and Europe Stephen Szaboa by Berlin teetering on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany at the beginning of the week the first signaled that it would vote against the draft on the observer status of the Palestinians in the Organization of the united nations.
But then the Berlin abstained from the vote.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, must be Germany because of his special relationship with Israel prudent.
But at the same time I think that will not support nor the american position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - without, however, it was too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in march 2011, Germany also abstentions, when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
Here eventually happen NATO.
It is difficult for Germany to take in major international issues is a clear position?
Yes, it is so.
The reason is that this is changing its foreign policy, from the direction of the policy, which was, so to speak, managed by the USA, the direction of German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult, that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The germans are, therefore, between the two queues.
It is expected from them that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think, in its role as the only installing themselves, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
In foreign policy, as in France or the Uk.
What specifically does "normal" foreign policy of the German point of view?
Shows the readiness to take in the case of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the attitudes of the USA or the european partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, therefore, the export and its relations with certain areas, need to Russia, China or the Middle east.
The economic interests of Germany are, to some extent, other than the economic interests of other great powers, and therefore Germany must have their own interests to protect.
Should the economic interests of the impact on the attitude of the middle east conflict and the vote in the UN?
Firstly, Germany has a large outlets in the Middle east, especially in the states around the Persian gulf.
Therefore, the need to be cautious, to neodstrašilo the public, but neither the elite in the arab countries.
This, in any case plays a role.
I would not want to do but did not attribute too much importance, it is not entirely one-sided relationship.
Plays it, however, in any case, an important role in the German considerations.
Harm the relations of Germany with the US, when Germany in the case of both of important decision-making abstentions, for example, during the vote on the Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the US, ruled by a great understanding for the German position.
So I do not think that it was so dramatic turning point as in the question of Libya.
Perhaps for that Germany even the winners certain respect.
It signals that must be considered to be an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different views on the palestinian initiative.
The US in contrast, clearly spoke in favour of the veto.
There are between the U.S. and many european nations differences of opinion?
These differences existed in the wake of america's internal policy.
I think that the Obama administration has about furtively a great deal of understanding for the european position.
But due to the political situation can this attitude, of course, play a publicly.
I think that the differences actually are not so great, as always seem to.
When you look at the relations between Obama and prime minister Netanyahu, so Obama is not so much excited by the Netanjahuovou policy.
It is not for Germany difficult to reconcile their close relations with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and with the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other hand?
I think that this is exactly as it Germans makes it difficult.
For the Germans would, of course, a little bit easier if there was a coherent and uniform european policy, which is currently not the case.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader line and must instead pushing things forward of their own position.
It did they do with the euro.
I believe, that Germany in the future takes a leading role and will push Europe to the european position.
For Germany, of course, is not easy, for the sake of the relationship with Israel.
It was always a sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
See Germany itself in the role of an important international player? He wants to ever take over the main role?
Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany still is not used, it is still annoying, and for this country is for obvious reasons still difficult to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the european crisis, as always, when Germany take a greater role, there will be anti-German sentiment.
It's the Germans neulehčuje.
This is actually an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable for all sorts of neighbors and opinions and it is not easy.
The influence of the US in european politics now constantly decreasing, the EU, however, this vacuum is currently not used. Who is otherwise left?
The germans simply will have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like it, they're annoying and makes it much neoblíbenějšími - c'est la vie!

"The protection of brands" in China: when are the Puma and Armani suddenly chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is the Armani Polo?
For this lies designation, which is in China quite officially registered, but with the original company has nothing to do.
Enjoy, however, the protection so long as it is nezažalují the real owners of the brand.
And even then it is not clear whether domohou rights.
"For a foreigner it is increasingly difficult to protect in China its brand," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the office of Taylor Wessing, which specializes in violations of the protection of the rights of the Far east.
Every week lands on my work table a new case.
Counterfeiters just have a few points in addition, to be able to log in to your brand.
Of the Gucci brand is so, for example, becomes Lu-Gucci and instead Prada well advised to register Prada-Kny.
In this way they are legally copied and German firms, the need to manufacturers of sports goods Puma.
Pattloch opens a binder with the records of the trademark office in Beijing.
14 September 2010, you left one chinese company to protect the trademark Zegna DF Puma. Artificial name, which citrons and at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are masters of the world in the copy, and violations of intellectual property rights.
In the big cities are několikapatrové business houses in which are almost exclusively sold fakes.
Pattlochovy cases are but different. On behalf of its clients proceed against the fact that the chinese companies have received from the trademark office totally officially the right to use the designation, which is already protected somewhere else.
The chinese call it the "Bang Mingpai", an affiliate of the brand.
This word is focusing on "Bang Dakuan".
This meant women who hunt the rich man.
The chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"To the detriment of trade, we need to combat it," calls on the Pattloch.
"The brand has to dilute, the exclusive position disappear, damage the image of is enormous."
Financial losses and legal costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially for precious sample of products.
According to the data of the company for market research at CLSA China with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, the third-largest market for luxury goods and the market, which is growing the fastest.
Deletion of the offending records in the register of brands can be achieved, however, through difficult and something's worth.
Management can stretch up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells about the cases, when the court dismissed the action, because vytýkaný name became after the long duration of the "market reality".
When has the complaining party out of luck, must plagiátorovi still have to pay, because of the damage to its brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Known cases of concern and graphic elements.
In 2009, lost Daimler legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, firm, which recently took over the German pump manufacturer in the concrete mixture Putzmeister.
The chinese why, to this day, may use the emblem, which resembles a star Mercedes.
The company Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used, blue-white logo, which was like a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
Manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with the forger of hong Kong and Singapore, who the famous crocodile turned in the opposite direction.
The chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Trade mark office CTMO, although he admits that there in the year 2010 there were shortcomings due to the too small number of staff and space.
But in the last year is allegedly "the course of the work process returned from an emergency situation to normal".
For example, the number of unprocessed management of objections fell by 22 percent.
Matched was 57 000 of these cases, about 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still waiting at the office of the still 81 500 complaints on the settlement.
Something against it to take it is expensive
As is the case in China often, they are impressing numbers.
In the last year was CTMO delivered to more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of the brand, which is almost one-third more than the year 2010.
This is a record, and it means, that China is the tenth time in succession leads the list of new applications around the world.
This also applies to the number of all existing protective brands - there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, the charges selected 1.8 billion yuan.
Simply put, this means that each login in diameter is 1280 yuan, or 160 eur.
Start against this dispute is a multiple of, as shown by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
This group has already more than seven years of fighting against the chinese plagiátorovi.
The germans have been canceled his illegal manufacture imitovaných of automotive parts.
However, the forger clinched china's rights to the mark Freudenberg continue.
Alone we have neglected, as in Germany cannot be the surname of protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of the company Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
Trade mark office CTMO then also the objection of the munich company dismissed.
In the other two instances while Freudenberg obtain rights, however the respondent in the dispute fights on this day.
It must be awful careful
Now it is a matter pending in the Supreme court.
Wentzler has the confidence, that the thing will lead to a good end, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But it also says: "the Management is extremely expensive and cost us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the archives of the firms are having to even see a hundred year old writings, to supply evidence.
Five years ago the company Freudenberg the ccp in vain to offer "high šestimístnou amount in euro" for the purpose of settlement of the dispute.
"From what you see, what it means for us", says Wentzler.
There is a risk that the danger from the Far east to hit Europe.
And in the case, when there imitators ensure unprotected brand.
One chinese manufacturer, for example, wanted in Germany log designation of the Freudenberg for footwear and leather.
This area of business the group gave up a long time ago, yet managed to stave off the registration.
"It must be awful careful," says Wentzler.
He and the attorney Pattloch advises the German enterprises, that when trading with China very careful.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law. Foreigners would rather have had "everything in any way worth protection, log in China", says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration.
Indeed: if the company Freudenberg in the last act of her drama with the brand succumb, then it probably will have to counterparty to pay licensing fees for own name, explains Wentzler.
Or will we in the contested segment pushed out of the market.
The world day of struggle against AIDS: the stomping, chanting, help
In Heidelberg tested choir Imbongi - and in Swaziland, it's a joy to orphans after the parents who have died of AIDS.
The story of the connection, which overcomes much more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all there is stomping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's boating and men's moccasins are looking for on the dance floor tact and quickly found it.
One-two-three-four.
Then slowly vzedmou the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - urging mámí and mutually prosecutes.
29letého conductor Fiete Hopfa it almost rises from its textile shoes, when it combines the voices of their vláčně wild gestures.
It's Monday evening. In the music room of the Institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg tested choir Imbongi a new song.
Came to fifty singers and singers between 23 and 69 years ago, from the researcher, human genetics after a concierge.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, every choir voice has a different text and, moreover, in a very foreign language - zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in parts of Swaziland.
Help to self-help
Unaids, the programme of the united nations for the fight against AIDS, it is estimated that around the world there are approximately 34 million people who are infected with the HIV virus.
Of 23.5 million lives in the south of Africa.
In Swaziland is 245 000 orphans after the parents who have died of AIDS.
HIV positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after the parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni found the association of Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them attending the school of the second degree.
For 15 or 20 per month can take over the patronage.
It guarantees the child tuition fees, school uniforms and one hot meal a day at the Gogo-centre.
Imbongi means in the language of the zulu "the narrator stories" or "the one who praises".
Gaseous bantuštinou fails in this space no one to talk to, just sing.
For almost ten years choir rehearsing the songs in this foreign soft speech, and sometimes it also brings back there, where originally come from: the south Africa.
In the airy distance of 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg is in the northeast of the kingdom of swaziland village Esitjeni, which is dependent on the power of the votes of the German corps.
Forty percent are infected with the
There are approximately 2000 people, some still in plain clay or straw chýších. A large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents, because they have succumbed to the virus HIV.
In Esitjeni is seen in the small, the stůně throughout Swaziland: the highest rate of infikovanosti HIV, the lowest life expectancy around the world, according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half the population does not accept.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland wear virus weakened immunity in itself. There is no rarity that die in less than thirty years.
This village appeared corps in the common way for Africa in the spring of 2005. Above all, however, the members of the Imbongi have seen many children on the streets, which lacked not only parental care, but quite everything: food, clothing, education.
Without the complete cycle of school education in a poor country have no chance whatsoever.
Initially, it still was a private deployment of individuals, which, for a few euros per year allowed to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
But a year later was founded choir association "Voices for Africa", which has since cares for the orphans after the parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
To bacterial SPI belong syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorea).
Frequent virus SPI, HIV, human papilomaviry, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Muňky and scabies belongs to the parazitárním SPI.
Who belongs to the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur primarily among men who have sex with men.
Institute of the Robert Koch institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five of all cases of syphilis, which have been reported in Germany, are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
For heterosexual adults are sexually transmitted diseases, which occur frequently, chlamydial infection, trichomonády, candidiasis (mold), gonorrhea and human papilomaviry.
HIV is among the heterosexuálními adults with us extended to relatively few, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV accounted for by this group.
Among minors with chlamydial infections occur more frequently than in other groups of the population.
According to european polls, three quarters of all infections of concern to young people from 15 to 25 years.
For us, moreover, between minors often occur human papilomaviry.
As it developed, the number of infections?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of infected syfilidou according to the Institute of the Robert Koch institute of 1697 disease in 2001, more than doubled to 3698 of the disease in the year 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV since 2007 reduced.
The year 2011 was about 2700 cases.
It is roughly one-tenth less than the year before.
What are the symptoms drawn to sexual disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty in urination, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and pustules or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and will remain, therefore, nezpozorovány.
How is it possible to protect yourself?
The danger of the disease can reduce the condoms, they do not offer, however, a wholly owned protection.
As the originators of the sexually transmitted diseases can be partially transferred infections from the dirt and the close physical contact.
Therefore, the experts recommend, in particular, in the case of frequent alternation of sexual partners, regular examination.
In the case of early diagnosis is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent the later consequences.
Through patronage, charitable donations and last but not least honorářům, that the choir earns chanting throughout Germany, gather some money.
"In total we have to Esitjeni sent about 200 000 euros," says president of the association of Annette Under.
Money from Germany manages the village itself Zodwa service has announced, confident woman, who can impose.
Caring for orphaned children have found shelter, for example, for some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as in the language of the zulu says the old women are the mainstay of the village.
Some of them took a 14 orphans, give them a roof over your head and take care of it, to children attend every day in a timely manner in uniforms to school.
The children that no one do not, go to the shelter to Khanyisile, a lonely woman, that is paid by the association as well as two cookbooks that day to cook for more than 200 of the hungry children.
"Voices for Africa" in addition, founded the school sewing, put the two kurníky and together with the american health organisation DOGS zařídilo that many people in the village had signed up to do an HIV test.
It is not a matter of course. Even if there is disease in the whole country so obvious, all about her silent.
The king 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Under "because it has everything to do with sexuality."
Actually pretty strange in a country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.
Last an absolutist monarch black Africa, king Mswati III., it is known for its nemírným lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-approved way of life bears, inter alia, also the blame on the fact that the HIV virus in the past decades so rapidly expanded.
But even many of the migrant workers, who have the virus roznesli around the country.
Annette Under the says that condoms are at every corner of the free, "but no one is not in use.
The culture is different - unprotected intercourse."
To at least a little bit of support cultural exchange, traveling choir Imbongi once every two, three years together after south Africa and sings songs full of sorrow, militancy, confidence in the future and self-esteem of black, which many in the southern tip of the black continent know from the times of apartheid.
A bus full of white people, who sing songs in the speech of the blacks - such awards brings not only the mood and joy, but also already vyloudilo tears for many of the wild frontier troops.
Road always leads to Esitjeni, where singers will visit the children, over which they have patronage.
Although this village are hard to find on the map, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is more than well-known.
"Go into the Esitjeni, there is light," say the people there.
And when you return to Heidelberg, which is away as the crow flies 8733 of kilometers, to dupajícím the singers in the service of the Bergheimer Strasse, you can see that the light shines here.
Messenger: NASA appeared on Mercury led
The probe Messenger found evidence that it is on the planet Mercury led.
Ice sheets could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The u.s. National aeronautics and space administration (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Even though it is situated closest to the Sun, and there is also a frozen water, as is apparent from the three studies, which on Thursday posted a specialized magazine "Science".
The probe Messenger found evidence for this, that in the field of this planet, which is in permanent shadow, there is the ice cover.
The latter is supposedly a minimum of 30 inches and maybe even up to 20 meters thick.
This water came under all of comets or perhaps even from the asteroids, which the Mercury encountered.
Nedávejme but the discovery of ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said the head of the scientists working on the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature of the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The findings, however, we may be able to help clarify how the water and other basic elements of life were given to other regions of the solar system.

Images of spiral galaxies according to their colour fastness become true works of art.

Our insights into the universe: the greatest telescopes
The telescope allegedly invented the year 1608 Hans Lipperhey. Before Galileo Galilei it a year later used for the observation of the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes still growing larger - and insights to convey, are getting deeper.
The largest telescope in the world was for a period of 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Haleův telescope at the Palomar observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture should average of five metres.
In the american Arizona is Large Binocular Telescope.
Provides an insight into the universe using just two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The inside of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary islands - La Palma is huge. Just a mirror measured in diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to uspořily costs.
Yet its average stands at around eleven metres.
The disadvantage of a cheap way of construction: the telescope is ensured hákovadlem in the altitude angle, thus it is restricted by its mobility.
In the altitude angle is fixed and telescope Hobby-Eberly in Texas.
Its peculiarity is high amplification of the light flow.

Search of clues in the country where they are 97letí people still relatively young.
Ride the mountains Talyš we can call it the wildly romantic.
Minibus rattled along the road with many curves along the densely wooded hills, predatory rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything is green and juicy, it almost seems that we are in the black forest.
But this is the furthest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.
Here lives caucasian ethnic group Talyšů, of which not too much is known, moreover, that speaks perfectly persky and ázerbájdžánsky and the lifespan is a very old age.
The ultimate destination is Lerik.
This small town is an awesome too monumental architecture of the soviet times, which is in the picturesque mountain landscape somehow did not fit.
Tourists from Europe come here not accessible. Arriving from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku city is too cumbersome.
The 323 kilometers is needed eight hours, because the road is only a machine.
Fabulous wealth, for which the country owes oil in the Caspian sea, come here to the countryside still have not arrived.
Pilata Fatulajeva (48) however, it is believed that, in the Lerik has to do it, to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku in may is famous for the Great price of Eurovision - and we here next year we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulajeva.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, about a single in the world.
Here is documented in the life of almost eight dozen Talyšů from the neighborhood, who are older than a hundred years. Fatulajeva shows a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years have fathered the child.
Controversial star of this museum is, however, seen sheep Şirali Müslümov, which allegedly was 168 years.
Birth certificate, however, does not exist.
And due to the fact that the oldest man in the documents was 122 years, it seems Müslümovův the age of extremely dubious.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and in 1973 he died," explains Fatulajeva.
This man was reportedly three times a blessed and had 23 children. At the age of 136 said to be even fathered a daughter.
Nezmýlil therefore Şirali Müslümov in its age of a few tens of years?
For many years people in Central Asia, however, heard and Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist Max Planck Institute in Rostock.
"A remarkably many people a high the age of lives, and in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia lives an extremely large number of very old men."
Due to the lack of supporting documents, however, is not amenable to scientific proof of age, especially when the lack register.
Every day a glass of melted butter
But the fact is that people in the area around the Leriku live biblical age strikingly often.
Currently, there are 20 people that are older than 100 years.
Why is living here in the south so much of aged people?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh this explains the specific genes Talyšů.
The director of the museum Fatuljeva on the contrary, believe, that it lies in the diet.
However, the fact that just calorie diet Talyšů who love meat, bread and mainly dairy products and many of which day to drink a glass of melted butter, is so healthy, from bromatologického point of view does not seem right credible.
Or is it the original way of life, which keeps people young? In Cengemiranu, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzajeva.
In 97 years on this latitude still relatively young.
Mirzajeva, which claims that it has 143 of the descendants, he lives in a plain wooden house, which is typical for the whole caucasian region.
Sitting on the ground with máselnicí, which tirelessly kolíbá.
Under one roof here lives of eight people, inter alia, one of the sons of Mirzajevy and daughter. Both are already a long time ago grandparents.
Around poskakují two small children.
In the kitchen for guests preparing tea, which is served in the typical břichatých jars "armadu".
White teeth Mirzajevy form the perfect line and under the scarf hides the long dark blond braids before us proudly reveals her son.
I always washed hair milk, so I looked and retain the color.
"I also never use the shampoo," says Mirzajeva.
The monthly pension for life just
She always just what came of its own courtyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
For all my life I've not one single time did not buy food in a supermarket.
Then tells me about your husband, who was in the army.
The worst of it was during the second world war.
But things have improved, when the oar took over the "beloved father" Gejdar Aliyev.
Propaganda sounds from the mouth of the old woman's weird.
However, the cult, which makes around the figure of the father of the nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows no bounds.
In power until 2003, then took the oar his son Ilham.
Old people in Azerbaijan at least do not suffer from poverty.
Mirzajeva receives each month pension 230 manatů (approximately the same amount in euros). It is on the local condition the amount of which can be easily make ends meet.
And maybe has a right to say a long time ago zešedivělý son Mirzajevy: "Old people enjoy in our culture, great esteem."
They live in the middle of a large family, you are loved, opečováváni and are happy.
If this is not the reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" in the constitution of the missing
In Cairo, she returned to the revolution.
Competing demonstrations in Cairo revealed a deep division of the country.
Sharply there is debate about the future constitution based on sharia law.
Egyptian president spared no pathos, questions.
We need to create a transition.
"And for that, we can do that, I am responsible before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but especially the christian Copts, liberal, enlightened muslims and secular parties.
They all, yet hopelessly rozhádaní in a confused opposition, namely the fear.
Fear before the "god's law" on the Nile issued at the mercy of the powerful Muslim brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologetic told that temporarily restrict the competence of the constitutional court and expanded ones their to "save the revolution".
But what wants to 61letý engineer, who has a degree of doctor of the american university of southern California, really save, in that they do not have the Egyptians nor the world clear.
To be deprived of the judiciary power?
234 points, which stohlavé the Constituent assembly, with a predominance of islamists hastily approved in patnáctihodinovém night marathon, partly arouse concern.
As well as in earlier constitutions, it is said in the proposal, that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of islamic law".
But what means "principle"?
It was and is a matter of interpretation and can be feared that the islamists have this vague formulation and associated with it forensics free space to be used for a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
At least it illuminates the newly added section: In all matters that relate to the sharia, it is necessary to consult with the university of al-Azhar, which is the most important islamic institutions in the country with great influence on the entire sunni islam.
It may not, but may mean that the clergy would carry out supervision over the legislation, which would be brought to justice de facto withdrawal of competence.
In the draft constitution is many things interpretation
The problem also is that it has to be to continue to maintain the civil jurisdiction of military courts.
These courts serve for Mubarakovy of the government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship in military custody until 11 000 civilians.
As stated in the proposal, the state should also protect the "true nature of egyptian families and to promote its morals and values."
It is legally formulated vaguely, that would use this section to the institutions of the state even control the content of the film art and literature.
In intelligible speech it does not mean anything other than censorship.
Indeed, no section in writing define explicit equality between men and women.
But another section prohibits defame or slander the prophet Muhammad and his envoy.
Unclear, however, remains, what is defamation and how will be prosecuted.
As well ambiguously acting formulation, that it is forbidden "insulting people".
Just in this case the cartoon of the president or a joke on account of the experts of the law?
Matter of interpretation, as many more in this proposal, which Morsi, shall submit to the signature and according to their words will be "very soon" to present the Egyptians, for the purpose of the popular vote.
"The revolution has returned"
Already a few weeks with the shapes of the opposition against the odds of the islamists.
Tens of thousands of people in unusual concord gathered on Friday in the evening in Tahrir square, Cairo, and pledged to destroy the constitutional charter, even before it starts to pay.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," he said Hamdín Sabbáhí, which is in the presidential elections placed on the third place.
Nobel laureate and former director general of the International atomic energy agency Mohamed Elbaradei has said that the draft constitution belongs "to the dustbin of history".
Through the service short messaging service Twitter has accused followers of His, that they want to carry out "a coup against democracy".
"If declare the referendum, we will go to his palace and svrhneme him," said the member of the opposition Yasser Said.
"We are not yet tired of the blood of our brethren is not yet punished," to quote the egyptian media in the opposition policy of the leader khaled Ali.
Some judges reported that they do not want to supervise the referendum, which would become invalid.
"The koran is our constitution"
Well organized by the Muslim brotherhood proclaimed vzdorodemonstraci, out of caution, however, not in Tahrir square, but after a public prayer at the second bank of the Nile before the cairo university.
It was attended many embraced women and supporters salafistů, who called: "the People of calls for application of god's law."
They called on the Morsi: "Cleanse the country!" and ubezpečovali: "the Koran is our constitution."
The fight for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir square, on which all started, would probably triggered a status similar to the civil war.
It's His followers apparently did not want to take the risk.
The muslim brotherhood said that the opponents and proponents of the draft constitution loudly and clearly expressed.
Now it is time to let the people at the ballot box to decide on which direction the country has to go.
For some it is considered to be the majority in favour of the proposal of the islamists.
"The word 'human rights' does not occur even once"
Forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, ročiluje Háfize Abu Sa'du.
Osmačtyřicetiletý human rights advocate and president of the egyptian Organization for human rights (EOHR) advocated the members of the Muslim brotherhood, when they were under Mubarak in prison or stood before the court.
Not because they shared their ideology, but because, for him, human rights are indivisible.
For this he was beaten, sentenced and imprisoned.
"And in the new constitution now are not the words 'human rights' even once," complains in an interview to "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi the extension of power on all three of the power component in the state has forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous crime against democratic rules of the game and Egypt will lead to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of to the president of the civil society strengthened in fact it aside," complains Sa'da.
However, without a civil society organisations can democracy work.
Sa'da feel abandoned, and the international community, which monitors the match ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
It should, he could backfire.
A protester in Tahrir square warns: "you have Created a monster that already you are unable to control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: the Most smelly fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoys one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
It could be the secret of the success of the country associated with the local appetite for extremely smelly fish?
Take a few over-ripened cheeses.
Place them into the middle of the pile of dirty and wet football kits.
Let this week lie.
So you get a paralyzing sense of smell the odor rakfisku, one of the largest Norwegian delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, wonderful views - and in the air hanging pervasive odor.
Rakfisk is nasolený trout fermented in the water for a period of up to one year - it depends on how much you want to put the fish smelled.
As it's getting dark and it's cold, starting with the Norwegians here in Fagernes meet at the festival dedicated to this, to say it best, nejpodmanivějšímu eat.
"If you eat it raw, and then it zapijete a aquavitu," says Havard Halvarsen, local professional fireman, but also the so-called "Rakfisk general", which is responsible for the conduct of the festival.
All around us people eat small cubes fish and washed down is a large amount of alcohol.
"Some people would rather have aquavit than rakfisk," says Havard.
Beverage can smell squish.
A few pieces I'll try.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it is similar to a piece of sushi, which was on a long bus trip.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different time, when it was in Norway poverty, and yet because there was a fridge, a fish in the fall namáčely into the airtight barrels with water, and salt.
Then in the middle of winter, when they were well-fermented, vytáhly and eaten - the senses is no doubt otupily alcohol.
Before a mere one of generations have been thousands of Norwegians forced to leave their land, and to search for work, while the majority emigrated to the United states.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants greatly help to attract incoming great amount of work, high earnings and a vast system of care.
The inhabitants of Sweden, old rival, which was not very long ago, much richer than that of Norway, flowing into the country for work.
On the rakfisk is regarded as something important, indispensable, even though quite smelly part of Norwegian past.
Among the more expensive dishes in the market.
Although expensive is everything - a small glass of beer or a sandwich you come out on 9 pounds ($14) per piece.
Norway is in the global reports often lacking and it seems that most of the residents it so suits.
Name Anders Breivik, right-wing racist extremists, which in the past year shot 77 men, women and children, the people here still mention grudgingly.
Instead, the shooting is called an "event of 22 July".
Norwegians can hardly believe that, in their peaceful country was one of them capable of such brutality and murder.
For the current wealth of Norway is the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries of the beginning of 70th years of the twentieth century.
"But oil is not the only reason, why we are doing so well," says during the administration of plates with uleželým rakfiskem our waitress Anna, who with his long blond hair and amazingly blue eyes represents the prototype of the alpine well-being.
We, as you said, thoughtful people.
Her English, as well as English most of the local people is absolutely impeccable.
Nepředvádíme is, we don't like ostentation.
Norway disposes of his oil-rich very carefully - in addition to a small percentage is most of the money from this sector invested in a special fund earmarked for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial crash threw money that they didn't, the Norwegians had a drawstring on his pouch firmly utažené.
"Until we can skiing in the winter and in the summer to go on trips, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with an easygoing laughing.
I stand in the snow in the queue for something to eat - rakfisku I already have enough.
Such a moose burger is definitely something different and is beautifully juicy.
But in the evening it is stinking fish again here.
A Hotel in which I live, is one of many places where is served rakfisk and dinner where guests elect the best, or rather for the sense of smell demanding fish.
Here they have a connection with the live tv transmission in which there is a moderator with a bow tie surrounded by a plate with rakfiskem.
It is like a singing competition the Eurovision.
"What kind of score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergene?"
"Here is our scoring, Havarde."
Echoes round of applause and laughter.
From the chair falls man, perhaps zmožený aquavitem.
Or maybe the fumes from all those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a tough start
As the incoming mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take over the office, staring Will Grant from the BBC on the challenges they are facing, and on the mixed expectations of their fellow citizens.
Airport in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is clogged even in the best of times, were erected the steel barriers closing some of the key routes to the capital city and causing chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not prevent dojíždějícím to get to work, but in order to prevent the protesters on access to parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto received the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.
Facing a challenging task.
Mexico at the time of the period of office of the outgoing Felipe Calderona performed well economically, the country is in the grip of the drug war, which have an estimated took the victim to 60 000 lives for six years.
"My government has against the mexican people a great deal of commitment in the reduction of violence," the president said Pena Nieto u.s. president Barack Obama in the Oval office at the beginning of this week.
I will suggest a new security strategy, which will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before you shook hands with the us president, received the president of the Pena Nieta political experience as governor of my home state of Mexico.
Views on the new leader are different even in his old homeland, lidnatém and a large state which surrounds the capital city.
Direct the man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo to him, the memories of the good.
The citizens of him attribute the development of tourism in the resort and build the infrastructure.
In the city you can now drive along one of the new highways, which let Pena Nieto build. These highways are a huge improvement from chasing after the perforated and hrbolatým roads that were previously.
The plate with his name also hangs on the wall of a modern sports centre and the impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect that it will bring about real and lasting change," says a friend and political ally of Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, the state deputy for the party of the president of the Pena Nieta, Hand institutionalized revolution (PRI).
Especially we hope for interesting and actual changes in the field of security and the economy, that our country so desperately needs.
After the uninterrupted 81 years in power was the party, the PRI pushed out of the Vicente Fox.
Member of Olvera admits that after 12 years out of the presidential palace Los Pinos is inside the party from Enriqua Pena Nieta many expected.
And rejects the expression of opposition characterizing the new president as a man without any substantial content.
This is a very straight forward person, very impressed with the excellent vision of the country.
It is a great statesman and mainly it is the man who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression, which has from his former governor of many people.
In Nezahualcoyotlu, also known as the Ciudad Neza, can not be a contrast with the cobbled streets of the Valle del Bravo evident.
Tucked under the dálničními overpasses in many ways reminds suburb itself the capital of Mexico.
And the problems in the autonomous village, there are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year was drafted into the army, to help with the management of drug-dealing gangs operating in the neighborhoods, especially poignant is violence against women.
Only in the last two years have been a waste places next to the huge dumps of waste pohozeny the body of dozens of murdered women.
At the time, when he was Pena Nieto governor, was in the state of Mexico murdered more than 1 000 women, which is much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In the best case, the critics Pena Nieta say that during your term in office, has failed to adequately addressing the problem of killings of women.
And, in the worst case, his leadership accuse of closing of the eyes.
In a concrete house, typical for the dilapidated district, mi Irinea Buendia shows photographs of her deceased daughter Mariana islands Luna and suppressing a cry.
According to the official version of the committed Mariana in 2010 suicide.
Her family, however, to believe that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, so it looked as if her body someone washed," recalls mrs Buendia.
Were signs after strikes and has already started to death stiffness.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana staring down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which is a single word: "Justice".
However, this is, as it says in the family, exactly what they had been denied.
The state authorities to me behave as if I was the old drbna, potížistka and kňouralka.
They want you to just accept what they say, and remained silent.
"But that can't be right, when there have been so many errors and omissions," he says.
The sash, which the president of the Pena Nieto Saturday receive, is accompanied by a sense of great responsibility.
In the last six years, there have been tens of thousands of families in Mexico affected by violent crime, and the new president has promised, that after the period of his tenure in office will be his priority.
"I hope, that it will be the same by the president, as was the governor," he says in the Valle del Bravo member of the PRI Olvera.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza afraid of the most.
Bradley Manning complained about ill-treatment, says the military prosecutor
The military prosecutor is trying to disprove the claims of Bradley Manning on the gross-treatment in custody.
Hearing focuses on Manningův stay in military custody in the city of Quantico, Virginia.
Defence wants to make the case was dismissed on the basis of gross treatment with Manningem in prison.
When private is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that the private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the biggest leak of secret material in the history of the US, has missed a lot of options to complain about the rough treatment that allegedly suffered in military custody.
The military prosecutor maj. Ashden Fein in cross-examination, the soldier Manning in a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede in Maryland claimed that the records of weekly visits, which Manning had with the officers of the unit, in the course of the nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination, which occurred in the course of the hearings carried out on the proposal of the defence rejected the case driven against the Mannings because of gross treatment at the time of detention, which in itself is a sufficient penalty, took place the day after Manning testified about the fact that in the custody of the thought of suicide.
Analyst army intelligence, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents in their ministry in Iraq.
The material was then published on-line on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never been confirmed, that Manning was the source of its information.
At Friday's hearing passed the military prosecutor Fein together with Manningem form, which the officers filled after the meeting with the Manningem in a detention facility in Quantico, where he was from July 2010 to April 2011 held in the mode of a high security.
Officers of the Mannings ask questions and to record his answers.
When it Fein on Friday on these forms asked Manning admitted that the treatment by their guards rated as "excellent" and the total treatment in the equipment rated as "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaints of ill-treatment, even when the officers Manning directly asked for it, the way he is treated claimed Fein.
Manning replied that the concerns regarding the problems expressed orally, and that the officers, who traveled with him about these concerns have spoken and they have indicated that they will deal with these problems, however, did not notice.
"Enrolled have "no problems" (after you discuss the concern), and it may not necessarily mean that I did not mention," said Manning.
Judge col. Denise Lind is Manning also like to ask why you on the treatment of his person complained in January 2011 at the meeting with the commission assessing suicidal thoughts, that a few months previously expressed in the form.
Manning replied that in the course of this meeting, it was his intention to achieve a reduction in the mode of "injury prevention".
The army said that for him this restrictive regime (one level below the regime of supervision due to suicide) used for its protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted to prison officers in custody to know that I am okay and that I wanted to cancel this mode of injury prevention... to be able to enjoy improved quality of life, as I saw it," said Manning.
Manning on Thursday to testify about his arrest in Iraq and the transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before he was transported to the detention camp at the base of the marine corps in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait considered suicide and once there because of the heat fainted.
Said, that it, that he was not able to know what to do with him going and what is happening in the outside world, it was very daunting.
"My world is whittled down only on the base of the Arifdžán, the cage," he said in a Thursday Manning.
I thought that in the cage I die.
Manning said that after the arrival to the Quantica spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often even longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any society.
Manning said that he was allowed only one mattress, duvet, flip flops, some clothes and glasses.
He said that he tried to walk, because sleeping or just lying in the course of the day against the legislation.
Manning said that he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in the eyes.
Said that, if the guard could not see his face, when in the night turned on the other hand, raised it and had to turn back.
Manningův legal representative filed a formal complaint to the treatment with the soldier Manningem in January 2011.
Manning was in April 2011 transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas.
On Friday, the judge Manning also asked about the allegations raised in Thursday's testimony, regarding the fact that, after he was forced to sleep one night in his cell at Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and the other my fellow prisoners in the morning counting.
Manning testified that during the counting, he was not allowed to cover his blanket.
In Friday's hearing, providing a judge of the Manning said that the order of his bodyguards, he concluded, that has a blanket, which could cover up to postpone, but admitted that his warrant to its postponement no one did not deliver.
On Thursday, Manning testified that was last night forced to sleep naked, because the officer tried to show that he is not dangerous.
Manning said that the officer said that he could use the waistband of his underwear or its flip flops to get hurt, but didn't do it.
Manning testified that that night was from his cell removed his underwear, his flip flops and sunglasses.
His legal representative hopes that the judge will take into account his experience of the course of his detention, and that in the event of his conviction before a military court, which is expected to start at the beginning of next year, will greatly reduce his sentence.
The defence stated that the plans that Manning admits to blame in the lower criminal offences and that they will fight against the rest of the accusations, because they are too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will defend detention conditions as legitimate.
The Pentagon said the statement, that Manning was held in accordance with the legislation all arrests held in custody with maximum security.
Among the charges brought against the Mannings include aiding the enemy, illegal causing the publication of the intelligence documents on the internet, the transmission of information related to national security and theft of public assets, or records.
If the accused in all the points can be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My crisis of the mexican-american identity
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico due to lack of options that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those they had gone; they resemble them hard times, he says.
Navarrette says that the mexican Americans are caught between the two worlds.
At last the way to the capital city of Mexico, I barely prodral the crowd and I arrived to the area for the agenda of immigrants, where I ran into a problem.
The arrow will point to one of two queues: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the second for the "Extranjeros" ("Strangers").
I stood there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in central California and throughout my life I've been called "Mexičanem".
It is the ethnic stands, the same as when my friends in Boston called "Irish" and my friends in New York refer to themselves as "Russia".
So later I ended up with the designation "mexican American".
But this was Mexico.
And in the homeland of my grandfather was not necessary to use shortcuts.
I was simply American.
I speak Spanish well enough that I mastered both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary native speaker and I can't get rid of the accent.
So I pulled my american passport and stood in the queue for the "Extranjeros".
I was thinking about the moment when this week, the newly elected mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited in the White house president Obama.
The programme had the usual matters to discuss, when the leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs, and commerce.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why is the same probability that the Mexicans will remain in Mexico, as that travel to the United states.
He wants to join with the United states and Canada, and to create in the North America business block similar to the European union.
And Pena Nieto has promised, that will continue in the mexican war against the drug cartels, although did not provide any details.
For Mexico is the relationship with the United states complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never nepomyslela to the fact that in the year 1848, the United states invaded Mexico and forced its leader under the threat of weapons to rewrite half of mexico's territory to the United states.
But for the Mexicans, who thinks in the range of centuries, not minutes, are the comments of the ubiquitous.
So a minute after the representative of the United states says something just a little bit critical of Mexico, you will hear in the mexican press and among the elite of the complaint on how Americans interfere in the sovereignty of his neighbor.
And children Montezumy off to a good start on the war path.
And yet it is for Mexico, the real challenge of the relationship for more than 35 millions of mexican Americans living in the United states.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There is a lot of.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, the people of the country offering the options, and others, which are not.
The only reason why so many people with mexican roots live in towns and cities, such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that in any point of our family tree was a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, which was in Mexico denied the opportunity and had to go to the north.
And more often than it seemed, this person fit the profile of the dark skin, weak education, the origin of the poor of the village etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to.
Not against Mexico.
And even though we are now living the american dream, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the american dream, not mexican.
Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It is against the United states.
And outside of that, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class of the us does not like.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and look upon us as a menial race, which is not sufficiently mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
Our existence is, in their opinion only on failure.
If our families in Mexico neselhaly, so it never left.
And we should now they did not find anything trapped behind the silk curtain, with the good life in the United states, but i still lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, in the childhood legally arrived in the United states, reminds me that between the Mexicans and mexican-Americans, there are tensions, because the Mexicans more understanding of who they are, and mexican Americans resent.
Although it is a national of the United states, he sees himself as part of the two countries.
And at the same time a lot of mexican Americans, that I know of, does not feel like a part of one.
We love listening to mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteena.
You get the best of both countries, but the roots you don't even have one.
In Mexico, the us is viewed as Americans.
And in the United states are considered to be the Mexicans.
And to make the relationship even more complicate, they want to get some mexican leaders and the part of the intelligence, as I have during their trip learned again associate with the diaspora.
Want to mexican Americans worked for Mexico as a "makeshift the ambassadors" and imagined the mexican interests in the United states.
We should say our american fellow citizens, how great is to visit the country, and to push political leaders, to establish relations with Mexico.
No.
It is, therefore, not going to happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and rampant corruption and the drug violence many of us is not certain that this is a great country.
I have such a feeling that it's up to you, amigos.
It is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United states, as they did with Mexico before one and a half centuries, so must accept the fact that some mexican Americans still feel indignation for the way it dealt with the members of their family in substantially closer to the past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are more "Mexicans"than I thought.
The old battles, the new Middle east
Cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could still be uncertain basis for peace.
Can ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle east?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such happening is in vain.
Among the usual useless conjecture about who started it, it was many of the buildings changed in the debris, the killing of more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, hezbollah rockets from the Gaza strip near Tel Aviv, the israeli metropolis, and in the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even when it seems that the Israelis and the Palestinians are stuck in their ancient conflict, everywhere around them the Middle east is changing.
The arab spring has changed the old ways and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the ensuing chaos in the region.
Maybe it will cause, that their struggle will be even krvavější than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that this may interrupt their deadly stalemate.
The war, which is neither won nor lost.
At first glance it seems that currently there are not many reasons to be in optimism.
Even if the cease-fire concluded 21 November lasted, the fight of this week strengthen the hawks on both sides.
Leaders of Hamas, the islamic movement in Gaza is ruled by since 2007, will argue that forced the Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza has suffered a defeat.
Despite the killing of several leaders of Hamas and the conclusion of the 1.7 million residents of the Gaza strip in one of the nejžalostnějších and the most populous parts of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by its embedded rivals Fatah, the more moderate palestinian factions.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas very well conclude that the time is on their side.
The islamists throughout the arab world have gained a greater impact, so that Hamas won the powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, znovuvzkříšená regional power, which once was the closest muslim ally of Israel, are added to the side of Hamas. Similarly, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Cheering people from Hamas say that the islamic crescent encircling around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where reigns the party/the militia Hezbollah via Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly inclined to islamizmu, can depose Bashar al-Assad, to the Jordan, where the allies Hamas to threaten the king.
And, above all, on the southern wing of the Israel changed the rise of the Muslim brotherhood, under the leadership of president Mohammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous, and the flagship of the arab countries, the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who in Egypt ruled for 30 years until its collapse in the year 2011, not on Hamas time.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is the cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more vulnerable to public opinion.
In the future diplomacy may Hamas appear as a player, which can not be excluded nor Israel or America.
On the contrary, israeli hardliners come to opposite conclusions.
In military terminology was Hamas deposited back into the crate.
The israeli anti-missile system in the Iron dome proved their worth and a lot of Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
The israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In the diplomatic terminology America is as indestructible as always. Many european countries also vinilo Hamas from the commencement of the last round of violence.
And mainly - Israel prospered, in particular, under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, that the peace process is mostly ignored.
Even when the rockets from the Gaza strip since 2004, killing about 30 Israelis, was in Israel to be relatively calm since the suicide bombing bombers, thanks in part to the wall, which extends into the West bank, the main part of what once might be a palestinian state, and protects the jewish settlements, which are still growing despite its illegality before international law.
Prime minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party at the beginning of the campaign in the elections held on 22 January teamed up with even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why spoil those treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West bank, so would neodpalovali rockets, as they did their compatriots in Gaza?
It will be better if we stick to the walls and praštíme is, when he sticks his head.
Maybe hardliners win, but the arab spring can make their calculations change.
Although the islamists, who are gaining power in Egypt and in other countries, do not have Israel too in love, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
The israeli defense expenditures are higher than the expenditure of all its four arab neighbors together.
The launch of a new war with the local superpower hardly helps the new arab governments to heal its economy.
The president of the Morsi collaborated with president Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire, it is a good sign, and may mark the beginning of something new.
Also, the Israelis would be in the given situation should watch from a long-term point of view.
At a time when the rest of the arab world becoming more democratic, creating a denial of the rights of the Palestinians to self-determination powder keg, which must one day in the areas occupied by Israel explode - as well as bus, which last week to burst out in Tel Aviv.
Already in the present repression weaken in the jewish state, democracy and the demographics of this situation even worse, as the arab population grows.
The bloody attack on Gaza to be held every few years for the purpose of pushing Hamas will increasingly choose to diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what they preach reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world and the following newspapers: the two states, when Israel cedes territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is little hope that the ceasefire will provide the pressures from the outside at least a little bit of greater influence on the enforcement of this matter.
Egypt, which together with Turkey and Qatar must deliver on stopping the supply of weapons into Gaza, has a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country, and of a shared Jerusalem.
The arabs from the outside also must push on the conformity between Hamas and Fatah.
It would be for the creation of a palestinian state has done more than the immediate offer of a virtual state sovereignty in the UN.
President Obama also has its part on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term he had neglected the performance of their own peace plan.
Now, back in the White house seems to be as reluctant in its entry into the process.
It is woefully short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle east.
It means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia entered into force the laws of ugly cigarette packaging
The unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, are depicted warnings for smokers and the diseased part of the body.
Entry into force of the australian laws of ugly packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, and the logos and colors brands have replaced the general olive-green krabičkami with ohavnými pictures of diseased parts of the body and display of the newborn and child onemocnělých as a result of smoking their parents.
In addition to a variety of health warnings and the images are mandatory since Saturday, the only difference between the krabičkami brand names, which are printed in the same small print.
This is the strictest regime in the world concerning the packaging of tobacco.
The australian federal government argues that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by the fact that this habit gets rid of its attractiveness.
Relying on studies that show that when people start to smoke up to 26 years of age, is a 99% chance that do not start to smoke, never did.
"Even in very young children you can see, that means the message to them, the tobacco companies seeking together with your product to sell," says the federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, and quotes a study, for example, have shown that children unite the crown in a log file with the idea for it to be a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world, and the changes will have only a small impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering the introduction of similar actions.
The tobacco industry against the introduction of these laws lobbied hard.
Tobacco companies argued that this law will increase the trading on the black market, which will lead to cheaper and more abundant cigarettes.
"Thanks to this legislation the event of significant unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre from British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia to bring a lot more of these products, which will be sold on the australian streets.
Other claims, that the laws of increased their shops.
Sandra Ha of the company Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand on cigarette packaging of silicone is used to cover the nasty boxes, two months ago, when the company British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco has lost its appeal concerning the laws to the australian supreme court, has increased from almost zero sales.
Ha said that the company Zico has sold nearly 6 000 pieces of wholesale dealers and expects the new stock.
For us, it is a good deal.
As a possible snag experts have reported the popularity of social media for this demographic group to which the plan aims.
After a whole range of australian law prohibits television advertising, sponsorship of sports events and demanding that most of the vendors hid cigarettes from direct vision to tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned the internet advertising by local companies and websites, however, it may not restrict the foreign site.
"If you're marketing a worker in the tobacco industry and it only remains for you only this small space for the promotion of your products, it is for you as an online space unrivaled location in which you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in the field of public health at the university of Sydney.
Mrs Freeman has made to increase the ranking of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, carried out by the "average Jan".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and gave you the job and created this video, or that is involved in the marketing company?
The company British American Tobacco Australia argues that the industry has focused on how to decide what to do with the new rules, than on marketing.
The industry has gone so far, that paid to Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican republic under the attack of the new legislation - the country in the framework of the World trade organization declare that business is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia significantly not traded.
The handing down of the decision SOO is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek said that the government held talks with other governments, which are considering similar laws relating to packaging.
Canada was the first country, which in 2001 has introduced a mandatory warning photos.
Now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Stricter laws are considering United Kingdom, New Zealand, South africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia is resisting.
The pictures on me, have no influence.
Simply ignoring.
"Just think, you pull out a cigarette and a box of strčíte back," says Victor El Hage when buying the box with the photos of the tumor in the mouth.
Frankly, is just one more reason to quit smoking, and this is my little daughter.
James Yu, who own a newsagent's the King of the Pack in the heart of Sydney, argues that thanks to the single packaging for him the more difficult it is to cope in racks.
"The unloading of the cargo, it took me one hour, now give it takes four hours," said Yu.
"The government should simply had to completely disable, then we said ,OK, this is the end, we close the shop'," he said, and threw up his hands.
In a world of continuous connection is not so bad to be bored
The last Day of thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport, though it was our plane mechanical trouble and we had to wait for the arrival of another aircraft.
So we had plenty of time to think about the boredom.
I will not lie to you.
Wait half a day at the airport for the next years is pretty annoying, despite the distraction of books, magazines and how (not to mention the duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on children's development of increasingly more come with praise nudění.
They say that for us (and our children) is a good idea to occasionally get bored.
Forcing the brain to go into the interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And due to the fact that most of us nowadays is constantly connected to any screen, we have no chance of boredom enjoy.
Therefore, we should boredom support?
Yes.
And not.
But I will return to this.
First of all, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon, which occurred with the advent of more free time.
But as Peter tells us Toohey, a professor of Greek and roman history of the canadian university of Calgary, who is the author of the book of Boredom: And Lively History of boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact has a boring long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found the Latin inscription on boredom, dating from the first century of our era.
And then there is also the question of how we define the boredom.
The difficulty is in the fact, that has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After visiting the research literature and demonstration of the thoughts of the target group of about 100 people, a professor of Eastwood and his colleagues defined the boredom as the experience of the "I wanted to do something that would make me satisfied, but not I am able".
Boredom from apathy distinguishes itself by the fact that the person is not into anything involved, but I would be.
He says that with apathy, there is the urge to do something.
He says that the core of the boredom is a "distortion of the process of attention, united with a bad mood, and a sense of slow passing of time."
Boredom can make a lot remind depression.
But the professor Eastwood said that while they may have a mutual relationship, have nudící people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed, sees a problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think that nudíme, when we only have difficulty concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, professor Eastwood and his colleagues have pointed to the earlier experiment, during which participants listened to the tape, on which the person reading the article from the magazine.
Some of the group heard loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others hear it so quiet, that it hardly noticed, while a third group did not hear at all.
Those who television program heard softly, reported more boredom than the other two groups - have had difficulty in concentrating, but they weren't sure why, and giving these difficulties boredom.
When you are trying to concentrate on the difficult or exciting task, intrusion attention lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you are doing something boring, "as is the search for the bad components on the factory line, can distracting music to help keep you busy."
In fact, he said, now we know, that twist and doodling, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can in fact help with the fight boredom and keep people physically more attentive.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to wiggle, to learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit in peace," said professor Fenske.
All we ever boredom experienced - delayed my flight, roaring speaker, especially the lengthy film.
But some individuals have a greater chance to be bored than the other.
For assistance with the measurement of boredom scientists in the 80s of the last century have developed "Scale for susceptibility to nudění" (Boredom Proneness Scale).
The scale includes questions such as: "a Lot of things that I need to do, is repeated and it is a monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time for them all to do.".
Using these scales, the researchers found that boys have a tendency to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and especially as regards the need to have more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers are, however, generally indifferent.
In 1991 Reed Larson, professor for human and social development at the University of Illinois, has conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times a day contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents.
Found that 32 percent of teens reported that they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they are bored, when they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents reported that they were bored.
Professor Larson said that he does not know whether the percentage of boredom was now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
Said but that he knows that "adolescence is the time for boredom", which is to a large extent due to the fact that children and young people are not being given a lot of control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Is it for you to boredom good?".
As research shows, sometimes not, because, in their extreme form can lead people to do, to undergo an absurd physical risks, played a game of chance or abuse of addictive substances as a way to relieve it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discuss the connection between boredom and creativity, said professor Vodanovich that the problem studied for more than two decades.
"Boring is the way the brain, how to tell you, that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain does not always know the most suitable thing you should do.
If you're bored and you use this energy to playing the guitar and cooking, you will get it to make you happy.
However, if you watch television, will make you happy for a little while, not long term.
So if your baby bored and give him the iPad, I will not be bored, but they do not learn how to itself to seize or to independently manage, said professor Fenske.
And, "this self-management is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child will learn only how to itself entertain, but to gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think that we really want to celebrate the boredom.
But neither we, with respect to it should not be too critical.
Our aim should rather be to feel comfortable when we are out of the reach of the constant rattling activities and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse it of the needs of the bored even more, but boring is painful, restless desire to be connected with something meaningful," he said.
What people actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy your free time.
"In the environment in which we are constantly přestimulovaní," he said, "it is hard to find ways to entertain, when the noise stopped."
In Colorado there is no guide regarding the new law on marijuana
Their Anthony Orozco, a student at the higher school and soccer player from the south-east of Colorado, is facing criminal charges for something that will be soon in the entire state of the legal - for the possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe, which he used on her smoking.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September drove with a few friends in the Lamaru, on the plains near the border with Kansasem, when he was stopped.
After a policeman found in the car marijuana, was mr. Orozco issued a summons for possession of drugs and equipment to drug use - minor offences, for which it is for each fined 100 USD - and he was determined the date of the court.
"They treated us like criminals," said mr. Orozco.
But it is a criminal?
In uncertain weeks after the vote, colorado legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use depends answer hundreds of smaller drug cases rather than on the law.
Hundreds of cases of offences for possession of marijuana was already here and in Washington state, which has been approved by similar measures, was annulled.
The police department has ceased to blame the adults at the age of 21 years and older for possession of a small amount, which will be legally permitted after the law in the coming weeks will enter into force.
But the plaintiffs in conservative districts of Colorado have said that they will continue with the existing cases involving marijuana, and still accuse people for possession.
At the same time several cities of the suburbs of Denver towards the western mountains to vote on the prevention of the opening of the new, state-licensed shops with marijuana in their communities.
"This matter is evolving so fast that I don't know what will happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in the town of Aurora, east of Denver.
The heads of you drbou and regulators in the state of Washington.
And looking for instructions on how to set up a licensing system for the cultivation, production, distribution and sales - all within the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that the Colorado, whether in a good or in a bad way, is ahead of the majority of states in the regulation of marijuana, first of all, for medical use, and now also for recreation.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the council for the granting of licences for the sale of alcohol to the state of Washington.
But as mr. Smith admitted, no place or the system can not do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent, according to which we could manage,"he said.
The washington law, the so-called. I-502, shall take effect on the 6th of December, which also leaves the annual vacuum, during which still will not be a state licensing system, but the legal possession of yes.
And there are complicated mechanical issues, which must be in the course of this time resolved, such as how to balance the directive of the state concerning the "appropriate access" to the licensed marijuana with its ban on trade with hemp to 330 feet away from schools, parks, playgrounds for children or children's centres.
"Nowhere will not be difficult to place a licensed shop with cannabis than in urban areas, and especially in the metropolitan areas of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for legal hemp, recently based research group.
November 21, sent police chief Oates from the city of Aurora its officers, e-mail, in which they announced that the city of the plaintiff no longer prosecute offences for possession of small amounts of marijuana for each citizen of the elder age of 21, and that the police "with immediate effect" stop blaming people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police will enforce the municipal laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In the district of Weld in northern Colorado represents the district attorney Ken Buck more stringent view.
After the vote, said that his office would continue in the prosecution of cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way to push for users to seek treatment.
Currently facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, even if many of them are facing the other accusations.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal wrongdoing, which was offences at the time when they occurred," said mr. Buck in his statement.
The reaction was complicated even in places like rural district Mesa, where voters rejected the marihuanovou initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest town of the district, has already adults blame for possession of a small amount.
The district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, this decision supports, but also decided to nezamítnout all ongoing cases of possession.
"I don't think that I'm losing my time continuing the enforcement of the law, until it is not going to change," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the coloradských voters measures supported, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of government and the legal system will never be simple.
And contradictory response across the state have revealed with regard to this great state green experiment deep ambivalence among local officials.
For the district prosecutors this is the "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, which stands accused of possession of marijuana, and local spokesman for the National organization for the reform of laws relating to marijuana.
"We spent so much of his life to the persecution of the people, that they still can not actually accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states, which are of small quantities of marijuana, are to alcohol, Colorado and Washington on the best way to become national test cases for the legalization of drugs.
Defenders and state authorities are planning a new frontier for legalizovaný sales and at the same time also anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which still has a plan to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes.
Advocates of legalization of marijuana are hoping that the ministry of justice, complies.
Despite the arrest of several vendors of marijuana for medical purposes and patients who are taking that attract attention, leaving the majority of the federal government shops with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and other 16 states in the operation.
While protidrogoví agents are not likely to kick down the door to picking up the small bag with the drug, it is likely that a's future enable the state of the regulated trades with recreational marijuana authorised by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former advisor in the field of drug policy of the administration of president Obama.
Several coloradských cities does not wait for the procedure of the federal authorities.
Even prior to the election day some local governments have approved a moratorium on any new shops with marijuana, although it will still take about a year before he will be able to any store to open.
Last week the town of Montrose to the west of the state proposed a six-month ban and it is likely that the next week will enter into force.
"We do not want to find themselves in a situation where someone we will issue a license and then we will have a big federal matter," said Bob Nicholson, member of the municipal council.
Our village voted against this appendix.
We look at it, for what voted the village, compared to what voted by the state.
There's really a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I Was forced to leave from Oxford, because I am a conservative."
For your opinions are not attacked only today's university students.
I do not remember, that I would ever nesnila about studying at the university of Oxford.
My father, so my older brother had studied at the university, of which I thought would be the biggest in the world based knowledge, modern ovíněné the Greek symposium motivating the two pillars of civilization, of free thinking and tolerance.
And so far I have at the end of the 80s of the twentieth century, within two weeks after the onset of the Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed suitcases and vřítila I to the first scandal of his life.
My father broke down and wept.
My friends were confused.
The newspaper the Evening Standard claimed that I gave up, because I had objections against the lovemaking of students in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson mischievously said, I left, because I was forced to drink from a chipped cups.
The truth was less a comic.
I ran off.
Yes, I ran off, because I was the subject of systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of their somewhat bizarre name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason only, and in this cradle of the alleged enlightenment that was how bigoted, so barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was the senior advisor to Margaret Thatcher, and I am a supporter of the Conservative party.
You may ask, why it vytahuji up to now.
Simply because of the recent reports suggest that the new generation of students to the right from the center of the suffering this kind of persecution.
Institutionalised and the growing hatred of the conservative students at Oxford, is so great that last week a group of these students seeking to equal protection of the equal rights for the gay men, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of the association of younger ones (JCR) at Corpus Christi College argues that, because of their political views are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks, and they made clear that they are not welcome".
Asking for the creation of the position in the university of the committee for equal opportunities, which would ensure that their views can freely communicate.
Their situation is not helped by the recently referred to the agenda of the documentary television BBC Two named Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (fairy-tale country: young, intelligent and right-wing) the student political events, which the conservatives portrayed as weirdos and neonacisty.
In the agenda was introduced by the graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (conservative association of the university of Oxford - OUCA), which drove a Rolls-Royce, he was dressed in a silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
On the other universities of the conservative students say, that it is with them because of the introduction of higher tuition fees are treated as "scapegoats".
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of Nottingham University Conservative Association (conservative association Nottinghamské university), told a Sunday newspaper that the "leftist influence in the universities is growing.
People believe that we as the Bullingdon Club, without us ever met."
Jednadvacetiletý history student at the Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who stands behind the movement for greater protection, says that such a climate is "uncomfortable", while a nineteen year old elected president of the OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that in the access of the members of the JCR against the people of the right of the centre there was a worsening.
"It poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as for the welfare of the members," he says.
During your first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I took in September 1986, 18letá and the crippling way shy.
Hatred towards the Conservative side was nejhorečnatější.
The year before university, voted to the refusal to grant the honorary title of the former student of Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in funding for higher education.
From the atmosphere, would i stalinisté tremble concern.
During the first few days in the first week where new students associating among themselves and with professors, I got a taste of wormwood, which was for to come.
I've found that not only the professors tacitly approving the prodding of the conservative pupils, but with the taste of him and participating.
The wood obložených of the classroom was brought to the policy of mining strikes, privatization, and the resistance of the government to the sanctions against the apartheid in South africa.
My first lecture concerned the translation of the French text from the 18th century to the English and at what followed, I was not prepared.
"Miss Wyatt," said professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), the "fold please first paragraph."
It was for me, it's tough enough.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like etc dough, was a lot of žlučovitý.
"Thatcherovci refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students hihňali.
In your eyes I draly tears.
"I suggest you get in her free time, she took some of the basic lessons of French, so if you're not too busy social issues," he growled professor Pitt.
Unnerved, I returned to my room.
At dinner in the school, I was alone, when I'm special light tap on the shoulder.
It was the student of the second year of the named James, who introduced as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said amiably.
Unfortunately this is so.
Anyone who is suspected of conservatism, is the target.
For me it is bad enough, but to know that your father is close to the Margaret Thatcher, so for you it will be even worse.
Most of the conservative freshmen pretending that they are labouristi.
Later in the local pub, I lily-livered try and pretend.
I have insisted on the fact that I do not agree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick is proved unsuccessful.
First year Student of the field of philosophy, politics and economics, which (how ironic) went to Eton, he said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
Other students with him notovali.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How conservatives love?" asked one.
Hitting one another, right?
I felt so, how to feel homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
I could sometimes lead in Oxford normal life?
I would be forced to meet with like-minded people, just after dark?
I would have needed to change in labouristu and suppress their natural inclinations?
Three years before me develop as a purgatory ignoring and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who lived on my faculty.
He was hated not only for it, that is a conservative, but i think it is an advisor to Margaret Thatcher on foreign policy and one of those, who write speeches.
Almost wasn't there.
This place hated for his provinčnost and pettiness and for its commitment to marxist-deterministickému point of view on the history.
In 1997 he took the position of professor at the Bilkentské university in the Turkish Ankara.
"You will not be happy here," he told me.
I started to commute from Oxford to the house of his parents in London, hledajíc shelter of their non-partisan metropolitan of friends and family.
I told the father that the Oxford hate and why.
I couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the forties were accepted from all political views.
"But after all, it is the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
It would not done, not in the city dreamy mood.
Even my communist friends had always had a perfect ways.
His zvlhlé eyes zasmušily.
Try it yet.
I am sure that it is just a prank.
It broke me heart, if you had gone.
Worn out by frequent trips to London with my emotional resistance to deteriorate.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative party, he succumbed to the pressure and gave up his belief.
The following week during the teaching, when the other a professor of history in complete seriousness of the declared that I "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I was inside the červenala shame, granted I have to do that to me "parents vymyli the brain" and I called it the "old fools".
The relief was short-term.
The nail in the coffin of my oxford career hammered out my father.
At that time he wrote every week two sloupečky to Murdochových of the newspaper.
My door was locked.
I cringed inside and after five minutes of my pursuers give up.
When they left, I packed my backpack suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can have me called usmrkaným slabochem.
But no 18letá girl or boy should not be in the educational institute subjected to such intimidation and toxicity.
Even more tragic is, however, that it was Oxford, from which not only resulted in 14 of conservative prime ministers, but also, to date, hiding behind the undeserved reputation of the place with the equality and freedom of thinking.

The hardest profession in the world: medium sulphur in the area of the volcano Kawah Ijen
For four of the euro hazardují medium in the field of the indonesian volcano with their lives and health when tolerate 70 pounds of sulfur down the steep stone paths.
Are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners, who make their living exploitation of the sulphur content of the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the indonesian island of Java.
Because of this each and every day fárat to the bottom of the crater, where the escape of sulphurous gases from inside the Earth and when in contact with air passes into the solid state.
After vyseká large blocks of sulphur, which together weigh up to 70 pounds, carries away, it is on the shoulders of two bamboo baskets after the steep stone paths.
To the top of the volcano, which rises 2 386 metres, it is just 250 metres away, but vyčerpaným porter takes over 40 minutes before vystoupají turtle pace up, because they maintain the balance and thoroughly rozvažují their steps to neuklouzli and nezřítili into the abyss.
They know that any stumble could become life, as it happened one of the French turistce, which years ago, came crashing down from the rocks Kawah Ijen.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for each pounds of sulfur, which the winners
When you are at the top, making your way around the tourists, who is photographing, as if they were monkeys in the circus, and fatigue can carry the heavy baskets to weight gain, which the mining company ranked slightly lower, at an altitude of 1850 metres.
This is a business PT Candi Ngrimbi, which in the volcano profited since the 1960s and never pay their workers more than 662 indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.
Then it sells for 10 000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fun fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even in the teeth of sugar.
"Because they are commonly worn by 70 pounds, we can earn you about 46 000 rupees (3,8 eur) for each path," explains us Anto, which usually completes the three-way front desk.
One way he takes three hours and at the end is destroyed, but can you then earn 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Even though this seems like an insignificant amount for such inhuman efforts, it is three times what they would have earned on the field.
"The daily wage of the miners is here very high. For example, for the collection of the coffee is paid 15 000 rupees (1,2 euros) per day and the salary for a fortnight is two million rupees (167 eur)," explains the carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a mason.
There was his salary of 75 000 rupees (6,2 million) per day, and work was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, from the serious reason, which is in Indonesia as compelling as sulphur: "I'm Married with a young girl of Bali, which is a hindu, and I took it., make converted to islam."
Anto has asthma, wrong he breathes, still coughing and the eyes are irritated by toxic gases
In its 27 years Anto three times a day, risking a life in the volcano Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur has already started to take its toll, although my face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
Has asthma, wrong he breathes, still coughing and the eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
This is the price you must pay for it to achieve his dream.
"I will work for two years, because I want to open a business or to study Spanish or French," promises more than a passable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man stižený fate could be a tourist guide, the waiter or with the concierge at the hotel, and instead of doing the work of the media.
Shares dirty wooden shack with other medium, and every day he gets up at two o'clock in the morning, because of the sulfur in the night continues to bubble and its characteristic yellow color is changing in blue and September of darkness.
Despite the surrounding darkness pharaoh Anto into the crater and illuminates the way a small lamp, which has mounted on the helmet itself it for your money bought.
About 400 media yields on the shoulders of the basket with the sulfur from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has a high income, the extraction of sulfur due to cost savings nezmechanizovala, or provide to the carriers working on their own and with such zeal, no equipment.
Actually even do not receive a share from 30 000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the extra charge for the shooting, which, together with a ticket for 15 000 rupees (1,2 million) collected by guards of the natural park from the tourists, who come to enjoy the pictures taken volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for the cattle, and not for the people," he said Madrusin, hefty 42letý carrier, which works in Kawah Ijen the past three decades, from the moment when he left the school.
Can handle the lift up to 110 pounds, and he assures us that the last work, "as long as it will go," because he needs the money on the education of his three sons, aged between 18 and 10 years ago.
I will not go into retirement, I was going to die here, because the volcano was my whole life
Although sulphur throat burns and stings in the eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and catches hold of the miners in dense výparech, which from the volcano are based on, the miners are so tough that no one of them does not complain that they suffer from serious illnesses... it is, however, evident from their frequent respiratory troubles, arthritis, pain in the knees and ran on the shoulders caused by the weight of baskets.
Unainik, which balances its basket on the back, you in its 53 years may deal only 50 pounds.
Every day he and his colleagues vydolují in the volcano 15 tonnes of sulfur, which then three trucks by the steep path between the thickets to a warehouse in Tamansari distant 18 kilometers.
"I will not go into retirement, I was going to die here, because the volcano has been my whole life," he declares Unainik and opens while the community at large mouth, in which missing a few teeth.
Of his five sons, the oldest, the thirty-year, also earns mining of sulfur.
Time passes, but ustavičná the misery of one of the most difficult crafts in the world continues from generation to generation - crafts, which carry out human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore raises babies, in order to save the economy
Singapurci are that they do not have children, career, stress, and the cost of living, and education.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am married and I am a patriot, you are my wife, and you are vlastenka. Splňme their civic duty and zploďme a new life!
It may seem incredible that this is the slogan of a part of advertising on also candies, but despite - or perhaps because of - the video earlier this year in Singapore the mass spread on YouTube.
These sentences are part of the rap, which uses local cues of the type "we put a bun in the oven" as a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
Advertising agency BBH, which video created, hopes to them by this advertising will manage to draw attention to the problem of a witty way.
The artistic director of the agency Douglas Hamilton says, that he wanted to use the influence of the music to enable people to fulfill "their civic duty".
"This is exclusively a matter for the internet, so it had to be fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem of this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we had a feeling that this is a topic that we must touch it.
We knew that the government had tried to about a lot of things like expand perfumes with pheromones or organize dating parties.
Many of these ideas can be creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, why not make here the most creative possible thing, as is the composition of the rap, in order to tackle this problem."
1.2 the children
The one who does not take much lightly, it is the government of singapore.
Annually make 1 300 USD to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government's package for marriage and family provides up to 15 000 dollars for the child, extended maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
All these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a rich city-state with a mature technology in the south-east Asia, also known konzervatizmem of its leaders and strict social controls.
Fertility rates in Singapore with regard to the stratification of the population is at the moment of 1.2 children per woman.
The last time exceeded the birth rate of the value of 2, which is considered as a degree of recovery in 1976.
Why Singapurci do not have more children?
Tan Wei Mingová, director of the department of marriage and the family to the National office for the population says that it is due to "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"People have available to a wider range of options when it comes to environmental goals and priorities, it is not only a wedding and family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of free people and to the postponement of marriage and procreation of children. The result is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While in the context of immigration policy, there were efforts to drastically increase the inflow of immigrants as a measure against the decline in the number of the population, between the local inhabitants it has provoked the displeasure.
On some of the singapore website is to see neskrývaná xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for the maintenance of low salaries and little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the last year has seen a party of government of Singapore for its worst election result since the beginning of independence.
After the elections appeared effort to solve the problem using quotas and higher charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in the birth rate has known impacts on national economic growth, tax revenues, expenditures in the health sector, and the politics of immigration, in the case of Singapore has also encountered some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to nestavělo so many small houses.
Started, for example, affect the real estate business.
The office for urban development began to regulate the number of small apartments, known as the "shoebox", which can build in certain urban areas.
These apartments have area of 46 square metres and had a great success in marketability.
However, there is a fear that these apartments can support mládenecký lifestyle and discourage developers, in order to build a large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, general director of development of the company EL Developers claim that their "shoebox" are sold far more quickly than the larger houses.
"Are popular, and it thus, that shall be sold on for days to weeks faster than houses with a larger area.
Therefore, for our cash flow much better."
However, admits that the new standards set clearer rules to developers, who were previously limited to, when they wanted to offer too many of the small houses in one of the project.
Too vystresovaní
Singapore is a city-state.
Although the new rules could be directed to increase the birth rate of the nation, interview with Singapurci working in the financial district in the heart of the city indicates that they will not have a great effect.
"People are still under stress, the houses are expensive, as well as education, therefore, that many people put off," said a young officer.
"The other whether they have children.
But for me it is important to rely on their own money and time," says another, about twenty years old, young man.
Men and women mention career, stress, and the cost of living, and education as the reasons, which prevent them from having children.
So whether the government is trying to citizens of any force them to have children, they're just finally Singapurci, who have regarding the creation of a family the last word.
What is a private, offline is a private online
Privacy.
According to the dictionary, published by the Royal Spanish academy, this is something that has a personal nature or of "the area of private life, which has every right to protect themselves against any distortion".
What is this privacy for a person under the age of 16 years?
How to apply this definition in their daily lives and on social networks?
Means danger, which is exhibited when on the internet publishes affairs, which could certainly anyone in the normal course of communication did not say?
Journalists from the elPeriódico surveyed the five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years who are frequent internet users.
In four cases considered the concept of privacy as "something quite own" at a personal level and for the "user name and password", if there was a social network.
"Has the biggest secrets, I would not disclosed," says the ten-year Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy on places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, you have accounts for two years.
"They are very secret of secrets, my mom about them can know, but not the whole world," she says.
"On FB I pretty pictures or photos, how to play.
Also you there I had known.
I would not share the photo, that would not have been mine, or a photo that someone would be however it was," he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, pictures of naked people or photographs of the crimes, or write degrading or coarse comments.
Jorge says that he knows all of the 35 friends on FB and my nine fans on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Between them and the mother, who has a name and the password of one of the accounts.
"I started an account on Twitter, so I can express their opinions and to write interesting posts.
I don't know if someone replies, I is there just so I give," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, can I speak with relatives who are far away or to quickly communicate with friends," he says.
Without hesitation say that they would never have accepted a request from an unknown person.
Nor should it didn't care if anyone recommend someone unknown.
The case of the fourteen-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager own accounts on the networks Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask and in the last-mentioned network admits that he did not know 20 people from my friends list.
"I don't fear, because we have something in common, such as music," said.
According to this boy, no one of them on the nic didn't instruct, nor after did not want to address or phone number.
"If at me, pressed or it from me to argue, simply from your account I will remove," he admits.
Jose applied to Ask then, what you have read the recommendations on Twitter.
This boys are not alien to the experience with what is now called cyberbullying (cyberbullying).
"The famous friends on the social network vydírali.
Threatened to kill him and asked for money.
Never nedověděl who it was," confirms.
The victim, according to Jose neodhlásila from the account.
"Just activated the private mode."
Then explains a series of steps, how to account to securely set up.
Unlike Jorge would this boy has posted photos of well known in awkward or embarrassing situations.
"Clearly that I would have done it, if someone hated or should I simply wanted.
Even though I know that it is cyberbullying," she says.
The key issues
Marielos Porrasová, an English teacher and a graduate of the field of Education and teaching, has considered, that to children and adolescents in the social networks of correctly understanding of the situation, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform.
It is reported that: "the Internet was created as a means for finding information, but when it appeared the social network, has changed the rules of the game."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that the academic Marc Prensky, graduate education at the university of Yale, and the author of the article, the Digital natives and digital immigrants, introduce these concepts to this phenomenon explained.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants, who need to learn, and in doing so themselves only we learn," he says.
He explains that it is a complex subject, "because we ask them to rozeznávali, what is appropriate to disseminate, publish, and say, and what does not, at the age, when the are not yet ripe".
Also, to be - what concerns surrounding - sober, at a time when what most eager to be favourite, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences", he adds.
According to this specialist is the most effective way to children and adolescents to show you what it's privacy, asking questions, which is forcing to think.
"Telling them to do something they have not got, doesn't work," he adds.
Further Marrielos Porrasová lists some of the options: there Are things that you unknown person nevyprávěl, so why are you doing this on the internet?
Or: would you, if anyone has posted your picture the way you posted the feel?
You know, what about you other published?
When označuješ of the person in the photos of the celebrations, asked you the following persons for permission?
And one more: the Need to constantly we all know, just what are you doing?
The next point is to realize that they must behave in the internet environment as well as outside of it.
They are the same rules.
"The man is outside of the internet governed by respect, morals, and other principles and the same it should be on social networks," he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a teacher at the first instance and the educational advisor explains that it is essential that the parents of children carefully read the rules of social networking.
"If he understands the intricacies of every, have a good basis to make with the children talked about the consequences of that opening the account on the internet can have.
For example, with regard to the age or what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind the children of the traditional rule of "don't talk to strangers".
The Summit of South America ends and the Declaration of Lima has not been published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of south american nations (Unasur) summit in Peru today ended, without having issued the Declaration of Lima, which has been announced and that was allegedly signed by seven in the presence of the presidents.
The agency Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of heads of states and governments of the organization of the Unasur, but the representatives of the foreign ministry and the presidential office, who at the beginning of the set, that the document be published after the end of the summit, said, that will be later published on the website of the peruvian government.
They further stated that the content was published by peruvian president Ollantou Humala in a few short press releases.
The journalists had all the time of the summit, the limited access to information.
During the negotiations it was in the press room transmitted video of the presidency of the assembly without the sound with the message " confidential meeting, the transmission of sound zamezen".
A small amount of information, which should journalists available, has been provided to the press speakers of some governments, who were present negotiations, but not by peruvian speaker.
The only document published during the negotiations was the list of the participating presidents, which provoked the indignation of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who were asking for more information.
Later sent to the peruvian presidential office media e-mail with the "final declaration" from the summit, but it is just an expression of the president of the Humaly, and not an official document of the summit closed.
Last October was hosted by Peru of the third summit of south American and arab countries (America del Sur-Countries Árabes, ASPA), and even on this occasion was not originally promised Declaration of Lima published, even though it was the press eagerly required.
The official website of the ASPA can find out, that the document was published last Tuesday.
On both international meetings to seek the peruvian authorities to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but to completely prevent the flow of information.
The Summit ended, inter alia, the common commitment of Chile and Peru to the adoption of the judgment of the hague Court of justice, which solves the border dispute between the two countries.
The president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and the president of Chile Sebastian Piñera gathered during the regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International court of justice in the Hague, which on Monday will begin listening to a defense plea speech of both parties to discuss the dispute launched by the Lima against Santiago.
"We yield and do judgment, which will resolve the dispute, which is today at this international court we are discussing," said the president of the Humala, together with his chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, of the convention and the international courts," added Piñera and greeted the president of the Humalu by pressing the hand with the flags of the two countries.
Confirmation of the two presidents, that is subjected to the decision of the International court of justice, was published then, what Colombia this week, the Bogotský pact, thereby expressed comply with the rulings of the international court, which ruled on the maritime border with Nicaragua, and Colombia this decision was deemed completely wrong.
The Summit took place without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chavez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchnerová).
Paraguay was excluded from the organization of the Unasur in 2011, after the appeal of the then president Fernando Luga and the meeting did not participate.
The host president Ollanta Humala was commissioned by the start of the morning speeches and ending summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read out the final document, in which has informed, that has been adopted 16 agreements and planned activities of the 31 projects between the south american countries, with investments in the amount of 17 billion dollars.
In addition to the adopted agreements mentioned, that the member countries of the organization of UNASUR "shall take important steps towards the objectives in the form of the south american citizenship, because of which are extended to the agreement on the stay".
Informed that are supported by actions to improve the "cooperation in the fight against civil uncertainty and international organised crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap internet in all corners of South America and for common and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters".
When Europe is in a crisis, "does not have the economic consolidation (Latin America) winning the essence, but rather should serve to expand our productivity and show our peoples a better future," he added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects which will improve the transport connections of the different places of South America, especially in rural and border areas...to our country have been better linked and establish new economic ties," he said in čteném expression peruvian president.
He mentioned that five of these projects concerns Peru and transverse axes of its territory from the coast up to Brazil, and the other two are related to a better connection with Ecuador, the more detail, however, did not elaborate.
The final document also touched upon the political situation in Paraguay.

Rafael Correa: South America must learn from the integration of Europe
Ekvádorský president Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal, in which the "South America, in this case, you really must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the South american union of nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television TV Perú that the Europeans "to kill for the 2nd world war" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one of the homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project for the creation of the south american citizenship, which the member countries of the organization of Unasur support.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in the framework of any south american country, which is already underway between the members of the Andean community, however, there are still backward areas that they want us to go back to the past," pointed out.
Ekvádorský the president, inter alia, expressed its agreement with by the Organization of american states (OAS) under the condition that it reduced the influence of the anglo-saxon states, and taking into account those, who signed the Pact of San Jose on human rights.
"Those who are in the lead, is never useless, not to, and we Jihoameričané on the contrary, everything will sign.
It is inconceivable that the inter-american commission on human rights is in Washington funded by the United states," he said in allusion to the political asylum granted Ecuador founder of WikiLeaks Julianu Assangeovi.
President Correa has confirmed that this decision does not regret, because it betrayed its principles, and to respect their "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at that time, "there was a reasonable suspicion that he would Assange could be extradited to a third country without regard to the ongoing process".
In addition, criticized the Swedish justice, which he requested that the Swedish territory subjected to interrogation because of the alleged sexual offence, while the "custom Swedish legislation enables us to hold the hearing videokonferenčním call, which could take place of the ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said that there is a risk that the Assangeho occurs to the deterioration of physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken with him since what is on our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has a small lung trouble, but nothing serious," said the ecuadorian head of state.
"The threatened but that his physical and psychological condition gets worse, because it is locked up in a small space without the possibility of movement in the fresh air.
It would influenced the health of everyone," he said.
President Correa noted that the solution of asylum granted Assangeovi from June to quito embassy in London on the basis of a permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the european courts, and stressed that with the London were interviewed for the purpose of resolving the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We respect human rights nevyjednáváme, such a word in this case we don't use, but constantly conducted interviews.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the european courts, because Assangeův lawyer Baltazar Garzón leads a series of proceedings in the various european instances," he mentioned.
He stated that "if the United Kingdom shall issue tomorrow culvert, everything comes to an end".
And if Sweden mr Assangeho hears the quito embassy in London or via Skype, as it no problem allows its legislation and, as has been done in other cases, it will be tomorrow this problem brings to an end."
Correa took advantage of this situation to be presented as a defender of the freedom of the press, and explain that definitely does not tolerate "podprůměrnost, bad intentions and the lie that undermine freedom of expression".
The biggest enemies of a free press, not us, very crooked and evil politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, nátlaků and blackmail," he said.
From this point of view expressed joy over the fact that neither the takovíto journalists, "not bankers, nor the hegemonic countries and even the bourgeoisie are not proficient in Ecuador", and indicated that, if re-elected, "will continue in the changes led to the right path and in the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to continue the veto of Paraguay expressed regarding the membership in the union Unasur at least until its next elections, and argued that the whole "it must be hard and not to tolerate the opportunism and pučismus wrapped up in legality", because, in fact, "destroyed the legitimacy of the paraguayan democracy".
Ekvádorský president in addition, he stated that he considers that "quite suitable" the wish of his colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime border between the two countries now, in the time after the judgment of the International court in the Hague, which ruled in favor of Nicaragua.
At the moment is not the case accepted.
"It is a problem between south american and středoamerickou countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but it must be overcome by the will to follow along.
It is to be assessed at large, to have been overcome and it was the opportunity to go forward."
He also expressed hope in settlement of the dispute over the maritime border, which addresses in the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is for Latin America the right to search international instance, if both countries undertake to make a judgment, whether it be any hard".
In connection with the possibility that he will stand as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador, to be applied in the order already on the third term, he noted that perceives this option "with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa declared that if in February 2013 loses the elections, he would be retiring from public life.
"I personally never was not interested in power, but so unfair situations, such as the socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, can remedy the only political power.
My political movement, it was believed, that it is I, who guarantees that the likely victory, so this responsibility, we must take," he said.
"If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I would from the policies of the left.
If we lose, waiting for me to do the same.
I had already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of the venezuelan president Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
"I have just talked with venezuelan vice president Nicolásem Madurem, which says that president Chavez went on a planned routine treatment, and on his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
This is not a relapse in the health status of the president," he explained.
The head of the ecuadorian state has today attended the sixth summit of the heads of state and government of the Union of south american nations (Unasur), which was concluded with calls for greater regional integration in order to sustain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabriziovi was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the result of his test: HIV-positive.
"It was as if to hit me a flash of lightning," tells in the memories of the moment of truth, whom the doctor tried to "a little bit of ease", but apparently without success.
Boy it before the family enthusiasts held.
He decided to take his illness itself on their shoulders, and started on her informed. And with such commitment that has already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
This is no doubt one of the nejdávnějších patients Units of HIV in the Civil hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in the year 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 years, which was something unimaginable in the early ' 90s, when there was a lot of doubt, a few treatment options and greater stigma.
Then, with him, nor the director of the clinic of the Mexican institute of social security (IMSS) nerozloučil, "because he had a cutting blow".
Then have AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible with this syndrome survive and to live.
However, it is a lot of persons that their illness does not know and come up when the virus has caused the destruction of the organism and vysílil the immune system, and are becoming then the victims of random infections.
31 years from the time, what in the world discovered the disease AIDS, or at least since the first documented cases, "it is a big success, that the length of life of the patient, which in a timely manner and in an appropriate way starts with the treatment, it is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit in the Civilian hospital in Guadalajara with the fact that this information has been confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Infektolog and a specialist on HIV/AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have come to conclusion, that since 2008 AIDS is not a judgment of death, but that the length of survival and full of life depends on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients, which is a disease is diagnosed, while the better are those who are taking drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that anyone who is HIV diagnosed in 25 years, according to these findings "in compliance with treatment to live without any problems up to 75 years", he explained in an interview with the doctor.
To underline the importance of this progress, it is appropriate to recall that the average length of life of Mexicans is now 76 years old.
Although the mortality rate in recent years has significantly decreased, and in the case of Mexico dropped the number of people who have died of AIDS, from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in the year 2011 (the yearbook of the Joint united nations programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), it is also true that from the discovery of AIDS deaths, according to the national statistics, 60 percent of patients.
Only in the state of Jalisco have died in 2011 255 persons and in may of this year, so far 187. However, from the year 2005 is to ensure universal access to antiretrovirotikům.
- Why continue to people on the consequences of the disease die?
- "It seems to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.
This way I see it, this is how it happens with us in the hospital.
At least for the last 12 years we have not used the stock of medicines. The problem is that the patients come in a very advanced stage, because they do not know the status of the disease, which in the late stage of the disease."
Adds a compelling indication: "Nine out of ten patients comes, when it is manifest any associated infection. The only thing you need to do, so that we can more impact on the overall mortality, the disease before diagnosis, and therefore it should be a large-scale offer tests to detect the disease to all persons who request them".
In its proposal coincides with specialists and officials from the State council for the prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco, as well as directly with patients as Fabrizio, who came to let it do the tests to a private lab just because they did it its mate, and despite his young age he had already erupted disease AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer, which is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes, when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that umřou, and do not want anything more to know.
"If I have to die, you'd better be three times a week vyřádím," they say, but it is not my case.
The change was for the better, healthy him, I work out, I take drugs."
To this day his parents knows only that it was suffering from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I like to travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I give attention to yourself and to the other person," lists Fabrizio, who accepted the challenge in order to share their experiences with the daily newspaper MILENIO JALISCO, that today in the framework of the World AIDS day to encourage them to their testimony to those who have fear.
"Either you allow them to do the tests. If risked, so let them know as soon as possible, if they are HIV positive, it is better. And if you already have been diagnosed, whether they realize that they can live like anyone else, when they will be held accountable."
This message summarises the password of the battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Among the programs for health and ordinary citizens is a big gap, said Ricardo Salazar, guadalajarský journalist who finds the information about the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places, which is engaged in this task "is actually increase the distribution of condoms, first gave us one or two, today give us the packages, and the sta of condoms, which is very well, but there are still people who do not have to kondomům approach", he said.
Between nejnáchylnějšími to the new infections are pubescent.
"What do you want it?" is a common question full of irony and assessment from social workers, school counselors, staff pharmacies and medical personnel, that teens want to avoid, says the reporter.
Suggested this ineffective distribution of the change. Whether condoms are not just for the counters, but those hundred whether located in the dávkovačích on public záchodcích, in places where often go young.
"This is not the promotion of promiscuity.
Nor it is not about them "pay beer and motel", as reacted governor Emilio González to the question whether he agrees with the distribution of the sheath contraceptives in their district.
Takovásexualita is not. The best is to make condoms to those who have sexual lives they lead," he noted.
The key numbers in the state of Jalisco
It was recorded 13 435 cases (12 158 cases of AIDS and 1 317 cases of HIV).
This state of affairs means in Mexico fourth place in the new and identified cases of AIDS and 13th place in the context of HIV.
92% of infections take place sexual way, 6% of the blood the way y 2% perinatálně.
It is estimated that with the HIV virus can live for about 50 thousand people, since, on the one registered case is four to five people that do not know about the disease.
Judgment approved by the court of appeal of the United states, which does not recognize the debt restructuring of the company Grupo Vitro provided for bankruptcy in Mexico, raises the ominous precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
Thus, it appears that the processes of the restructuring of companies, which allow the mexican laws in the country of stripes and stars in defiance of international agreements do not apply.
The approval of the judgment of 15 June last year by the judge Harlinem Hal with the bankruptcy court for the northern Texas leaves in the practice of mexican companies without defense against the possibility of confiscation of their property on the other side of the river el Bravo.
However, the judgment opens the main mexican manufacturers of glass doors to the Supreme court of the United states with an appeal against the three irregularities.
At the outset, it should be said that while the judge of this initial claims, the creditors shall manage the insolvency law of the United states, the court of appeal of the Fifth district is based in New Orleans says that the main procedure sets out the bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, it should point to the ignorance of the international process of cooperation in insolvency cases of multinational enterprises.
In essence, was created for this purpose the model law of the United nations for the unification of international trade law, which determines the arbiter of the organization of the American Law Institute.
Second, the judgment provides that, without a vote of the branches of the internal corporate structure, which is recognized by the debt of the parent company Vitro against subsidiaries, would not have been reached by the majority required for approval of the restructuring.
However, this option mexican laws admitted.
The fact is, that the case of the company Vitro was not the first, which was adopted this scheme.
There is a half-dozen of examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose internal debts vouched Federal bankruptcy institute.
In addition, it is true that even after the deduction of the votes of the branches of the creditors - who against the company Vitro stood by the court in the United states, i.e. the funds "vultures", such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - have not reached majority.
In a vote would have reached about 45 percent to 37.
This figure the court of appeal does not take into account.
From another point of view blames the court company Vitro out of a difficult situation, which has faced since 2008 - on the background of the serious economic crisis that hit the United states.
Meanwhile, the family-owned company González Sets lodges an appeal for a new consideration by the court of appeal, to the examination was carried out with the full participation of, and thus for the participation of the five judges, because originally voted only three.
If he fails here, it will require as a remedy, the revision process of the higher instances, in this case, the Supreme court of the United states.
The case is serious, that the court failed to document sent by the mexican government as a department of the amicus curiae, in which is described in detail the procedure for the company Vitro in the framework of the Bankruptcy law and in which he points out that the company you eased by the fact that the move to the agreements signed by the two countries, that confronted the act with the provisions of chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy code of the United states.
Navícse points out that the country complies with the principles of the Commission of the United nations for international trade, that is, to comply with the rules defined for international cases of insolvency, which guarantee equality for borrowers and lenders.
Shock on both sides: the chastisement of the company Vitro and the state.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: " Basketball was my life"
Basketball globetrotter Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was with this sálovým sport linked more than 60 years and has travelled through him the whole world.
Few people in puerto rico has such a variety of memories in the history of the local basketball, as has Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was before him in 2008 caught stroke on the wheel chair, fired into the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player under the age categories, the player of the national basketball league BSN, the owner and the coach of the team Vaqueros de Bayamón in the national basketball league, or the president of the puerto rican basketball federation.
"I held in the course of your life in basketball a lot of roles, including several at the same time, as if I was in the 90s of the president of the national league BSN, the general manager of the national team and the president of the federation," he recalled Reyes during the visit to the reporters of the newspaper Primera Hora at home in Bayamónu, where he lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
"Basketball has been my life."
Reyes in his assertion does not exaggerate.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenir items from his long career, is a witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart of the
With the greatest emotion of all the guards ones that remind us of its activity in the los Vaqueros from the middle of 50th years, where he was a player until 1982, when at the same time, celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or the owner of the team.
"It was my best summer, that I most enjoyed, because I had the opportunity with a team of los Vaqueros from 1967 to participate in the eight championship, whether as owner, co-owner, or a coach.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held in the years from 1971 to 1975.
And then I have one championship bid farewell - in 1981, when the BSN debuted Jerome Mincy.
When the team took over the "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," said Reyes.
"I remember that Gene Bartow, who has previously coached and at that time he worked at the university of Alabama at Birmingham, said to me: "I have for you handsome dvoumetrového players.
Do you want him?"
And it was the beginning of the Mincyho, one of the best players that ever puerto Rico should.
Bartow me then recommended a point guard Raymond Gausseho, which became a member of the team and one of our best striker of the championship.
I recall, that said, that if Mincy will bring Bayamonu victory in the championship, Gauss then will contribute to the further."
Championship, when for the team to los Vaqueros played Gauss, enjoyed, but only at a distance, because in 1988 already, he served as the president of the basketball federation.
At that time wanted to dedicate its functions and enjoy the Mincyho location in the national team.
"I remember how we first defeated the United states in the qualifying olympic wrestling in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the world cup in 1990, where we ended the quarter, but we had to have a bronze were it not for the canadian referee, who left us a repeat of the final face-off," said Reyes.
Is a team of the world cup in 1990, the best national team, which you've ever seen?
It is among the best, as well as the one that beat the Dream Team at the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was the national team in the Panamerických games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and vypráskali we are a team of the United states, which was very similar to that of us vyfouklo bronze at the world championships.
This team should not only Mincyho, Gausseho, Ramona Rivase, Fica López and "Piculína" (Ortiz), but also there were youths (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter, brothers Leónové (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who couldn't be in the team in 1990 due to the injury of the knee.
The team, which may not perfect composition, but managed to us to win the gold medal and bring great joy, was a team from the olympic qualification in 1995 in the argentine Neuquénu.
With the players on the roster, as were the "Canito" Nieves, Pablo alicea on and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced the player excluded because of a skirmish in Panamerických games in Mar de Plata, we, despite all the predictions have won the gold.
What was the best player of the puerto rico?
It was without any doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers of international tournaments are impressive.
No one from puerto rico reached at this level such results as Piculín.
Not to mention its effect in different leagues, where he played.
Who was the best portorickým a coach?
It is very hard.
We had a very good generation to which they belong Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
From the young to me very much like the work of Leo Arilla.
That your success in the federation is the biggest?
That I was a part of the most famous era national football team in the years 1988 to 1995 and at the beginning of the 90s of the national league BSN in one season to 17 teams.
What you failed to prove?
Were the things that I wanted to introduce, as a division of youth categories according to the regions.
For example, that the guys from Ponce played only in their field and vied with teams from other parts of the island only in the national play-off.
Now children travel a lot and play too matches, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefits in the mandatory certificates, and courses for coaches, assistants of the judges and referees.
It makes me happy.
What now are you?
The most I listen to music, I look at the YouTube video with the music of my time, I enjoy grandchildren, and sometimes I go to the basketball matches.
And, of course, I am enjoying the company of his wife Isabel, who was always by my side.

Charmé, however, did not have a clue what he was in a few more months of waiting: the Disastrous hurricane Sandy, the budget gap, which some have called a "debt Armageddon", and the growing conflict, into which it is drawn Israel, the place where, according to the christians teoretizujících about the end of the world will begin the Apocalypse.
"I did not realize that this is going to be nejapokalyptičtější semester, what ever was," said Charmé this week students Rutgersovy University in Camden, New Jersey.
When one analyzes what is happening today in the world, as if we had 30 days, is it really a good time.
And remember that the wrong means for the apocalyptic-minded good.
And this is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" in this semester, which in theory is the last in the history.
At the University Temple organized by the assistant professor Barry Vacker rate "Means, culture and the end of the world".
Each week students are exploring an apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombie, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We argue, why these ideas with time expanding," he says, and how to offer the hypothetical scenarios, which manages some of the human behavior.
For example, if the nuclear material will get into the hands of terrorists, can break out of the war.
This month analyse the students movies with apokalyptickými themes and examine how they differ from the examples from real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, probable, believable and impossible," says Vacker.
In the main campus of the State university in Pennsylvania to put together a professor of Latin american history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solariová, assistant professor of art history and anthropology, to hold the course with a simple name, the End of the world.
"Nepřipojujeme "2012", because they always count with a possibility to arrange course again in the case that the world will not end," said Restall.
Despite the "impending doom" the students must study, to create projects and do the final exam.
At Penn State will be the final exam held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not give students the other option than to work "up right into the evening anticipated the end of the world", said Restall.
Courses have become very popular.
"Stretched out within two hours," said Restall of its course for students with a high average, which have signed up to 35.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we have been receiving e-mail questions, whether there is still a place.
Themselves students assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It seems to me a fascinating to see what people are doing to yourself utěšili," she said on the Rutgersově university in Camden 23letá Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and the sociology of Haddonfieldu in New Jersey.
And therefore, apocalyptic, secular or religious sentiment is only a matter of comfort or its absence.
Will Wekesa, 25letý a student of psychology and nursing, said that he saw all the apocalyptic movies.
"Never before heard of the hour at which it could teach," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no shriven student, let alone professor, said that he believes in the date of the end of the 21st of December.
"Our first project was about the mayan predictions and in some way it vyvracíme," said Julie Zeglenová, 21letá a student of the last year at the University of Temple of West Chester.
"The mayans never nepředpověděli the end of the world; it is just the key point in the calendar," said Restall.
But he added that in western culture, there is an apocalyptic anxiety that goes back centuries, that people respond to changes in their surroundings predictions about the end of the world.
The heyday of the speculation caused the internet.
"Else for that people didn't think," he said.
This is done in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religion at the University of La Salle, which this year lectures in the Philippines, the question of whether there knows of a course about the "end of the world", he replied quickly.
"The philippines is the end of the world to participate," he wrote, and suggested an exception at the highest office.
We have the mercy of the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there were many days of the last judgment, and he said that if nothing is going to happen on December 21, "people immediately begin to think about the next date" or philosophize, that the 21st of December is the beginning of a seven-year period, at the end of which the lapse of the world.
The date shall be taken lightly students and professors.
Several have said that they intend to go on the celebration of "the end of the world".
"I'll call a few friends, we laughed together," explained the twenty-year-old student of communication Samira Ford.
