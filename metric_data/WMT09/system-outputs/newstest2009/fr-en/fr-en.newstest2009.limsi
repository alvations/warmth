At the end of trade, the stock market into negative territory bascula Prague 
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange réctifia its losses. 
Transactions with the actions?EZ reached almost half the usual daily exchanges. 
On Tuesday, right from the start of trading, the stock exchange of Prague renoua with its fall to the eve, when it lost nearly six percent. 
This time, the reduction is due to the fall of the action on Wall Street. 
The reaction of the market in the face of the outcome of the vote in the US House of Representatives, who refused to adopt the stabilization of the financial sector and perceptible American, is also at home. 
Fall of actions in Asia 
Asian stock markets lived on Tuesday in a dramatic fall, even though the indices succeeded, in the course of the day, erasing some losses. 
The Hang Seng index of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong lost four percent during the exchanges, but later, he effaça some losses and reduced the drop to almost 2.5%. 
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index of Chinese shares following the movement of the stock exchange of Hong Kong lost 3.8%, the markets are closed in Shanghai. 
The actions of the Sydney stock lost more than five percent, but finally we managed to reduce the losses at 4.3%. 
According to its Index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6%. 
"The hesitation about action to rescue the US will certainly affect the financial markets around the world," observed Joseph Yam, the head of the Monetary Affairs of Hong Kong. 
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, regardless of the Chinese central bank. 
Interest rates have to Hong Kong the same level as the United States. 
According to the Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly resume the negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system. 
Otherwise, we risk that other countries are suffering the consequences. 
The bloodbath in America's actions 
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the draft supports the financial system, in which she would have had to spend up to 700 billion dollars (nearly 12 bilions to stop splitting). 
Renièrent legislators and the call for support of the project of President George Bush. 
According to Bush, the project is expected to resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilize the economy as a whole. 
American actions lived, on Monday, a blood bath and the main indices of actions experienced the biggest drop of the past 20 years. 
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, following a fall on such a scale for the last time in 1987. 
The index lost already during the vote, but when it seemed that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall. 
Congress gave: the government of the United States can invest 700 billion dollars in banks 
The leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a form of the agreement of financial assistance to the US financial system. 
It will be put to the vote early next week. 
American legislators effectuèrent a turning point in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance amounting to $700 billion (around 12 billion kronor), given to America's financial system. 
The success is not yet safe. 
Indeed, before they can publish the final version of the law and submit it to the vote, the Congressmans must finish a number of details of the agreement. 
The plan to support the financial system will be examined Monday in the House of Representatives. 
Said Sunday to Reuters news agency, Barney Frank, the chairman of the committee on banking and financial legislation from the House. 
According to the sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should theoretically be put to the vote in the Senate. 
According to economists, the announcement of the fact that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a first major psychological factor trying to revive the financial markets. 
However, given the complexity of the mechanism by which assistance to markets can be effective, will follow a "disappointment." 
Paulson: the plan must be efficient 
"We have made great progress." 
We have resolved our views on the form that should have the package of measures to stabilize the market, "erosion in the Bloomberg the Democrat Nancy Pelosi." 
She said that the final vote could be taken by Sunday. 
In the night from Saturday to Sunday, representatives of legislators rencontrèrent the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, in order to give the government a final form. 
It should buy, among finance companies, sold real estate assets in financial enterprises which cause huge losses and threaten the stability of the entire system. 
"We are about to find an agreement on a plan that will work and which should be, too, effective on the market." 
We must still go ahead with this plan of restoration of the markets, but I think we have, "said Paulson." 
A signal to Asian exchanges 
The global financial crisis has a great impact on the markets of actions that fall. 
According évadiez Democrat Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are so that Congress could reach a final agreement by Sunday. 
They want and calm investors before the start of trade on the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first hour zone, where the decision of Congress could influence the exchange on Monday. 
For now, however, it is impossible to say with certainty when the two Houses of Congress comes out to vote, or whether the negotiations will not remain blocked at the last moment, for this or that problem. 
Legislators expect it will be adopted in the days to come. 
Nevertheless, the law will still be many changes. 
The total amount devoted to the aid of the system must be split into two parts. 
The first 350 billion dollars, as was the wish of President George Bush, should be available as soon as possible. 
But if Congress will have the impression that the programme does not fulfil its function, he has the ability to block the granting of the remaining amount, following two stages: firstly an extra USD 100 billion, and then, finally, 350 billion dollars. 
Mr. Bush salua the progress in the negotiations 
Although the president is able to use its veto to this decision, Congress has the opportunity to put it down. 
Despite these changes, the main thrust of the programme, which was to obtain finance for the purchase of the poor real estate securities, whose value chuta, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained. 
"All the work is done." 
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed on Sunday to vote for the law, and the Senate on Monday, "Republican Senator Judd Gregg made it." 
US President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations. 
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy." 
Limiting the parachutes sector 
The chairman of the Senate banking committee Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said that the legislators have agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of contributing to the losses, the agreement rebates, the progress of the plan on the axis of the time. 
The new law also sets to limit those parachutes sector for the directors of companies participating in the programme and it establishes a committee, which will ensure the monitoring of the funds. 
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance. 
"We have worked very hard on the issue and have made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson. 
The plan also includes aid for homeowners, who have problems to pay. 
The government should negotiate new advance payments in the case of mortgages that it will buy back, while reducing the instalments of debtors and enabling the latter to keep their homes. 
Marek psychological assistance. 
According to the chief economist David Marek of Patria Finance, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation is going to be very difficult. 
"And this is due to the fact that we do not know what the mechanism and the price of the purchase of assets to problems." 
This point will be crucial to decide on the distribution of losses in the financial sector and the government, "said Marek, this week in the server." iHNed cz. " 
If the plan is adopted now, or early next week, is, according to Marek, not really all that serious. 
"It is much more important that the congressmans agree, as early as this week, that they support this plan and that they will devote as soon as possible." 
The psychological importance of the agreement, which provided for the adoption of the plan, the most important thing at the moment, "emphasized Marek." 
A fight taken to extremes: MP3 players against the mobile. 
We advise you, how to choose 
While virtually all mobile can read MP3 files in the MP3 player knows, no telephone. 
It seems to be clear that it is better to buy only a telephone. 
Nonetheless, there are plenty of reasons to get a reader independent. 
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the demands of the future owner. 
It would be absurd to buy the house a gramophone expensive high-end to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
On the one hand, such musical products do not leave on vinyle disk, and, in terms of quality, there is no objective reason for that to happen. 
Well, if there vinyles discs in your shelves crowded, with the art rock, jazz or the blues, you rêvez at least probably for such a gramophone. 
The same goes for music during travel, namely music high-pressure, to put it in a simplified - music in MP3. 
Here too, there are groups on the basis of price and quality. 
For one, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand kronor for a reader, in the same way as a fan of Pink Floyd would be difficult to sustain the headphones bought for 20 kronor to the market. 
These are two extremes, among whom there is enough room for everyone. 
The choice is wide. 
Battery life is also decisive 
Some readers of high-end music are capable of much more than a simple reading of music, but it is unknown functions, of course, most of the mobile. 
No current apparatus is so universal that the telephone. 
In addition to the primary functions, telephone calls and the sending of SMS, it is able to read music and films, register them, it has a camera variable quality and can, for example, to be used for navigation. 
And if one takes into account the Smartphones and communicateurs, you will have in your pocket a small computer. 
Since no frigidaire knows burn meat and no television will take photographs, we see almost a miracle. 
Well, the universal nature of the mobile is not without drawbacks. 
The number of functions that you use it, the more the interval between two rechargements will be reduced. 
And the reading of music is one of the most important energy goinfres. 
Are few mobile phones which are able to read music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, the figure is much smaller. 
In this respect, the readers of music (especially the most rudimentary) are much more powerful. 
In the case of cheap mobile, they will play music for a few hours. 
If, moreover, they would just call from time to time, including tax you, to be sure, a second recharge for the work - this is true even for the more expensive. 
Their problem is not one that will arise for MP3 players, which are capable, in the wake of a reloading, a continuing operation of at least 9 hours, including the worst performing countries. 
Another problem occurs when the recording of music in the mobile. 
Unfortunately, a limited proportion of appliances has a universal connecteur USB, especially since not all cannot be directly connected to the computer, without special software. 
There is, of course, make music directly on the map memory, but few card readers know this be done without reduction, given the tiny size of the cards memory used in mobile. 
With regard to the readers, do you need, except (iPod), no software. 
It is enough to fill, through the USB, a device connecteur music from the computer. 
Most of the mobile and readers will create their own media library was closed after the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the style, or maybe in after the judgment of the user. 
There is some aircraft that an index with a structure of tree, in the manner of the Explorer from Windows, others are capable of two (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon with intelligent phones operating system). 
The readers are easier to manipulate, the mobile have more know-how 
In the choice of concrete, get you above all to the lifespan of the accumulateur, to the ability of memory, the quality and the type of overflowed its and, of course, to the easy option of the contract. 
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if today you will listen to that for a limited period of time, for example by taking the tram, you only have any motive, reading the MP3. 
Almost all mobile phones are now capable of. 
You are not even obliged to too much attention to the formats of music that the motive or the reader is able to read. 
All come to read the MP3 and the vast majority of music that will come up to you will be precisely this format. 
It is one of the most widespread sizes and apart from him, the vast majority of equipment is to read also of music in WMA format. 
The ACC (format used by the firm Apple and its iPods), meanwhile, is less often. 
High-end mobile phones also allow, for example, the purchase of online music. 
You only need to visit for mobile telephony, web pages of the operator (or those of another supplier) and buy the song or album in question. 
This service alone should be a convincing reason to get a mobile, musical. 
The offer of operators is, unfortunately, wretched and it is limited in most cases, the radio tubes fast facts. 
Prices are also not lower. 
Nevertheless, it is generally believed that the way to buy music (be it by phone, Internet, or by wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future. 
Most people are still their mobiles on itself. 
Whenever you want to listen to something, you just have to get out the motive in your pocket, when you have forgotten your MP3 player in the home. 
However, it is also important if you are always on you the headphones or a handsfree with connection. 
If this is not the case, you can use the integrated forums that have virtually all the mobile, but a minimum of readers MP3. 
For many, the main advantage of the mobile music is their price. 
The cheapest cost normally less than three thousand. 
For a price of three four thousand kronor, we can have a walkman already very proper. 
Well, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of exit for ordinary headphones. 
The price of the best telephones and better equipped, also an entry for ordinary headphones, is no more than 15 000. 
The readers, however, have the advantage of having a command easy. 
Really anyone comes to ensure the most rudimentary command readers - who do not necessarily correspond to the cheaper (cf. our choice). 
A minimum of functions; and the similarities of the command post with that of a cassette, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious. 
There is no risk of a collision in the form of an Internet mobile phone by chance, followed by a bill of transmitting data is immense. 
What appliance choose 
Even the mobile the cheapest (e.g. the Vodafone 527) have generally a slot for memory cards exchangeable (the type M2, microSD, and so on). 
Even with the additional purchase of such a card, you are not going to exceed two thousand kronor. 
But be careful. 
The basic models will support in principle that the cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. 
Only the most expensive fare even with 8 GB of memory cards. 
If you have already a mobile and still want to buy an MP3 player cheap, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, Samsung, a Emgeton, or a iriver. 
Depending on the capacity (max.) (2 GB), you must not spend more than 1 100 kronor. 
If you are one of the auditors more demanding, choose instead of specialized mobile - walkman (Sony Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung). 
These appliances are equipped with independent command keyboard for MP3, and that is how the ease of the order is moving closer to that of an MP3 player independent. 
Sony Ericsson, whose mobile of the series walkman have the same menu user that readers MP3 sold separately, is the one who has gone furthest in this area. 
The same service, in the same category of price, but with a capacity of memory (up to 16 GB) and a lifespan of the accumulateur (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours) superior, is assured by an MP3 player produced by one of the trademarks. 
A first virtual operator will gain the Czech Republic this year. 
Perhaps 
The market is relatively advanced mobile in the Czech Republic, our operators proposing practically the same services as their partners in western Europe. 
Despite this, there is surely something - a virtual operator, which would force the traditional operators to lower prices. 
It may be that it will not for a long time. 
We have already mentioned, repeatedly, on Mobil. cz the fact that the Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe. 
The?TÚ (the Czech Office of Telecommunications), who indicated that the price of a text message was higher among us than in the rest of the European Union, has stressed. 
So, following the last steps of the European Commission in the area of the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to happen - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers for mobile operators Czech cheaper than at home. 
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, compared with Europe? 
The simple answer is, there is a lack of competition that would really go into the fight. 
This may seem paradoxical, since we have just three networks and a mobile penetration that greatly exceeds the 100%. 
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely concurrenciez. 
In this, Pavel Dvo?ák, President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (?TÚ), who has repeatedly said that in the Czech Republic there was more room for another operator, is crowd with operators. 
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network has apparently very lucky (on the other hand, now, it would be hard to frequency). 
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator. 
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators in the mobile market which has caused a serious decline in prices, which were subsequently respond also the traditional operators. 
However, even before the entry of the spoilsport, such as Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those that we mean home to effect in Britain. 
However, it appeared that there was room for such operators and they could have a real success. 
We are not obliged to look too far to find examples of this. 
In February, we informed you of the launch, in Poland, the virtual operator Mobilking. 
In just six months, the operator has managed to win more than 100 000 customers and become the fifth operator in the country. 
Add that behind the Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which owns, among other things, the U: fon in Tchèquie. 
The advantage of virtual operators are able to focus on a target group much more concrete. 
For their operation to be effective, indeed they need far fewer customers than a classic operator. 
They are, in fact, devoid of the costs of construction, operation and maintains mobile network, relatively high. 
This is how in the world, the virtual operators are emerging as operators at low cost, they suggest some cheap calls and text messages, which is often balanced by an offer limited services. 
Tesco Mobile proposes, for example in Britain, text messages at least twice cheaper than its competitors. 
However, as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland, focusing on a target group unusual can also be a good whack advertising. 
In fact, this operator aims specifically men. 
"Real men choose Mobilking - an operator who they want and to which they can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, exploiting this virtual operator. 
It is difficult to say if such a concept could walk also at home. 
Miroslav?epický, the spokesman for Vodafone, in doubt: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentaire approach, which is based most of virtual operators." 
Especially as it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services. " 
In the Czech Republic, no chance, mobile operators say 
It nevertheless seems almost sure that if there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, this will not be Mobilking. 
"We are discussing the expansion of this project to success, but in the Czech Republic negotiations are not very promoters." 
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries of our region, "said in a telephone maintains for Mobil." Studni?ková Jana cz, spokesman of the financial group Penta. " 
It has thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case not favourable to the idea. 
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything possible in order that a potential competitor to appear. 
The group GTS Novera, which would thus go one step further in order to become a real competitor in the field of Telefonika enterprise customers, do not hide for long enough, his intention to launch a virtual mobile operator. 
"We want very much to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile." 
And the sooner the better. 
We have already held talks about this possibility repeatedly with the entire Czech mobile operators. 
With some, we have managed to make progress in the negotiations, "said the spokesman of the Group of Pavel Kaidl." 
The future is therefore perhaps promising. 
According to unofficial, it seems that perhaps we could receive the first virtual operator already by the end of the year. 
But for now, its creation is accompanied by a complete silence. 
"At this moment, we do not believe that there is a place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such." 
The Czech market in comparison with other very specific. 
For the moment, no issue with a serious and complex project in this field has contacted, "said Vlastimil Sr?e? press department of the Telefonika O2, in its statement for Mobil." 'cz. " 
Other operators will also refer to the nature of the Czech market. 
The spokesman of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not achieved for the moment of viable project advantageous and bilaterally, which could serve as a basis." 
And going on to add: "It is virtually impossible that surfaced in a virtual operator T-Mobile network by the end of the year." 
To operate in such a short space of time limited, we should have now a concrete agreement. " 
Vodafone runs rather his attention to the fulfilment of the demands for its own 3G licence. 
Miroslav?epický said in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the field of infrastructure costs and shared." 
This is what, in our view, means the more contributions from the point of view of customers. 
Vodafone chief strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to set up a common network for a mobile Internet. " 
The authorities responsible: in line with the operators 
The approach of the mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a fall in prices and therefore to a reduction in their benefits. 
Why, then, to facilitate the advent of such a competitor? 
When it comes to their interests, the operators know as larrons Germany. the niggling legal distinctions accompanying the creation of the U: fon also bears witness. 
The greatest pressure apparent on the?TÚ during the creation of the U: fon, was that exerted by T-Mobile society. 
Witness information accessible to the public learned from?TÚ websites. 
Well, today, the U: fon lends itself serve as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator. 
Martina Kemrová has observed on this subject, "competition in the mobile market was, moreover, recently magnified by the entry on the market for a fourth mobile operator." 
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player make, and above all its services, in standards. " 
But given the attitude of the mobile operators, the indifference of Czech regulators is disconcerting. 
However, it is not only the attitude of the?TÚ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, has unfortunately not, in the Czech Republic, the power to intervene in economic competition. 
This one falls exclusively to the Office for the Protection of economic competition (ÚOHS). 
However, he embraced, faced with this problem, his position is typical. 
"The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a virtual operator and mobile operator in question about renting the necessary infrastructure." 
No such agreement has been concluded for the moment, because the supply of potential nominees originally had not presented sufficient interest in the traditional operators, "said in response to our question Kristián Chalupa of external relations department of the ÚOHS." 
A statement issued and do not would surprise from representatives of operators. 
But from an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and also takes care, among other things, that no one is taking advantage of its position on the market, such a statement is very confusing. 
Especially as Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where the virtual operators are normally present, we can see that their entry on the market has contributed to a fall in the prices of mobile telephone services." 
However, in the sense of an honest functioning market and a lowering of prices does not seem to be part of the interests of the ÚOHS. 
What is shocking is harmony, almost touching the three mobile operators, which is their reactions. 
The question, whether it is really a chance arises naturally. 
Similarly, the price of petrol strictly identical to all service stations is surely due to chance and hard struggle of competition. 
"The office did not identify, on this subject, signs of a anticompétitif behaviour, it therefore has no right to intervene in one way or another." 
None of the operators has a dominant position, none of it was therefore a corresponding responsibility more of its behaviour in the market. 
The tools necessary to opening up the mobile market for virtual operators are probably even the telecommunications regulator, "said in its statement Chaloupa." 
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of contention. 
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets, drawn up by the?TÚ that telecommunications are, from the standpoint of economic rivalry, a single market. 
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market. 
However, some legal experts propose a different view of things: for the creation of a virtual operator is possible, we must obtain, each time, the consent of the network operator. 
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network. 
Thus it is necessarily a dominant role in a certain segment of the business. 
But even without admit this argument, it should at least be worrying for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are clearly in a similar way. 
However, the complaints of many interested (including society GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they are in negotiations with all operators, similar constraints. 
To place the blame on the?TÚ is a fairly common in communications, by means of which the ÚOHS is washing his hands of the matter. 
We have already seen this kind of attitude in several similar cases. 
It has unfortunately failed to pass in the novélisation of the law on telecommunications, recently adopted a broadening of the powers of the?TÚ on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised an improvement in the situation. 
This, the representatives of the ÚOHS should very well know, but their interests are apparently the other. 
When nobody is watching, it can walk 
That said, the functioning of a kind of virtual pseudo operators in the mobile networks, several Czech, remains unnoticed. 
It is companies issuing their own list of prices of mobile telephone services, but these are public in part. 
In most cases, it is a question of firms in charge of multi level marketing. 
Particularisés mobile telephone services are offered by example by Amway, Bohemia Starlife Telecom, and others. 
The lists of prices of these companies are generally to the elected representatives. 
The wave of a magic wand, consists in the fact that the company done before the operator is a classic business customer, which commands a great deal of SIM cards. 
As an important customer, it gets offers price (and others) special. 
The problem is that business conditions of all mobile operators Czech ban such fishing. 
"If there is what you suggest, it could be a violation of contractual conditions we will be examining and which could lead to a suspension of cooperation with the company in question," has answered our question on this issue Kemrová Martina. 
However, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity has failed so far to the leaders of the mobile operators. 
Particularly in the case of the three companies mentioned there could be thousands of customers. 
Auncun operator, however, opposes such a procedure. 
In fact, the activities of these companies make their profits non-négligeables, and, at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own marketing official. 
Miroslav?epický indicates possible problem: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are only used by a percentage of customers negligible." 
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot be fully, to the way ordinary customers mobile operators. " 
Well, that is precisely what should seem strange to?TÚ. 
In addition, there is another question to the ÚOHS. 
If the mobile operators are turning a blind eye to such a procedure, why blocking the creation of a virtual operator? 
It should be added that the ÚOHS have fairly broad powers to disclose such activity, and if he does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of operators, who say they have no idea that this would happen, banning their contractual conditions. 
When we no longer the most expensive country 
As we have already said several times, the entry of virtual operators in the mobile market has made a considerable drop in the price of services. 
Well, almost in every country where appeared of virtual operators, the traditional operators are efforçaient, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation. 
The arguments used by the United States was practically the same - a market too small or too crowded, problems with the quality of services, etc. 
However, it is precisely at this level that have occurred in the developed countries, the regulators, who advocated not the interests of the mobile operators, but those of their clients. 
Both through formal and informal pressure, they ended up getting the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators treat this issue in the way of a hot potato which are disposed of in the passing on a target close. 
Following the experiences that we have, we cannot do away with the impression that the confusion in their skills in such cases more than profitable. 
But we must not give up so easily. 
If the information of the scenes are true and a virtual operator will appear soon at home, the Czech mobile market resumes perhaps moving. 
If one of the operators accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will not remain impassive in the face of the rejection (discrimination) other interested. 
And we stop perhaps to call more expensive than in the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech anthem has four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem. 
Sunday, on the occasion of the Day of Czech citizenship, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov m?j (To what extent is my homeland?). 
The anthem has again been recorded by the orchestra of the National Theater under the direction of B?lohlávek Jiší. 
We have four versions - with a song solo male or female, an interpretation with chorus and an instrumental version. 
The song is ensured by Kate?ina Kn??ínková and Adam Plachetka. 
Otakar Jeremiá? and Jaroslav Kr?ek are the authors of the arrangements of music. 
You can listen to the four new versions on the server. iHNed cz. 
B?lohlávek sees the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns. 
As he had already left before the?eský rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he has chosen to interpret the versions solo singers with voices young and representative, which are marked and appreciated. 
"From the beginning, I was trying to take care that the two singers - as well as the choir, have a good walking, so that it is well understood that they are singing the words, so simultaneously," he said. 
The Czech national anthem will be celebrating next year, his 175è anniversary. 
The song Kde m?j domov Lienemann for the first time in 1834 on the planks of Stavovské divadlo Theater (the states) in Fidlova?ka (Kermesse of savetiers), original, Czech Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František?kroup. 
It has become popular and people have spontaneously appropriate. 
After the creation of the Tchécoslaovaquie in 1918, the first breath became naturally part of the national anthem. 
It demeura one of seven national symbols, even after the creation of the Czech Republic independent. 
How sounds the "new" anthem 
Public transport (MHD) Prague will introduce, on Wednesday, the chip in their ticketing system 
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008 will be part of the history of the Pra?ský Dopravní podnik (the agency pragoise Transport) as the date on which will set up in the metro, trams and buses the first passengers, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have in their pocket an electronic coupon. 
At the moment, it is accessible to about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card. 
Passengers can purchase a coupon 30 days or 90 days (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both the register on their smart card in the points of information and the offices of the Dopravní podnik Agency (transport), located in the underground stations Muzeum, M?stek, Nádra?í Hole?ovice, And?l, Roztyly, Let?any, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Ka?erov and Luka. 
As of yesterday, there is also the possibility of buying on the Internet by avoiding the Dopravní websites podnik: www. dpp. cz. 
More than 400 people profitèrent service during the morning. 
Those who will begin to use the shop online can forget definitively the counters in the underground stations, where they were until now speak of impatience in long lines in order to obtain tickets on paper. 
In fact, they will buy their coupon by Internet and we will see on their card Opencard in one of the 13 M?stská knihovna municipal libraries (). 
"In these contact points, there are at the disposal of passengers a counter with trained staff, which will help the concerned with buying over the Internet and, moreover, will see the coupon that they have bought on their card," said the spokesman of the project Martin Opatrný. 
In addition to the libraries, it will be possible to register the electronic on the Opencard avoiding in coin-operated machines installed in the vestibule of several underground stations. 
What these distributors? 
They are red, remind us of the machines to composter the tickets and passengers may already have the similarities in the underground stations Roztyly, Bud?jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská. 
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be 80," added Opatrný. 
An automaton will control the coupon instead the driver 
Vending machines which will operate as from tomorrow, are easy to use. 
It is enough to introduce the smart card Opencard and the coupon bought earlier is going to register itself on the map. 
The electronic avoiding is valid from tomorrow, not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city. 
Namely in trains and bus lines suburban areas is 300 to 439, that use essentially the inhabitants of Commons Central Bohemian for access to the capital. 
"In trains, embedded in Pra?ská integrovaná integrated transport doprava (Prague), the inspectors are equipped with card readers, with which they establish the validity of avoiding temporary and zoning," explained the control of the organisation of Drápal Filip tickets Ropid, shapes the timetables of Prague public transport. 
Suburban areas is buses are equipped with card readers incorporated into the coffers of the driver. 
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but we must also put the Opencard at the right place on the side of the checkout. 
This is how the driver control the validity of avoiding registered. 
"If the passenger would need to check the validity of avoiding registered, there is nothing easier than to request this information to the driver," compléta Drápal. 
Passengers who do not take buses suburban areas is and does not recall the date expires the validity of their coupon, can join again the vending machines, originally used to record the avoiding on the map. 
That is, on the screen of the device that will display information about the validity of their document. 
The Sudeten region called for a referendum in the US 
Sudeten Germans demanded in 1945 to what?umava is included in the United States. 
This is a letter tabled in the collections of the Jiho?eská v?decká scientific knihovna (The Library of Bohemia in the south). 
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America. 
In 1945, certain groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly was addressed to the President of the United States with such a desire. 
This results in a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now tabled in the collections of the Jiho?eská v?decká knihovna. 
Germans of?eský Krumlov praying in the letter the President of the United States not to allow "?umavská?upa" (region of forests in southern Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler in accordance with the agreement of Munich - should be returned to Czechoslovakia. 
"We have understood the situation and want to be really sure that the words saying that American troops come on German territory not by oppressors and enemies but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed "people, to which the fate of the?umava dear to my heart." 
Since the donning of Czechoslovakia is allegedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - that of brutality, attitude and respects, incomprehension, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter urge the American president to take in its hands the protectorate of the?umava for now and forever. 
"We cannot believe, that you accorderiez this territory to a state that is alien to us, which oppresses and destroys the minorities and who has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies, without taking into account the opinion of the quarter of a million people," is written in the letter. 
The reason for alleged that the authors could not sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge "Czech oppressors." 
If the US president doubted the views of the Germans?umava, it would only have to organise, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish if its inhabitants wanted to be part of the US, or live in the United States. 
Although the text contained in the letter can, given the current knowledge of the history of the postwar period, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of the time. 
While the Germans Czech should at least see that the question of the expulsion of the republic will arise, very few of them are avouaient such a possibility. 
Some promised that the United States and Britain would get to the Sudeten region a certain type of autonomy. 
Others believed that they would quite simply Czechoslovakia. 
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in?eské Bud?jovice confirms this. 
During the war, he was, as a German of?eské Bud?jovice, engaged in the Navy in the Baltic countries. 
Lorsqu "at the end of the war, he was captured by the British and placed in the camp of catching the region Holstein, dozens of ethnic Germans from the Czech doctor for that they learn Czech. 
"They believed that once back home, Czech they will benefit," said Chalupa. 
None of the Germans captured who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war is believed, according to him, that after the Décrets Beneš, he would be expelled from the republic. 
You do not have thought - you paies! 
An emotional campaign will drivers 
The road safety action targeting the most expensive in the history of the Czech Republic. 
One way of describing the emotional media campaign and launch, on Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport. 
The office of the minister Ale??ebí?ek believes that it will discourage drivers of a dangerous behaviour at the wheel. 
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, radio, movies, on the Internet, but also on leaflets. 
It should discourage drivers driving fast and drink-driving. 
But also remind them to take the belt before starting. 
It is primarily affect the conscience of younger drivers, motorcycle, pedestrians, without forgetting the professional drivers. 
What will appear in the spots? 
Above all the personal stories that are going to attack the emotions. 
Witness also the slogan "bloody" throughout the campaign. 
You do not have thought - you paies! 
The phrase "thou do not thoughtful" is writ large on the registration plate. 
Then, in a puddle of blood, there is the phrase "thou paieras." 
What needs to be a symbol that we can pay to life for a moment of insufficient attention. 
The commercials are "haunt" the spectators until 2010. 
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see commonly pictures with drastic images of victims of accidents. 
He believes that this will lead to a reduction in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on the roads Czech. 
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG. 
The strategy of sugar and whip against drivers 
"What is working with the drivers, this is the system of sugar and whip." 
For them, sugar is represented by, for example, to save time, when they grillent a red light. 
The whip is the threat of fines or an accident. 
The risks are worth repeating the drivers, "said Martin Ko?án, the psychologist transport Na Homolce hospital." 
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, believes the psychologist. 
Signs pointing out the danger to drivers are, according to him, already less effective. 
"When a static billboard which warns against a danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the drivers will see more," signala Ko?án. 
Olmert would make in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories 
Ehud Olmert, the president of the interim government in Israel, said in favour of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria. 
He made that statement in an interview published on Monday by the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. 
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the territories (occupied), if not all," said Olmert on a daily basis. 
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we must give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), because otherwise, peace will not happen, '" he added. 
He admitted that the return possible would include East Jerusalem. 
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem, and especially does not want the tractors and bulldozers to crush the feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to relinquish parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, referring to the two attacks in the city, in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people injured. 
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a solution for the Temple Mount, the holy places and historical" located within the old city. 
"Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will be forced to integrate 270 000 Arabs." 
It will not work, "he emphasized." 
Retreat from the Golan Heights 
Olmert is said also in favour of the retreat of Israel from the Golan Heights, which is, according to him, a prerequisite for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria. 
But also, it would require some effort on the part of Damascus. 
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retreat from the Golan Heights," signala? 
"The Syrians know very well what they are going to have to give up the Golan." 
They will have to manage their current relations with Iran; they will have to manage their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to renounce the constant support they are giving to the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), of the Al - Kaïda (terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (holy war) in Iraq, "précisa Prime Minister." 
Issues that arise after the accident, the stewards in because they are illegal? 
The law ignored; walk in a long-distance is forbidden. 
In the context of the tragic crash of the coach of society Student Agency near Padua, Italy, arises the question whether the stewards and passengers can during the journey to move inside the coach. 
"If we wanted to respect the law and strictly formal, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said the spokesman of the Department of Transportation Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, during which has killed a hôtesse aged 22 years, was apparently caused by the driver of a lorry which cross the path of the coach. 
The girl was at this point unfortunately seated beside the driver seat, on the most dangerous of the vehicle, although she has at its disposal other two seats. 
However, the coach can have an accident, or curb so blunt, also at a time when the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers. 
What matters is if the coach is under its technical fitted sheet seats upright or not. 
If this equipment for seats upright is not approved, passengers must remain seated. 
Coaches long-distance Student Agency have no seats upright; that was confirmed in Aktuáln?. cz by the director of the company Jan?ura Radim. 
"It is a question that we have discussed with the ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits any movement of passengers." 
Then they have cancelled and we achieved that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey, on condition that they had their own seat, "he revealed his position." 
The law ignores the steward 
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward - prescription legal deals with that role." 
On the other hand, no legal prescription does not prohibit either the carrier to offer services. 
The law on road transport is only the word of recipients of vehicle; it does not define its rights and duties, "adds more ambiguity spokesman Hanzelka." 
Josef Pokorný, the director of the Department of the movement of road vehicles, think that the law treats sufficiently the issue. 
"Everything depends on the fact if the coach has in its approval permission to offer seats upright." 
Everything is all that, "he says." 
Coaches are divided into urban, where there are seats upright and a maximum speed limit, long-distance with seats upright and speed allowed higher and long-distance buses without place standing with the maximum speed the highest and the seats fitted with seat-belts. 
As the plane, said an expert 
Jaroslav Ho?ín, an expert on BESIP (security) in road traffic safety in transport, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem. 
"During a regular movement, there is no danger." 'the situation can be compared to that of the aircraft in service. " 
Here again, it is not certain when will be a turbulence and the hôtesse air can beat your head. " 
"However, if the coach would have resulted in a sharp, the laws of physics would obviously be valid." 
In the same way that in a city bus or a tram. 
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards by internal regulations, "he says, and also think that from the point of view of the law, the issue is not settled." 
Jan?ura is prepared to remove these services 
Student Agency is the only carrier coach to offer the services of stewards. 
He hired two cent. 
Even after this incident, the director does not view their job as a profession. 
"However, as soon as I have the impression that it is a craft to risk, I supprimerai." 
Passengers can receive their coffee and their newspaper at boarding. 
It could also downgrade the costs, "he says." 
The concern of security is the reason that gives the absence of stewards in cars, the director of the Asiana Alexei Litvine, which, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines. 
"We have no stewardesses." 'we object since the beginning. " 
Sooner or later it will end by a fatal accident, "he said, there is a years, Týden." 'cz. " 
A great tragedy came 
A young hôtesse region's Plzeš, who worked for the company for two years, has died at the accident on the line in Naples. 
A Slovenian truck has probably quité the hard without using clignotant and he blocked the road to the coaches. 
The driver of the latter to try to avoid it by means of a sudden, but it was close by his side right. 
Jan?ura refuse that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards have been sold. 
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are maintained. 
The company intends to sue the driver of the truck. 
For the compensation to the family of the girl, the agency will not wait for the court, but as far as the financial compensation, it is also on the guilty. 
An amendment to the law? 
Not in sight 
An amendment to the law, which is being drawn up, for more than a year, by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport, could give more details regarding the movement of stewards on board the coaches. 
"However, it has not led to any conclusion on this point." 
In fact, it is not interested too buses, but rather the points system, to the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile at the wheel, "said the expert Ho?ín." 
"The Department of Transportation does not regard the activity of stewards as something that would fundamentally undermine the safety of passengers," concludes the spokesman Hanzelka, specifying that the control of the safety of coaches is under the power of the police and the office for safety at work. 
The hopes of Düsseldorfois are based on Frankfurt. 
The big words do not lack in a letter to the Board of Directors of the WestLB to employees of the house. 
In a union of entities of the Dusseldorf with the financial institute, Deka Bank in Frankfurt, "the central institution of the financial markets of the financial group of the Sparkasse" could be, according to the letter made public Monday. 
The WestLB would bring a "bloc of competence," coupled with a sustainable productivity in such a case. 
After all, such a relationship could be the decisive kick-off to other mergers in the sector of the banks of the Länder. 
That is what it is like when a Conciliation Board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times. 
Because the WestLB, wounded, is still a great pressure. 
This is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Services of Surveillance Authority Financiers who has, it only recently made it clear to the government in the Land of Rhenanie Nord- Westfalie that time was running out in the search for a solution in the future. 
It is a question for some time, also on the side of Frankfurt - a kind of a relationship between the bank Deka, who knows the customers of the Sparkasse through their investment funds, and the WestLB. 
Certainly the leader of the Deta - Bank Franz Waas said when presenting figures of six months in late August that he had no sense in the merger of the home of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, whether the Helaba or WestLB. 
However the Board of Directors of the Deka, which every half is borne by the banks of the Länder and by groups of funds of savings, instructed the committee director to lead talks with the WestLB, for commercial activities. 
He might be the flow of the financial market, or parts of it. 
The talks come, however, only to begin, as we say in the financial market. 
This is not the first time that the Deta - Bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, account for one of the most important employers on the financial centre of Frankfurt, comes into play when it comes to consolidation in the sector of the coffers of savings. 
In 2003 we thought for a moment that the Deta - Bank could merge with the bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinate and the Halbab. 
Nothing is yet evident from this ternaire mix. 
Hardly the plans had they been made public that the government of Hessen State gave its verdict against any participation of the Hellaba in them. 
Later, the other two houses either do not rejoignèrent. 
The bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinate, was incorporated into the way to the bank of the Land of Bade - Wuttenberg in Stuttgart. 
But there was always new talks on the reunification of the Deka - Bank with banks of the Länder. 
Finally, Günther Merl, chairman of the steering committee of the Hellaba, however, had spoken out against any trade strategy of merging with his bank. 
That notwithstanding, the sentiment seems to spread that the combination of the various establishments of the public sector is particularly urgent. 
Now that the election to the House of the Land of Bavaria has passed, a union of BayernLB with the bank of the Land of Bade - Wuttenberg could result in the first. 
For the Helaba, this is not particularly good news. 
If the pressure which compels us to new mergers were to increase, the possible partners beyond him. 
In the south, it is now a junior partner, although she has so far better withstood the crisis that the banks of Munich and Stuttgart. 
The grouping of savings banks and transfers of Hesse, and Thuringia, which owns 85% of the capital of the Helaba, has, however, learned the lock at the beginning of the year on any union with the WestLB. 
The rigour remain at NordLB. 
Such thoughts géo-stratégiques does, however, that one of the aspects. 
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can be matched. 
In June, Merl said that the key issue, namely through what commercial model the viability of the banks of the Länder should be guaranteed, had not previously resolved by the German association of savings banks and transfers. 
In the longer term, a carve-up of the WestLb could take place, carve-up which here is obviously not liked. 
That is also what is discussed in the letter of the Conciliation Board in place: in any case, would be referred to a "global solution" for the establishment. 
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta - Bank remains to be seen. 
The second weekend of the festival of beer is also known as the weekend of Italians. 
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time. 
But this time, Elena accompanies it as a girlfriend, and therefore nothing is the same, he says. 
Behind them, almost a Danaides' five litres of beer brand name, Kaiser, is a bearded well built which shows to around 200 visitors of the celebration of beer what sounds profound his gosier can produce. 
Elena attack by Luca, then the kisses. 
In Bologna, they have travelled to Verona. 
From then on, the station Puorta road near the station nueva, four buses take this evening beginning at 11.45pm, "destinazione Monaco festa della birra arrival," scheduled to 6h30. 
Three buses are earmarked primarily for the Italian, in one of the bus travel of brésilens exclusively. 
In a corner of the park, the South American mantra of ors and already alongside their flag, they have already celebrated last night. 
And noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it is not for the Italians. 
Buses belong to Marco, which is a long coat doubled to fake fur and glasses for the broader pairs silver eels. 
For five years, they are going to the celebration of beer, already three virées this year alone. 
They go at night, remain the day of the festival, and come home at 10.30pm. 
Night would involve unnecessary costs, explains Marco. 
The trip costs 75 euros, including the pot Kaiser welcome with a beer, brewed in accordance with the law of Bavarian purity, health insurance and a head of the group speaking German - Marco did a language courses in Frankfurt. 
And already the buses are driving at night on the Autostrada direction "Brennero." 
There is no beer, not yet. 
Soon, everything is calm in the bus, passengers sleep. 
It is better that way, they will still need them. 
The breaks will be made in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while many other buses with Italian number-plates numbers are once again a break shortly before Munich, on the motorway 8. 
When in the early morning, the group of Marco is finally coming to six hours 30 as scheduled on the car park near the place Thérèse almost 50 other buses across Europe are already here. 
Elena, Luca and the others are assembling, Marco takes a final speech, explains the plan of attack. 
Firstly, to override the small yellow hat. 
It is written on the Left "Day of beer," Gothic, and alongside the address of the travel agency of Marco "conoscersiviaggiando. it. ' 
Secondly: "When the doors of the tent of beer are opened up, there is," shouts Marco in the small hours. 
"Run!" run and push the squares at the bottom of the tent. 
"Not before, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow hats on the same benches, they must be spread in the room!" 
The chope, squealing Marco, costing 8.25 euros. 
And do not forget the instruction. 
"Show the security officials that we behave well! 
As soon as you are leaving your current seats, they are gone! " 
Thirdly: "This evening, be returned here has ten and a half years stack!" correctly? 
And that is, it is party to the celebration of beer. 
On the road, someone yellow hats able to recover the path to trees, signs and even to an election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party. 
We would like to be ready for the return journey. 
This is the second weekend of the festival of beer, known as the "weekend of Italian." 
There are no precise figures; we talk about 50 000 who put themselves at road through the Alps and collapse in the newspaper stand, 10% of the visitors would come sprinter class of Italy this weekend. 
The police munichoise is reinforced by seven police officers of the South Tyrol Transit Forum, by rescue forces wearing Italian volunteers who support the Bavarian Red Cross which implements a statistic on the countries where the Italian occupies first place in the British (60 points) and Austria (approximately 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions. 
The one that is particularly valued by the Italian is the attempt of the brewery Hofbräu. 
Nights of sleep for the shareholders of Hypo Real Estate 
The banking system is relatively stable, German Federal Finance Minister insisted it was only a few weeks ago. 
What chance that the politician had used the word "relatively" and that it glissait German banker that the sector would not be spared by the movements of crisis. 
It is indeed that occurred this weekend. 
The Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the DAX gets a consortium of German banks a credit of one billion to protect themselves from the turbulence of the markets. 
A person into his confidence to the situation said to Reuters on Monday that the aid appropriations are granted up to EUR 35 billion. 
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction of what it would be right. 
The money comes as many private banks and banks of public law. 
In the background, it is society - daughter Depfa sustaining losses. 
The financial state had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible for because of distrust of the markets. 
In the first half of 2008, the reserve liquidity of the bank had been reduced by 95% to 2.37 million, the rate of own capital also had slightly declined from 1.6 to 1,45%. 
The gains in net and those from financial transactions were, by comparison with the same period last year, at ground zero, the income from the allocation of debts and certain securities and the termination of reserves in the operations of credit had fallen by more than 70% to 5 million. 
And it was only thanks to the significant benefits of the reimbursement of costs accounting downstream from the restructuring of the former group Depfa, as well as the interest payments, according to the book tax procedures and commercial purchases for companies of Konzern that the deficit of the gains of around 16% has proved to be moderate. 
After its privatisation in 1990, the former financial state was initially wrongly speculated on credits industrial estate, which then were filialisés at the bank Aareal. 
Because what the state funding classic was not quite profitable, Depfa then committed more intensively in the projects of infrastructure and the funding of projects in common between private investors and state (Privat - Public Partnership (PPP) and diversified internationally. 
On the value of the company - daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must proceed with amortization which should be on the calculation of gains and losses of the group an essential material effect which is quite unclear. 
The fact is that dividends were cut off. 
Already for 2007, they had been truncated to two thirds. 
The Hypo Real Estate is, since the takeover of the state, an investor Depfa infrastructure and highly important. 
It is more solid than other institutes dependent on the inter- bank because it has no deposit customers. 
With the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of funds between banks has once again toned tari, banks have accumulated their liquidity. 
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part - about 50 Milliards euros - all the appropriations Depfa a means for short-term refinancing. 
According to a press release of the Hypo Real Estate, the need for funding of the group is covered with the medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of the financial markets largely out of running at the moment. 
Other sources say that the refinancing would be guaranteed through the funds until the end of 2009. 
The chairman of the board of HRE Georg Funke explained, however, that the group Hypo Real Estate should be confined to the financial markets in the medium term. 
The Federal Reserve and the House for the Federal Services of Surveillance Financiers (Bafin) who assume that the capacity of the group Hypo Real on the market is now assured. 
Shareholders and creditors of the bank has more than hoped. 
However, in view of the dynamic and the impondérabilité of the crisis, there is no certainty. 
It is not unthinkable that we should not use the funding in all its breadth. 
But the opposite either cannot be ruled out. 
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest reports, yet at the gates of insolvency Sunday at the end of the evening, this rescue at least provisional will not reassure people either. 
The share price has fallen from 75% to 3,30 euros. 
The prices of bonds, by contrast, are doing particularly well. 
While the debt primarily have barely budged, the loans of secondary flagging. 
The worst affected are mainly investment funds of the former company - daughter Württemberg Hypo and those, of course, which have a life beyond 2009. 
The obligations of the bank Hypo Real Estate previously to be a placement of speculation alternative, now their value should be seen as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the tightening net of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution even include the crisis in the establishment by the takeover of the bank Depfa. 
As long as the issuing bodies, governments and commercial banks less affected are still prepared to support the system, we can assume a reduction of arrears in time. 
Or will that no one would hope at the moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the 15 months. 
But in the face of the noise renouvellés partial renationalization of yesterday, the likelihood that security has now become a mere hope founded. 
This should give the nights of sleep primarily to creditors in the long run on the decision of whether they have to part of their commitments. 
Short-term investors can always use what they have drawn a line to be a postponement of losses for the next few years on the next tax on capital income stock market gains automatically paid. 
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box 
When Hiltrop Sylvana, 16 years, must be present for the first day of the Highschool of Tachibana, girls are beginning to giggle at: the German is so "kawaii"! 
What is it, that they are doing? 
Sylvana already knows the word thanks to the Mangas - in its new Log exchanges, it speaks of Japan. 
"The first day of classes in Japan." 
What is it, that I was excitée. 
Already the way to go to school, I was afraid. 
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes until the Highschool of Tachibana. 
I find the road alone, fortunately I have not lost. 
The start of course does not seem to be set so stringent that here in Lower Saxony. 
Students appear one after the other from eight hours, until nine at twenty, a round table discussion begins with the teacher, the "home room." 
But before the process starts, it was for me to present it. 
I am not the sort to love to talk to people, particularly in a class of 40 students. 
As I had not yet the uniforms of school, I have made my mother an old jupe host, as well as a rising blue shirt, socks and black leather shoes. 
In this place, therefore, I have presented to the rostrum, and have tried to pronounce properly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - I am called Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week. 
At that time, I was very pleased to have started to learn the language there two years ago. 
The 31 girls in the class have all been whispering, pouffé laugh and making signs, and I have always heard the word 'Kawaii. " 
I already knew through my mangas. 
It is up to the vocabulary essential to the survival of ados Japanese and means "beautiful, cabbage." 
Then I quickly slipped to my seat. 
The girl next to me has made me a big smile ironic, it found that it was an honour that the corresponding should sit down next to her. 
The rest of the time was quite calm, but when the drumming was music, I was stormed in the rules. 
Everyone spoke at, pouffait laugh and asked me a lot of issues - in this case, it is rather difficult to understand the Japanese English. 
During the break, they all come out their Bento. 
My mother had also been host to this kind of Lunchbox - this is really something other than the paltry snacks in Germany. 
I had the rice aromatic herbs, small sausages, a salad of cucumber and seaweed, fruit and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu. 
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan. 
Things have a bizarre appearance and a taste completely new. 
What is certain is that everything is really good. 
Well, except perhaps plums, salt confites brrrr! 
The Bentos lunches are not only in Japanese schools. 
It sometimes happens that a girl offers a boy a Bento she has prepared itself, and which is then prepared very carefully, in the hope of being able to do a little better knowledge of the boy during the break. 
I read it in my mangas. 
I am curious to know if I could observe also here. 
"Why Japan in particular?" asked me my friends when I told them I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo. 
I have always responded. 
"Because it fascinates me, what ' 
In the end, read the mangas, that is what I prefer already for years. 
And in order to better understand the mangas and culture who is, at a time, I have also begun to learn the Japanese. 
For me, it was very clear that I had to travel a day. 
Because I also have a soft spot for the traditions, customs and habits. 
And here, it gives them a lot of importance. 
On the one hand, Japan is the country of technology and the latest trends, on the other hand, it is tough, disciplined and traditional. 
And as everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even if Tokyo is the world's largest city that I have ever seen. " 
Rats also have sensations 
A rat or a cold turkey is leaking before the danger, is it - that it means that we also fear? 
The neurophysicien Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have also sensations. 
But how can anyone check that it have the same thing when it behaves in the same way than we are? 
In the online magazine Edge, "" contributions are published for several years by famous scientists. 
Spiegel Online presents in a series of answers to the question "what do you be true without power in having proof?" 
I believe that animals have different sensations and other states of awareness without me or anyone else has until now been able to prove just as we cannot prove that the other human beings have a conscience. 
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains are the same situation. 
As soon as we look to other species, and that we are dealing with the issues of felt or in general to the conscience, we are entering into the difficult terrain because the Hardware does not. 
When a rat is in danger, he is doing the same thing that many other animals: it is the death, fled or attack. 
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a subjective experience comparable. 
However, I do not think so. 
Two aspects of the structure of the brain makes the transposition of our experienced subjective to that of the animals difficult. 
One of the aspects is that almost always associated circuits in the human conscience include the latéral Cortex préfrontal (of its participation in the short-term memory and in senior management and implementation). 
This vast region is much more highly developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be entirely absent among other people. 
Therefore, at least for those aspects of our conscience who depend on préfrontal Cortex, including the conscience of who we are, and the ability to predict and to decide, it is reasonable to assume that human beings differentiates itself from other primates. 
Another significant feature might lie in the nature of mankind: a large part of its existence is related to language, it often means that its conscience depends on it. 
In this case, it could exclude the animals. 
But even if the conscience should not depend on the language, it certainly influence the awareness, so that the animal, regardless of how it is produced, probably would differ a great deal of most of our states of consciousness. 
That is why it is so difficult to determine what may look like awareness among other animals. 
If that, internally and subjective, does not measure or, because of this particular Hardware, analyse based on our own experience, his comment raises serious problems. 
Most of my developments make reference to the content of the experienced aware, but there are also another aspect of the conscience who should be more easily accessible scientifically. 
We could look at the process of conscience animals without taking account of their content, and that is exactly what happened during studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly with the example of the display. 
But in this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, it focuses more on the correlations nervous aware on the mechanisms causals: both can be identical or not. 
Curiously, this approach also underlines the importance of Cortex in the achievement of the préfrontal display. 
But that result and for the emotions? 
I understand that a system of emotions such as fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity. 
What we set as "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the localized defence system in the brain (or its aftermath, as the reaction of the body) steals the memory alive. 
And observed, emotions are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterise the primates, especially human beings. 
Subtle degrees of felt, coupled with our volubile nature, have been identified, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiation and categorise the state to attribute it to others. 
By contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believe that the sensations from primitive activities are born in the regions of the body of the sensational Cortex and the waistline strokes, as Jaak Pankseep which focuses on the waistline but more strokes. 
As this network has not much changed in the course of human evolution, it may quite involved transversal sensations of any type. 
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict him, but I believe that to prove. 
Pankseep argues that what is stated as a fear among the Hommes and in rats is probably also identified as such in both cases: how could anyone yet whether the rats and the Hommes feel the same thing when they behave alike? 
A cold turkey is leaking before the danger, but if he feels fear? 
In my view, such behaviour is not enough to prove the experienced identical. 
Admittedly, the comparison nervous aid: rats and possess similar brain troncs Hommes, the cafards, however, do not have a brain. 
But is it - that the waistline strokes is at the root of the sensations? 
And even if we could show this to mankind: how could we demonstrated in rats? 
I believe that the rats and other mammals, perhaps even the cafards (who knows?) have sensations. 
But I would not now know how to prove it. 
And because their sensations that somebody is probably completely with us (since the human conscience is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior as the sensations emotional rats. 
In any case, progress on the plan poignent nervous because we registered the same thing in rats and among human beings. 
As I is not exploring the language and the conscience in rats, nor the sensations, I do not know if they exist. 
We could judge this as the short term, but I prefer to make rather than bumping into things constantly against a wall. 
I am indeed a émotionel pragmatic. 
Platini, president of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine 
Iwan Wasjunik Deputy Prime Minister has explained that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister. 
"The government regards UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and in his ability to organise, in cooperation with Poland, the European Championship", announced Wasjunik. 
"But this is not an amnesty for our country." 
The work has just started, and there is still much to do in the two countries. " 
In the timetable for the construction or the destruction of the stadium, the streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts run after the deadline. 
The number of stadiums for the European Championships could possibly be reduced from eight to six. 
"We cannot afford to lose more time." 
We must work to the maximum speed, "said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis." 
"UEFA has continually." 
Even tougher action was decided in Poland. 
The direction of the PZPN Polish football league has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator. 
The committee met on the request of the Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
"There is a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act within the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish press agency pap. 
"We have assured in a letter to the President of UEFA that preparations for the 2012 European Championnat did not suffer." 
Several members of the League of Premiership were in the previous season, already sentenced for manipulation of compulsory relegation; in the end, the beginning of the League has even been décalé at the last minute. 
Dennis Quaid outraged Strikes Back 
She wanted to make the promotion for a new film, spoke about his private life in an interview - and is now having trouble with his ex: the fight against Hollywood's star Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on his former adultérin Dennis Quaid. 
He dregs - and counter-attack. 
A war of the late Rose for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are engaged in a battle grace - in full view of everyone. 
Last week, Meg Ryan was expressed in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle on the causes of the failure of marriage: "Dennis has long been unfaithful, and it was very painful." 
It would have been aware of the extent of deception only after the divorce. 
The reason for this is the thought of striptease press relations of Ryan for his new film "the Women" - is told the story of an adultery. 
The reaction of Dennis Quaid on their qualification of unfaithful husband fell clearly: it would be "Monstrueux", said that the "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg remâche again the history of our relationship and the handle." 
That would be more "regrettable" that the "pain and upheaval that contain a divorce for every child have again rekindled in public" for their son together for 16 years, Jack. " 
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarié and will soon become the father of twins. 
So was his response to the coup of gentle leadership: "In any case, my life continues." 
I feel happy to have a wonderful family who will at best. " 
Airfares and hotels fell 
In the first half of the year 2008, flights and nights of hotels were cheaper than the previous year. 
In Germany, according to a study at present, flights actually up has 50%. 
Flights and nights of hotel would again become advantageous - this is the result of a study of the provider of financial services and travel American Express. 
The company analyzed its data people booked on the first half of 2008 and has established, after a rise in prices in the first quarter, a sharp drop in profits in the second quarter. 
After the market price hotels have increased over the years, the nights of hotels have already reduced in many areas. 
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities examined again by 6.9% on average compared with 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined. 
From April to June, prices were, however, already 3.6% lower than the previous year. 
The trend has been clear to Paris and Rome, where travellers were paid 30 to 37% less than a year earlier. 
The causes of all this résideraient for American Express in the low value of the dollar, which has led to a "desire to travel to drop in American tourists." 
The financial centres such as Frankfurt or London would be even more affected by the decline in the price of hotels that the industrial sites as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger. 
In the Swedish town, the price of hotels are taking place with an increase of 26,3%, the highest in Europe. 
Also in terms of price of flights, the trend was the increase in the first quarter. 
Because of the increase in the price of kerosene, economy class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1% more than in 2007, long-haul flights, most consumers of fuel, have even increased up to 29.2%. 
From April to June, the economy class ticket prices have fallen by an average of 12.5% in comparison with the previous quarter, in business class and first class, however, the price variations were far less intense. 
In Germany, prices have plummeted in an even more important than in other European countries: 
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9%, in the second quarter, prices fell 23.6%. 
German domestic flights have been divided by two according to the study. 
The reasons for the fall in prices would be a economic growth slowing, explains the company. 
The request cèderait ground in many market segment of the travel by plane. 
On the other hand, there is some pressure heightened competition in the treaty "open skies" which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe. 
Sign of the tense situation is the removal by airlines of journey not profitable, and the high number of airlines that would have made the assessment during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies in Europe alone. 
Gladbach beats HSV 1: 0 
With a purpose and methods simple, SV Hamburg becomes first. 
In the Borussia, Luhukay still has not managed to find a eleven functional. 
Kristoffer Klein. grow. a hard landing for international player Marko Marin. 
Does the Gladbach do rentra that late in the game and its sights lifted to fail against the framework of the goal. 
His message was precisely formulated, he had gone out of his lips in a more persuasive. 
He knew simply that he was right. 
"We need this second goal," siffla Hermann Rieger in the lobby of the locker room of the arena of Hamburg. 
It was not going great thing in the locker room, the half was over, and most were stale in their place. 
Rieger was for nearly three decades the physiotherapist of HSV, it enjoys a high reputation as many old players. 
And that is why his request has been received in strategic places. 
Cornelius assistant coach and Jol has acquiesé has lifted the thumbs up to approve. 
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach Martin Jol of Hamburg. 
Whose orders appear to have been similar, and that it is with this second goal. 
The implementation has failed. 
"Not everything was very nice to see today," Marcel Jansen did later. 
Bastian Reinhard would "also wanted to be more relaxed." 
This 1: 0 (1: 0 at the half), the team of Hamburg due to a head strike successful by Mladen Petric (at the eleventh minute); and the fact that the very weak players for Gladbach could not do any harm to the weak players in Hamburg. 
"It was a dirty victory," Jol Marin summed up. 
The SV in Hamburg on Monday will be celebrating its 121 years ago. 
Already on Saturday afternoon, the fans have celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the fray and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen that showed their club as first of the class. 
It's going to be an anniversary without genuine celebration. 
"We know stand back," said Marcell Jansen. 
It is clear that the outcome of the picture reflects more the unpredictable nature of the first League that the dominance of his HSV. 
The team with its arrivals late committed - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the guardian of purpose Petric like Jansen débauché of FC Bayern - will certainly form slowly, but it was not yet. 
"We need more than charm and more demanding," Jol dribbles.

The dark influence on the flight of the space probes 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon leaves researchers perplexing: in this dark influence the speed of space probes during what is called the manoeuvres of support gravitationnel. 
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct. 
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flies in space. 
As a result of conductions fuel soon frozen, the death cryogène the threat. 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon is causing uneasiness among researchers - the anomaly of the support gravitationnel. 
The support gravitationnel is a manoeuvre of space probes, by which they receive an additional impetus in the field gravitationnel a heavenly body, the Earth for example. 
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel. 
The research américo - European probe Huygens used this device Casini - physical, like the Ulysses solar probe. 
This is what surprised researchers from elsewhere for years: the volants objects are not always 100% of the way in which they expected according to the respective laws of gravity. 
Much more irregularities occur at the level of speed. 
The probes are becoming the blue faster or slower. 
Until now, physicists could not explain this. 
They baptisèrent the anomaly of the support gravitationnel. 
Some experts feared that the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein, who described the attraction of this area because of the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct. 
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still believes hard as iron that Einstein chose and trying to explain the anomaly of the support gravitationnel with the help of so-called dark matter that astronomers will have identified in the universe. 
"The black could be responsible for this anomaly, an area that is too close to the earth," he writes. 
Researchers in the area are aware of the existence of the black only for about ten years. 
It included apparently her a force of attraction whose effect can be observed on other celestial bodies. 
It, however, is completely invisible, meaning that it would send nor reflects no electromagnetic radiation, particularly any light visible. 
According to the calculations of the scientific, black would be just a fifth of the mass of the universe. 
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free 
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released and that the Italian Foreign Minister the confirmed. 
Sudanese the kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros. 
During the shooting prior to the release, six hostage takers have been killed. 
In southern Egypt, five Germans have been kidnapped. 
The negotiations for ransom are already underway. 
The Germans are constantly in the sights of kidnappers. 
Welt Online painted the most important cases. 
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are apparently free. 
This has been communicated to the Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al - Arabija and Italian media. 
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after news of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and the other hostages have been freed." 
We are in the process of verifying their state of health, "said Frattini." 
The five the five German, Italian and Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions are doing well and are safe, announced the Egyptian national television. 
The 19 participants on the excursion in the desert should already be on the way to Cairo. 
The circumstances around the shooting before the release of the hostages are still unclear: the kidnappers would have been close to put an end to kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers rush. 
"The problem was solved." 
They agreed with a price, "said the agent." 
They were expected to collect the hostages ", when suddenly," this surprise "happened." 
Sudanese soldiers had shot this Sunday six of the abductors in the border region between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and had arrested two of them. 
The hostage takers had demanded a ransom of Germany amounting to six million; the money was to be released by the German woman from one of the hostages. 
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom 'said that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety. 
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to free the hostages feminine after the payment of the price. 
Men should be detained until the kidnappers have found a safe route to escape. 
The German embassy in Cairo has refused to make any comment on this story. 
Abuse of a beau-père "that led to the suicide ' 
A court has been informed that years of abuse inflicted by her beau-père led a woman to commit suicide. 
Michael Trerise, 57ans, Stithians, in Cornwall, was imprisoned for six years after he admitted eight counts of indecent channels of facts. 
The high court of Truro has referred it enjoyed regularly its belle-fille, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, 5 to 7 years. 
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death." 
The tribunal has been informed that Ms. Randle, who is 34 years old, was suicidée at home to Mutley, Plymouth 1 April 2007. 
Child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had attached and bandée before the force to sexual acts, while his mother was working at the local pub. 
Trerise and his wife were divorced in the 1980s, and it retourna live in Cornwall. 
His belle-fille sent to Plymouth. 
But the court has been told that Ms. Randle, assiduous volunteer of National Trust, was bedevilled the abuses that he had been badly beaten twice a week. 
The attorney general, Ramsey Quaife said in court that friends had told me that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfeuse and cyclist, seemed since 2006 "emotionally dead", and "had lost all hope for life." 
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, was found dead in his apartment in Plymouth. 
We believe she has suicidée by suffoquant with a plastic bag. 
Mr. affronta Randle the father of her daughter, who had also written a letter of confession which not so: "I consider and bandais regularly." 
"I have not abused them sexually." 
"I feel responsible for his death." 
The judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are really bizarre as abnormally attached, your victim should be certainly been terrorised, especially at the age of 7 years." 
"This unpleasant saga ended by the suicide of the victim." 
And what is even more astonishing is the fact that if it had made this gesture, his story would certainly never ended in court. " 
He added: "I would describe as his father and his mother, the effects of your crime had made for years on Stéphanie." 
"Without them, it would undoubtedly be now a young woman happy, promising, and success." 
Sentence for a loss of official data. 
The Cabinet Office ministerial officer who had forgotten, top secret documents in June on a train, will be condemned by the Official Secrets Act, has been able to the BBC. 
Man of the Ministry of Defense was moving when it oublia two documents highly classified, on a train in the direction of Waterloo. 
The documents are in the hands of the BBC before being handed over to the police. 
This is the most serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent. 
The BBC correspondent, Frank Gardner said that this episode had many people of Whitehall. 
"They thought it would have been between the walls of the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet Office" he said. 
The employee who cannot be named, is accused of violating the 8.1 section of the act, in other words, the clause that deals with the protection of information. 
The Crown Prosecution Service has suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the guardianship of the Metropolitan Police, given the sensitive nature of his work linked to the Committee Associé Services of Secrets 
He has lost the documents contained assessments on Al Qaeda as well as on the resources of the security forces in Iraq. 
It has been informed of the decision, on Monday morning and was then transported from home to a secret location. 
Construction companies against the bill B & B. 
British companies in the building may have to pay a bill of more than 80 million pounds to cover the rescue of the bank Bradford & Bingley. 
The government has provided 14 billion pounds to protect deposits of 2.6 million savers of Bradford & Bingleys. 
The interests of this loan will be paid by all companies who collect money savers, including 59 companies in the building. 
The Director-General of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said he is "irritating" to know that the companies and their members will have to pay the bill... 
The loan of pounds 14 billion will be repaid when mortgages of Bradford & Bingleys are released. 
But the interests that are at the same time increase, will be charged, every year, the 700 financial companies who collect the deposits. 
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC, that the 59 companies the building are included in the list. 
It is irritating to see that the institutions that have had a wise... must now pay some of the bills of the institutions that were much less cautious. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
It proclaims that every company must pay an amount proportional to the deposits that it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost. 
The Treasury believes that the interests of the loan will be in 2009, 450millions pounds. 
This means that companies must find GBP 81 million to settle the interests of the first year. 
Adrian Coles, chief executive of the company of the building trade committee, told the BBC that this decision it seemed unfair. 
It is "irritating" to see that the institutions that have had a cautious attitude during the recovery of the property market, must now pay for the institutions far less cautious. 
According to the BSA, no society has failed since 1945, the date of the first track record. 
"We must examine all aspects of this matter during the next few weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent the societies of the building and their members pay this hefty bill," said Mr. Cole. " 
The interests for 2009 cover seven months from the end of September this year until the end of March. 
In 2010, we will have to pay the interests of the whole year, which could also double. 
Given that companies are building organizations without shareholder, their member end up paying the bill either by higher taxes, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.

A former Pm of Bangladesh has refused to bail 
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a request for bail to the former PM Sheik Hasina, so it might be arrested upon his return to the country. 
His lawyers have said that the court has refused to give its backing because of his indictment for having extracted from them to an individual businessman, 50 million Taka ($200 729.000,00) when she was PM. 
This case is one of the many accusations made to it. 
Khaleda Zia, a rival of always Sheik Hasina, was relaxée on bail earlier this month trickle-down economics. 
Sheik Hasina should return to the Bangladesh within a few weeks ago, but his party, the League Awani, has demanded that the country's interim military government gives him his first full freedom. 
Correspondents have pointed out that the terms of his release are contradictory because if we allow him to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why it should remain free on her return to Bangladesh. 
His lawyers have announced that it will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court. 
"The Supreme Court has rejected the request of Sheik Hasina saying that it does not require bail since it was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said his lawyer, Rafique ul Huq. 
"We will present an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court" 
His lawyers have argued that it needs this bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December 
Sheik Hasina should return after 17 October, said a former leader of the Awami Party. 
She was detained last year after the interim government has taken on military power, but was released in June for treatment abroad. 
Sheik Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, deny the accusations that they get.

BSkyB is losing the battle of ITV judicial 
BSkyB has lost its trial following the verdict of the Commission on Competition, which would compel it to reduce its participation in its provider rival ITV. 
The Court of appeal of Competition ordered to BSkyB to reduce its share of ITV of 17.9% to less than 7.5%. 
The committee has said that in the past, the participation of MSkyB had blocked competition and he was allowed to influence unfairly ITV. 
BSkyB has bought its share in 2006 following an agreement to prevent NTL, now known as Virgin Media, which buys ITV. 
In April 2007, the Bureau of Fair would have reported that the purchase by shares of BSkyB, ITV has cast doubt on the effective independence of ITV, incentive by consequence, the Commission to investigate Competition 
The boss of Virgin, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the regulator Ofcom were all contrary to the purchase. 
BSkyB explained that the force to reduce its share of ITV would not be reasonable and instead was excessive, particularly given that BSkyB has just abandon its voting rights. 
New investigation in the case of the US prosecutors. 
The lawyer American general has appointed a special accuser to examine the question of the dismissal of nine American prosecutors in 2006. 
The trick is born of the proceedings of the case of the inspector general of the Department of Justice, who criticised the actions of certain ministerial officers. 
The report was critical of officers of the White House, legislators and the former Prosecutor General, Alberto Gonzales. 
The investigation is based on the theory of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is to political causes. 
The accuser Spécial, Nora Dannehy now to investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation, have lied to the investigators, obstruant and justice. 
"Serious allegations of conduct potentially criminal, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said the Inspecteur General, Glenn Fine, in his report. 
The appointment of a special accusatory capable of forcing witnesses to table, was one of its most important recommendations. 
The dispute begins with the radiation in December 2006 of nine American prosecutors made by the US Department of Justice. 
At the time, the department said that prosecutors were laid off because of poor performance. 
But it emerged then, as prosecutors dismissed were not more criticism than their other colleagues, which incita some observers to give these redundancies a political connotation. 
Some prosecutors have been accused of being close to the Republicans in Congress, while others have refused to investigate the allegations of fraudulent vote against the Democrats. 
American prosecutors investigate and pursue the judicial authorities for the government. 
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but cannot be for political reasons. 
The head of the Department of Justice, Procurator General Alberto Gonzales, ends up accused of being involved in the case of dismissal, and in the end, he resigned. 
A number of ministerial officers at the Department of Justice have also given their resignation. 
The report of the Inspecteur General was very critical of the role of Mr. Gonzales in this case, saying that he considered "primarily responsible" for these redundancies, and ultimately "abdication" his leadership role, "skillfully managing not to have been involved in this. 
Other officers, including former assistant to Bush, Karl Rove, have been criticised for having failed to cooperate during the investigation. 
The saga of Meat Loaf will be kept. 
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honoured at Q Awards for his epic song Bat Out Of Hell. 
The singer, who will receive an oscar during the ceremony in London next week, said to be "honoured" to receive this recognition. 
The song nine minutes and 50 seconds, was the title of the hit of the Meat Loaf album in 1977. 
The evening of the award of the prize is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a selection restricted to four categories. 
Paul Rees, editor of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcends things as time and kind, and Bat Out Of Hell in fact certainly party ' 
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice as that of Meat Loaf. 
It begins with an instrumental section that has lasted almost two minutes. 
The song was put into trade in the United Kingdom, as single in 1979, is already the 15th place. 
Furthermore, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in the rankings English, and was sold to over 40 million copies worldwide. 
Meat Loaf - or Marvin Lee Aday, its true name - has suffered from health problems in recent years, suffering even an operation to cure her a heartbeat of heart became irregular, having collapsed on stage, in 2003. 
In 2007, a strong laryngite was forced to cancel concerts. 
Then he became a kyste in the vocal cords. 
A Sombre Rue in the City, Souvent Oubliée, and Peut Être Vente in Bientôt. 
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads parallel, some famous, others just functional. 
. And even some taxis veterans as well as local residents long-standing cannot give instructions to go to Extra Place, because they have never heard of. 
The street is in the East Village project and wanders the north of First Street - not to be confused with Second Street between Bowery and Second Avenue. 
About 30 feet wide for 120 long gone, it resembles a dusty rather than an active highway. 
. Some signs do not indicate the streets. 
It is virtually impossible to find on a standard atlas. 
This street, however, has admirers. 
For example, there are Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of the recent luxury buildings on First Street. 
He would like to repaver Extra Place, and create a more fluid passage into shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings. 
Other admirers including longstanding neighbours said to be charmés shortcuts that simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the houses there. 
But the Department of Immobilier preservation and development of the city, which administers the street, has no interest to keep. 
This month, at a meeting of the committees of the owners of neighbourhood, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay have drafted a proposal allowing the manufacturer to buy real estate. 
But the committee would prefer that the street remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to submit next month, said Susan Stetzer, the manager of the local n ° 3. 
"There are only few spaces belonging to the city, and we would like the city retains Extra Place" it says. 
"They could propose to rehabilitate it and deal with, what, moreover, Avalon could do, but we want to maintain public." 
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repaver small-scale street and installing seats, some are also used by a coffee that the manufacturer concédera space. 
The proposal of this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting this month. 
Michele de Milly, the door word of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to exploit the street, this does not necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner. 
"The main interest of Avalon Bay is relooker this been abandoned, and make it public," she said, stressing that this was the city to suggest selling. " 
Seth Donlin, a door floor of the preservation of the Immobilier, has confirmed that the city wanted well sell the streets, moreover, that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than dealing with it. 
Compared to its neighbour more colourful, Bowery, Extra Place has left a small historic footprint. 
Some believe that is called Plaza Extra since 1802, when the legacy of the great firm of many children of Philip Minthorne was split, leaving aside this small piece of land that remained since abandoned. 
Subsequent entry in a monument 17-year-old punk rock, CBGB closed in 2006, has re open to Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo at the cover of the album of Ramones, "rocket to Russia" 
"This place was wonderful," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, took the photo in November 1976. 
It was full of scrap, "barrique", haillons around, leaves and ropes. " 
Some residents, including the bloggeurs which had already talked about the evolution of the luxury of the East Village project, were opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public. 
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rarity - a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be rotten in peace. 
Named Jeremiah in Moss, who drives a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (sous-titré "the Book of Contestations: a Amèrement Regard Nostalgique on A City in the Kimberley Process of Extinction") described in the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker magazine. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small cul-de-sac narrow, dark day and night, and delimited by the doors of a warehouse and corroded iron persiennes, full of newspapers last week who are soaring along the gouttières." 
With few exceptions, the street was always the journey. 
A rat's short agilement at the bottom of the alleyway near a door who led once at CBGB, and which has now become the seat of a clothing store skinned. 
The graffiti on the walls, a bottle of beer to 22 onces empty, rests alongside newspapers that have just been cast. 
Some passers-by said they did not think that rarely to Extra Place, and suggested its emphasis. 
Mr. Field, for its part, said that some under felt the lure of the streets in its present state. 
"The best years of my life," he said, "were held in dark places, both wet and dégoûtants." 
The Debate Bilingue left in the English language. 
In this part of the programme of Supervision of education, Bruce Fuller and lance T. Izumi discuss the position of the candidates about bilingual education. 
Spear T. Izumi, a former member of the studies in California, and former director of the department of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the coauthor of the book "not as well as you do the Pensiez." 'why the middle classes should be able to choose their school. " 
Attract Hispanic voters is a complicated business. 
The proposals for Barack Obama on education are an interesting example. 
The campaign of Mr. Obama points out that "the Latino and African-American students less likely to diplômer that white students." this is true. 
To combat these differences, the education programme of Mr. Obama supports especially among so many other issues, "transitional bilingual education" for those learning English. 
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to carry out a bilingual education, which defends the instruction in class of languages other than English, is not only aimed to eliminate the differences. 
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern conté of Los Angeles. 
The students of this school are overwhelmingly Hispanic, and low incomes. 
More than a third of students, made up of many new arrivals, study English. 
Among the students of the CM1, 100% have passed the examination of state in 2008, maths expert level. 
Likewise, almost 93% of students have passed the examination of English language arts - - 
This unbelievable success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than that put forward by Mr. Obama. 
The Sixth Street, analyses of the practice, ongoing evaluation of capacities as well as an exemplary attitude. 
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reaps Linda Mikels, principal of the Sixth Street, this school has introduced the instruction of the English language "full immersion." 
The total immersion in English steadily focused on the use of English in the investigation. 
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, has asserted: "We have had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you were going without his class, you would have had no chance to identify." 
"It works, observed," does it worked for us. " 
Mr. Obama should he not give an example of the Sixth Street Prep and retaliate in other schools made up the majority of Hispanic students learning English. 
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for them even; but the policies on education within his party (the National Education for Associations have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, obscure the pronostique the response from Mr. Obama. 
Although he is in favour immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama recently considered this matter as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we all have to stop arguing about the wording of the laws in the English language. 
"On the contrary, he said," you must ensure that your child speaks Spanish. " 
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, it would then have to consider carefully the models of education that work, rather than the or dismissed as insignificant. 
Fall Nette entitled Inquiétudes Oil following the world of the Economy 
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday, because people fear that the rescue plan for the financial marches, will be able to breathe new life into the economy. 
The long-term operations of crude oil, fell by 7% arriving at 99.80 $200 a barrel, the New York Mercantile Exchange, during the sales this morning.

At the same time, the governments in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg have party nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis. 
Analysts from Barclays Capital said that the negotiations manic this week end, concluded with the agreement of rescue 'do not seem to have succeeded in reviving the market. " 
While the economic situation is détériorasse, demand for raw materials, oil included, should slow down. 
"The perspective of fairness in global interest rates and exchange markets has become uncertain," wrote analysts of Deutsche Bank in a letter to investors. " 
"We believe that the raw materials cannot escape this infection." 
"As far as the raw materials, our most pressing concerns is to understand how far the virus does US diffuserait overall and in particular, in China." 
The bank analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, given the fall in consumption of oil due to the slowdown in economic growth, were therefore forced to decrease of 20pour cent, forecasts of oil and gas prices for 2009. 
The celebration of the Second Chaplin's Déterminante for the improvement of Record of L'Ãquipe. 
After spending during the past eight seasons, more time than anyone in uniform the Jets Shaun Ellis, the defender thought had seen everything. 
He watched the second time, when the Jets transformèrent a 0 to 0 in an explosion. 
"I have never seen anything of this kind," said Ellis. 
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals have salement played under shady clouds. 
Then the quarter back Brett Favre has managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles from 12 yards for a touchdown, sign an afternoon during which their relationship has made a leap forward. 
Favre has found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner fell back and the second, 10 seconds of the half. 
"I am not out of my area," Favre said about all its narrows to Coles. 
"It is a mediocre player." 
"We can communicate extremely well, despite what the people say." 
While Favre and Coles played catch, defending the prior quarter back the Cardinals, Kurt Warner. 
Darrelle Revis, corner back, has intercepted an unrelenting lost and 32 yards until the touchdown. 
Eric Smith made another passes and was intercepted. 
Linebacker, David Bowens let slip the ball through Warner case. 
The last change, the loss of ball of Bowens, may well be the most charming 
The Cardinals have taken control of this possession during the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets have recovered the ball, Jay Feely made an example of 20 yards taking an advantage of 34 to 0. 
It was the best that the Jets were able to score at a time. 
"The coach of the Jets, Eric Mangini, who were asked to describe this madness, said" the second time or third? " 
When he said the two, the Jets have lost 21 points in the third time - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I have more appreciated the second time that the third." 
. "A lot of points were scored in a short space of time." 
Gebrselassie rested, exceeds his world record. 
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopia, again proved to be worthy of the title of best long-distance athlete of the century, having beaten his own world record in the marathon in Berlin Sunday, became the first to run 26,2 miles in less than 2heures and 4minutes. 
With a victory in 2: 03: 59 of a race accommodating on the flat, Gebrselassie was beaten by 27 seconds his record of 2: 04: 26, contended last year in Berlin. 
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career during which he has won the World Cup or the world record for any distance, 1600mètres the marathon. 
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - can be under control in the eyes of today - that air pollution is increasing its asthma. 
On the contrary, he promised to run in Berlin. 
In almost perfect - time sunny, 48 degrees at the start, 55 on arrival - Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds 
The trail runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyan, converted into runners, have contributed to the decrease in the record of the marathon of over two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2: 06: 05. 
After the victory Sunday, Gebrselassie said to reporters, have suffered crampes at mollet two weeks before, and have missed the training for a week. 
It is clear that the rest had been brilliant, but not corroded. 
"I am so glad," he said to reporters. 
"Everything is perfect." 
I have submitted last week, and today, I had my doubts, but in the end, it all went for the better. " 
He complained - especially in Kenya, the rival is of Africa, Ethiopia - having too orchestrate its stars, avoiding the racing world of marathon, relying on the hares as if they were in a competition of track, and looking the more world records that the direction of the competition. 
But the criticism does not reduce the greatness of the capacity for Gebrselassie as a long-distance athlete. 
Gebrselassie Sunday, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1: 02: 04. to middle path. 
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to defy Gebrselassie after the head of the queue were missing. 
A little more than three miles of the arrival, Gebrselassie has made its final push to let go of Kwambai, which ends up second in 2: 05: 36, improving his best record staff of five minutes. 
Kamathis is arrives third in 2: 07: 48. 
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, has completed a remarkable year obtaining the seventh time of 2: 19: 19. 
English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2: 15: 25. 
Last spring, Mikitenko aged 36 years ago, has surprised everyone winning the London an in 2: 24: 14. 
It could participate in the Beijing games because of a hypothetical badly at the back, but promised to win in Berlin, improving on his third marathon, his personal record of almost five minutes. 
It courut making use of a clever strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners take a tremendous advantage, exceeding then about 18miles 1/2 after. 
Askale Tafa Margasa Ethiopia came second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyane, ended third in 2: 25: 01. 
In a city halls to Part, the Orgueil and hardship of the Black Life 
Tucked away in the development of its vast park, just a few miles from the bright and sunny, the giant Orlando, lies a small quiet town, where are the pride and the complications of the experience afro-américaine. 
"Eatonville, first black to integrate fully town, house of Zora Neale Hurston childhood, this description she did in 1935, is no longer so easy to do nowadays." the city five lakes, three croquet, short of 300, foncées skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison. " 
Now it has become a pilgrimage city 
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Cinema every year to Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And in many ways, the city she described - has become a tourist thanks to its inclusion in the tour guide of the Florida published by The Depression era - Federal Writers Project ", remains a place apart. 
It is also independent, dignified, and private than it was already in the 1930s, when Hurston black told me that the rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share her real thoughts with the white man, who have so little, "we do not know what he loses." 
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, the Sénateur Barack Obama, who has also invoked an open dialogue on the issue of race, many people here remain wary of the view from abroad. 
"We are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59 years, resident for paroissienne still and the oldest of the city. 
"It must be in line with reality." 
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting. 
It is both a model history of a seizure of power of blacks as well as a community of almost 2 400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average. 
It is a central issue but also an example of black southerner rural culture - a few times ignored, other times hailed - which recalls the birth of American slavery. 
That was why the residents are both proud and protective. 
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston. 
It put forward his hometown to the world through books sincere, full of dialect, such as "mules and Men" (1935) and "their" Eyes Were Watching God "(1937)." 
Five paragraphs in the guide to Florida transformèrent this city, right on the exit of Route 17, a road which runs through the center of Florida, often forgotten, which in chapter in black history and the human tragedy. 
Bold such a big cash in life and in literature, Hurston led the readers to the shop of ownership of the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parties. 
"The road on the left," she writes, "you will find a modern public school brown and white, with its gardens and play areas well maintained that Howard Miller has always taken care of, well he can barely read and write." 
It did also mention the new husband Widow Dash and Glenn Lee wrote that "sells drinks of any kind and that everything that can be used to people." 
Therefore, in barely a hundred words, Hurston Eatonville combined in a government car but also to the analphabétisation, on remariage, and sex. 
Of course, Fodor was not the case. 
It was not in fact a portrait that everyone appreciates. 
Zora gave a good description of the reality, "said it Dinkins, 90 years, one of the girls to Johnson that Hurston was immortalised, citing the songs without color, interpreted by men who louaient their beauty." 
She added: "Some people have not appreciated." 
We remember always Hurston as a person live and eccentric, who was frequently after that his family has moved to Jacksonville, Fla. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, rappela that Hurston was usual in town without warning, on board of a big Chevy car, a cigarette in the mouth and was wearing the trousers here, where even today, we are proud of the traditional dress. 
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin reported, while many laughed. 
"People were always happy to see Zora" he said. 
But he adds, moreover, is balançant in his chair on the patio door post-Pinochet-era which gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly entitled, that "it was never too long." 
The death of Hurston in 1960, it was poor and his books were out production. 
Eatonville and the world seemed to have forgotten. 
Although she was once a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman from Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a grave, in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived. 
In Eatonville, no major commemoration, or plates for the general public. 
I do not think they understood the contribution or the legacy she offered to the world, "said Valérie Boyd, the author of" Wrapped in Rainbows, "a biography of Hurston published in 2003." 
A crucial time circumstances in the 1980s. 
Public officials of Orange County wanted to make a motorway to five routes in the city, to replace the main street, Kennedy Boulevard twin-track community. 
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 until the point west of the city. 
The proposal was made while Eatonville healed just a difficult period of its history. 
Forced integration, among many other things, put an end to the isolation relatively idyllic community. 
In the 1950s, the dispute about the mixing of races have led hatred at the gates of the community. 
"Then, as now, a gang of white youths were launch oranges or objects against the people who sit on the side of the road," said Mr. Franklin. 
"A woman is dead." 
They launched a pastèque of their car. " 
In a letter from 1955 to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston doubts the request to the Supreme Court for a forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v.. Board of Education "rather than glorifieuse insulting my race." 
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although in some positive aspects, has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and weakens the confidence of young people. 
"Black children had used to be embrassés - I recall - we embrace our master the morning and evening, too," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of it Dinkins and head as head of the Community of Sauvegarde Eatonville, a group not profit. 
It has taken, "it until the teachers and the students did no more of the same place. 
"You do not embrasses White professor tone because he is white - I want to say that there is a cultural dividing line," said Ms. Nathiri. 
Civil rights, moreover, have enabled us to create space for many other Zora Neale Hurston, black writers, actors and artists who went beyond the damage, as it, armed with a cheerful confidence own and lines of action such as: "How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company." 
It is beyond me. " 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker went on the grave anonymous Hurston and began to fight to revive his reputation. 
Five years later, a biography hailed on Hurston carried out by Robert E. Hemenway, a true best seller, the réintroduisit and cannons, American. 
The project of the motorway happened just when the daughter the most famous of Eatonville had regained its appeal. 
And this time, the old neighbours of Hurston view it as a sauveuse. 
The community has begun to organise a festival Hurston to demonstrate the disastrous consequences that would create the motorway. 
Hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years later, and many back in January, to commemorate her. 
After many years, the contée rejected the proposal of the motorway. 
"The fiasco of the motorway to five channels, extremely fast, a genuine civic pride," said Ms.. Nathiri. 
Ms. Boyd summed up everything that "Zora has saved Eatonville." 
The victory against the project of the motorway has allowed him to change his own image. 
Of those, such as non-resident Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who frequent our church depuis1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past. 
Eatonville is classified historic city since 1998. 
A library mono subject (famous, of course, Hurston) ouvra in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repavé. 
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time see themselves as a back street in a subsequent summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1800's. 
(We now 90%) 
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its raison d'Ãªtre, are still treated with caution. 
We must ask permission for most of the interviews, and some things, like the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, of why black men in the fields - must not be photographed. 
A lot of Eatonville, as Miss Jones, a female teacher courageous and which has a low for the red heart, are still afraid that their island community is understood. 
However, given the expansion of the festival Hurston, a certain level of local pride has emerged. 
Young people in particular, tend to view Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and all, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, bosseuse insane and seen as the other racial and ethnic groups in America. 
It is the civic sincere affection in the voice of the nephew of Mr. Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after the college to work for the local government or to the forces of Police, who need additional forces. 
And even for the youngest, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11ans, twins in Winter Park, seem to have learned well the description Eatonville. 
"Most people, who are in this area here, will think," oh, this city has nothing compared to other 'Alondra Kenon said after church on Sunday. 
But if you stop and take the time to look at the history, this is a very beautiful city. " 
Here in New York, all speak fluently finance. 
Despite everything, nothing has changed. 
If tourists in Manhattan took place far from the newspaper stand and giant television screens in Times Square, they do not make that they are in the eye of the typhoon. 
Never thinking that they could not in the offices in glass and nest of bees on top of their tète, bankers and hedge fund managers who dominate New York, are the worst "working day at the office" since the fall of 1929. 
The men continue to slip on the streets, with their trolleys and their shelves of muffins for the meetings matinières. 
The Latino drag still between the residential blocks relating, as mules, some 50 shirts glossy hanged a yoke prepared on its shoulders. 
The office still queuing to buy their sandwich matinier the itinerant traders, and it is impossible to find a taxi between 16h and 19h last week. 
I had not felt the crisis despite the stories completely pessimistic until this afternoon when I décidai to open a new account of savings. 
Fortunately, I had planned to work at the end of the afternoon, because I découvrais to my local JP Morgan Chase, a score of people queuing. 
Not before the counters of cashiers, or to withdraw the case or make a payment, but before the window of customer service, where the usual customers where their checkbooks, tourists demanded the direction for the store Macy, and new customers opened accounts. 
Most of those in front of me, I apprendrais later by Starr, my "banker" authorized personnel, were all in line for the same reason than me. 
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their economies of smaller banks, such as those of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island. 
They have withdrawn their money in savings accounts known as thrifts such a building society (credit), associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that will only work within a state, and who say they treat customers as their families. 
In a recent past, 15 of these banks went bankrupt. 
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank in the capital of 327 $200 has used syndic bankruptcy, and while the New Yorkers returned to their home for the week ending this Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, the savings accounts with a value of 440 $200 million, désespéramment sought a buyer for the save. 
The office and employees of shops that are in front of me, afraid of another potential debacle, have transferred money to a bank which they believe is reliable, is the one who made the most of the rescue on Wall Street. 
Of some New Yorkers have become very familiar to the world of finance in recent weeks. 
"I heard a lady in my local supermarket Chinese, talk on the phone from Lehman Brothers, the bank which has gone bankrupt, and its meager Director-General Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity that it could have to criticize a colleague." 
And Lyn, the uniformed doorman in my apartment building, has changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my fruit and vegetables. 
She said to me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the money market funds." 
"I have changed, I do not want to take that risk." 
Muslim graves desecrated while Austria has swung to the right. 
- Heinz Christian Strache, who gave up the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang, are taking part in a demonstration to present the organisation "cities against the Islamisation 'in Antwerp, on Thursday, 17 January 2008. 
They wear road signs of mosques wiped out in red. 
The Police accuses the right-wing extremists have desecrated a Muslim cemetery Austrian, the week ending of the victory of the political parties of the extreme right wing in the general elections of the country. 
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the cemetery of Traun, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning, according to the police, an organized action. 
Criminals have painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the incident of David, the detectives believe however that this could have been done to dress the feeling of hatred towards the extremist Muslim immigrants. 
This accident could be somewhat related to the elections. 
A door floor of the local Community Islamic said to be "profoundly shocked" to hear of this desecration, which comes just religious for the month of Ramadan which is coming to an end. 
Austria think seriously to rediscover her courage, following his oscillation to the right in the parliamentary elections yesterday. 
The two right-wing parties that have raflé almost 30% of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led a campaign anti- immigration. some of their slogans were even seen, according to the criticism, as xenophobic. 
- Heinz Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party won more than 18% of the votes, has conducted his campaign against the wearing of headscarves and under burkas, and has even expressed its opposition to the food alaha. 
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam. 
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, saying that they would be a political symbol of the Islamisation of Austria and Europe. 
Opinion polls and analyses carried out just after the elections, have defined the extreme right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because worried about their future in the European Union. 
Gary Glitter forbidden to travel abroad. 
The courts have banned rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuse of children, to cross in Spain and France. 
The Glitter to both sexes have imposed a ban of six months, after he had expressed to the authorities who have under control, his intention to go to Spain via France.

"I photograph the master out of the limelight for catching elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographe 
Neither they nor transgressing clothes. 
The essence of the great masters of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco, freed of all tensions to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or a woman. 
On the one hand, the artist. 
On the other hand, the person. 
Inseparable, except in intimacy, in these times, unknown to the general public, where we come to gaze and intimate gestures stolen artists who care not to climb on to the scene. 
German Günther Bauer mixture in "intoxicating spirit of flamenco - people 'the théâtralité some put on stage with singers, dancers and guitaristes with this side lesser known artists. 
In this project, the photographer incorporates the iconography of special intoxicating spirit of flamenco from different angles. 
Included in the programming of the Mois de la Photographie Fleming, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco, greater every day," explains the creator, explaining that "intoxicating spirit of flamenco - people '" can be anybody but, having seen the pictures, the observer realizes that this is not a typical images of artists on stage. " 
These people photographiées'in the street'artists are able to transmit on stage of the passion, the sadness, joy... in riveting the public. 
To capture the moments of personality of these artists we must not make photos on the scene. 
They have a personality and character of its own. 
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere to be able to capture with the camera of moments of personality of the stars of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco. " 
With the popular song 'festival of Mines, "Bauer started in 1997 a long journey for the guitaristes or nullified, the dancers with a camera to mark. 
These are the portraits who, thanks to the choice of the camera and hardware, listened to the classic photograph. 
The implementation of various means stylistic breaks with the side of the traditional image, with a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco according to Bauer: "A very roots music with traditional changing and which surprises every day." 
This is not the dance or the song itself, but the personality and character of the artist who ogre the public with his art. 
Research is essential and the magic has been the constant of this work is being presented now to the gallery El Fotómata. 
The stars of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from approximately 70 artists photographed. 
The project has been a pick of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book gathering portraits exposed to the gallery.

Although the concepts are different in "intoxicating spirit of flamenco - people ', the photographer admits that he loves photographing the portrait of people know and be able to enter their lives for a moment more or less long. 
I believe that in the photograph the portrait is the kind most difficult. 
You go trouves in front of people, characters that sometimes you do not know or who you leave only a few minutes to be able to do a photo. 
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try my ideas reality. " 
This collection of portraits of the current intoxicating spirit of flamenco entitled "intoxicating spirit of flamenco - people ', is exposed to 40 El Fotómata, located at number 20 on the streets of the Mata (street parallel to the Peupleraie of Hercules) which will be open until 16 October.

Llamazares called the Andalusian federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the case Silva 
The coordinator general and member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former adviser of Youth and Sport of the Municipalité from Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of carrying out the treatment to the members of his family. 
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and this will be the Andalusian organisation which must assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the conduct of the political party that he will adopt in the city council in Seville. 
However, the leader of the United Left has called for the investigations show "transparency" to the irregularities that Silva could commit, "the United Left has always defended this kind of business so that they have an extremely high degree of transparency."

"Sangre de Mayo ', the gamble dared to Garci" 
Drawing on the accounts of whether you are talking about our Benito Perez Galdós, José Luis Garci récrée the famous battle of Spaniards against the French in "sangre de mayo," which is the most ambitious film of his filmographie with nearly 15 million euros of budget. " 
The filmmaker has tried to put on the many characters and to illustrate the social analysis "he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of players. 
The film for a period of more than two and a half, "sangre de mayo" will make his release in cinemas next Friday, which will become later a Telemadrid television series for more than four hours. " 
Great admirer of literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci guarantees to have done with this film "a dream of child" through Esperanza Aguirre, who was responsible, three years ago, to turn a commemorative film for two hundred years of 2 May Madrid, something he has always accepted when the story is up to the national historical facts. 
The 15 million provided by the Commune of Madrid are for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the settings and clothes appropriate the mood of "a Spain which has mistaken her head for the fight, because the fight for independence has led the people to rebellion under the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said. 
But the filmmaker regret not having obtained funding for films such as "captain Alatriste" or "the ghosts of Goya's" - more than double that achieved for "sangre de mayo" - because it was unable to turn a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has worked for almost his entire career. " 
The filmmaker of "Volver" empezar has influenced its usual way of working, on the direction of the players, with whom he used to say before starting the film and that there is no casting but because it seems "humiliating" and believes that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theatre and cinema to be informed." 
A lot of actors in "sangre de mayo" rehearsed before the camera, as Miguel Rellán, Carlos LarraÃ±aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. 
Four times a candidate Oscar (he won a), Garci believes that the three films candidates who represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood, "sangre de mayo," "seven French ping pong tables" and finally the winner, "the tournesols blind", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which should be better known," he said. " 
With this film Garci does not expect a price. 
"At the beginning you think you travailles for posterity, and then do you realise that you travailles for prosperity, and now you go only to make a film in more," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional careers. 
Isabelle Bayón puts itself in the skin of the young girl's fancy sévillane Tórtola Valencia 
A young girl's fancy sévillane will pay tribute to a young girl's fancy also sévillane. 
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a father Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and of a mother Georgina Valencia Andalusian (Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana and who at the age of three years will go live in London with his family. 
It was a young girl's fancy dance free dancing and specialist in eastern. 
It was an exciting life, a pioneer of the release of the woman, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
It was a Buddhist and vegetarian and plaida for the abolition of the corset which forbade the free movement of women. 
The life of this woman who marked the history of the interwar dance in Europe, has fascinated Isabelle Bayón. 
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the Commission has proposed to interpret the young girl's fancy sévillane Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible." 
The young girl's fancy, "we are not trying to tell his life but to translate its way of thinking." 
The titles of his dancing made me think of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco. 
Thus, "the Dance of the moth" reminded me of a Cuban folk dancing and "dance of the snake 'to some tangos. 
Its sensuous dancing was and they told me that my way of dance was similar to hers, "she says." 
The dramatization was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who chantera Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done to "the puerta abierta"; and that of the professor Matilde Coral, who has exceptionally well liked to work with the one that was his pupil. 
"Tórtola Matilde transforms into a mature person." 
I am happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and that I feel honoured. " 
There is also thanks to music composition and the guitares of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi of Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the violates Rafa El Viola and the cooperation of a player, Juanfra Juárez, "which plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were regarded as divas." 
The play tells also to a certain extent, the life of this woman who has shown artfully in places so distant, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or in Russia, but also in Europe, since it was usually in London. 
"I wanted the back because I think it is these women who have a huge influence in their time, and now nobody knows and highlights his work," says Bayón. 
The show starts at 8.30pm at the theatre Lope de Vega 
The publication of the "newspaper of a poet recently married," concludes the Triennat 
The presentation of the first edition illustrated the "newspaper of a Poète recently married" in the Church St. Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez was married with Zenobia in March 1916, falls within the framework of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006, 2008), held to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the concession of the Nobel Littérature and their deaths. 
In this way, "triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" is coming to its end with the revival of the play, with the Congress International which took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the exhibition migrant "Juan Ramón Jiménez: this peuplier of light", which was inaugurated in May last year and who, having travelled in the various provinces of Andalusia, will go to New York in the Congress International. 
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia has bought eight hundred copies of "newspaper of a poet recently married," edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez - Enciso, to continue the work of one of the best-known Andalusian poets. 
America wants less without Paul Newman 
"The time God creates perfect people." 
Paul Newman was part of that. " 
This sentence is the actress Sally Field, who has worked with him in "the absence of malice," and illustrates the desperation of American cinema, and the whole of America, in the face of the idea striking that Newman is no longer in this world. 
He found it difficult to get an Oscar 
It was more since 2007. 
Everyone knew that he was ill. 
It was a hard blow for everyone. 
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," began crying Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to its existence." 
No one was afraid to make itself ridiculous or exaggerate. 
One of the fathers of cinema and the homeland died during a particularly obscure, where terrorists and stock markets are scared, believe the US is low, desperately searching for reasons of dignity. 
When times are so hard and without reason to live, there are the human beings that admiration and there is no need to be Luis Cernuda for love Paul Newman. 
It was for all the world an ideal of beauty and truth. 
It was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender lost causes and defeated, as the foundation for the anti-drugs battle, created in honour of his mother died following an overdose and creating its own brand of organic food. 
It was a victory for a country that has been difficult to impose itself against a suicidal food culture. 
This expansive wave of admiration balayait Hollywood without addressing nor the nationalities or passports. 
The latest James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that no James Bond died before him. 
Another Englishman, at Sam Mendes, said that work with Newman marked the peak of his career. 
The bad boy arrived in Australia, Russell Crowe, dared appoint Newman as his greatest inspiration. 
"We have set the bar high," said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only today who tries to break the screen like Paul Newman: by being very honnêt and private life with a serious and far short of the objectives. 
This is still not easy or possible in the jungle media these days. 
But there is the one who tries, and Paul Newman is one example. 
After a divorce, he has been married 50 years to Joanne Woodward were to which it has been true even if the opportunities was ample reason for him not to be. 
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my home, if I have a beef steak in my fridge?", he used to joke. 
Goodness witness with pride to the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America. 
"Among all the major roles he has interpreted, it has never been more proud than proud of her husband, father, grandfather attentionné and philanthropist," said he. 
Madrid in the race for the organisation of the Olympic Games in 2016 
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid could organize the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it might be in 2016. 
But I wonder whether we are ready. 
If we take the example of the race yesterday: we are not! 
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race to which I have never participated. 
If they had taken into account all the mistakes that occurred during the race, it would be a note éliminatoire. 
But look at everything in detail and from the start. 
The errors are starting with the withdrawal of dossards, which you have to go there in advance. 
This is not bad but if they make you move that would be better that they give you everything (including the electronic chip for racing). 
It isn't 
They were you go there just to take the dossard (first mistake, travel only for this) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there is only the size "is for the jersey (second mistake, because I need a size XL) 
What kind of world we live in? 
Is it because of the crisis they have decided to buy shirts that small with fewer fabric and suddenly cheaper? 
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of racing. 
Apart from the fact that we must go there very soon to withdraw the chip, the queue is 15 minutes and he must leave his rucksack in. 
The debate has lasted more than 35 minutes, it is incomprehensible given that 11, 000 people are expected for these races. 
Since there has had a long queue, competitions have started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse. 
In addition, the rain accompanied the expectation of more than 40 minutes during which have taken place rebellion and assault of baraque. 
I believe that around 500 people have pneumonia tomorrow, and people like myself, do not even in the figurerons classification with the exact time, because of the chip that they gave me, which I think has not been properly at the outset. 
Of course, if they were asking me to give you an example of a race I ever perfect, it is above all not to the idea. 
And I believe that we can always dream to become the host city for the 2016 or government. 
While Microsoft seeks a (virtual) 
At the conference on the Émergentes Technologies MIT Microsoft was presented a new system for the recognition of human interaction and image, a sort of Intelligence Artificielle with little intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as call a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to roam the campus of the company) in response to what he was asked during a conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "while" can know how many people there are in place, which they are - including remember what positions they occupy, and listen and hear the key words from their conversations. 
But also the group together according to groups of conversation 
In the video presentation, while detects a third person but it understands that it is not up to the group which is dealing with it and that it is not part of the company. 
She asks him if she is here to visit someone and she said she will reply in a few moments. 
All this without blue screen. 
Impressive. 
But of course this is the future. 
Now the company has other things on which to focus, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows. 
This week we spoke in more than a change of strategy at Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many programmes associated. 
Steve Ballmer, has discovered that if the computers were sold with the essential instead of unnecessary applications, they would five times faster. 
This is a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not ceased to added functions and "extras" to Windows. 
The change of strategy is welcome. 
Microsoft is right, its operating system is important but also its software. 
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on the part of Google to compete with Windows. 
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not a workable system. 
The system operational will always be necessary because it is the vital foundation for the hardware and the software will understand. 
It occupies the same function that your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law. 
That is true. 
It will never be closed but we need to see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a truth. 
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea. 
People are less and less attention to the system operational but increasingly to the Internet browser. 
We turn on the computer, only to turn, Explorer or Firefox Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than to go down the drain. 
To which serve half of the applications submitted with the system? 
Who can do more is less. 
And Windows 7 must contain fewer applications, much less that Vista. 
Crowded month, less costly, less complex. 
For now, Microsoft is more interested in the launch of its own online services so that they will finally become an alternative to Google. 
They desperately need it, indeed, and I would show an example. 
The photograph presents in this article, was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for employees of Microsoft in Redmond. 
On the distributor of drinks, a poster ask them to use their own research tool, "your research." our future. " 
In 2006, a study found that 66% of employees of Microsoft used Google to seek information on the Internet. 
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
It will not emerge at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010. 
Microsoft will surely to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7. 
The telephone, after all, increasingly resembling a computer. 
But the launch of Android being delayed and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dearly. 
The Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso the assumed on the Cote d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio bore a Diamant "in the blood" of Edward Zwick, along with Al Pacino in "Le Parrain" of Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the holding of the association gays heavy-handed. 
And if we are to list all of his appearances, one could also mention that costaud which raise moustachu ambulant weight in a circus. 
This is not just a simple jersey in male body in cotton, milling and without sleeves up. 
The English call "tank" but the Fabuleux Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others. 
Firstly, by its name flamboyant - although he is known as "Marcel" - which has to do with sport since it takes the name, according to the legend, the boxeur Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf. 
The "Marcel" differs from the other by its cotton excellent, by its thumb single-sex, with its distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag (barely recognisable) that the best-known body shirts have in the neck. 
But be careful, because the Belgian mark does not just that of tank tops. 
But it also produces sweat-shirt, boxers, rétro cashmere cardigans and trousers in cotton, babies, mini-shorts... 
Clothes designed for the comfort of his underwear. 
Even though it is unfortunate to be just as underwear. 
They have too much charm. 
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate does not worry me." 
Its huge resemblance to his sister has not prevented to develop its own personality. 
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality. 
Currently the sisters Cruz take seriously their new activity in the fashion. 
According to Monica, they are not that famous and beautiful girls who are devoting their name. 
She was present at the promotion that trademark Mango was in Paris to its new headquarters but as well as to the presentation of the most important price of fashion house that the Spanish sponsoring. 
Monica is warm and timid. 
Tell us what you do in Paris. 
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I even have created for the new season for Mango automne-hiver, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of "Mango Fashion Awards" and the Opera dinner in honour of Valentino. 
A day very intense but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us. 
Based on what your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season? 
The cinema of the 1950s and 1960s we recall and we copy a lot to our collections. 
I very much like to walk in the city and see women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do. 
Young girl's fancy, actress and dessinatrice, you are a woman very versatile: is it not? 
I think yes but in the end everything is joined and these activities have much in common. 
Since I am tiny clothes plaisaient me; I désirai go to my grandmother to look in the filing of my aunt who and to see his clothes. 
It was a genius and is almost better than to go to the theme park. 
Then, when I became a young girl's fancy, I was trying always to take care of my way to dress up. 
The dancers like a lot of dress for the courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good. 
And in the role of actress, when you endosses clothing that is when you go really in the skin of the character. 
Suddenly, everything is connected. 
You have had in 30 years: was it hard for you? 
Not at all. 
I feel better than ever, my 30 years is a blessing. 
I think that the woman is more mature, has more experience and appreciate life with fewer problems. 
The biological clock me no fear. 
I have done all the things that I wanted to do since very small and it gave me a lot of happiness. 
So, you think you become mother? 
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body wonder and, furthermore, I want to become a young mother; I don't want to lose that. 
With regard to the candidate, I don't worry. 
What I will do that is to give much happiness for my son and to raise it with a lot of love. 
Turning to the cinema, you expect the various films that you turned last year. 
It is true, I am keen that they come from. 
I am a woman from the theatre, I am very anxious and concerned, I would like to have everything now, but of course it is not possible. 
I look forward to that extent the films "The última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo." 
To see what you think... 
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, is it not? 
Do not say that. 
I am not carried on the bridge to the mannequin. 
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I have known her for quite some time, to invite me to participate in London a parade of charity for his association to support women and clothes that we exhibions - I have exhibited two clothing of our collection created for Mango - were sold at auction to collect money for the NGOs of Naomi. 
The people that Naomi is a person at heart strive. 
They say so much about it, I do know, a lot of things are not true. 
Moreover, if good side of Naomi fascinates me. 
She has asked me to go up for a cause so noble, but if I had been asked to do the poirier, I would have done anyway. 
It is important to make life better for women in the developing world. 
Repeat offenders of drink-driving will install the system "alcolock" 
The interior minister wants the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcohol in the blood, has to install in his vehicle a system that makes it impossible to start the vehicle when drunk, or if it does not. 
The initiative was already announced in June last year and it now appears in the report by the Minister of State in which this initiative is regarded as a pilot project that will last a year. 
Its purpose is the rehabilitation of the driver on road rehabilitation courses. 
The Minister of State in charge of road safety but also the Directorate General of Security Routière Technologique Institute and the Foundation for Security of the car will participate in this initiative. 
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for having led more than once when drunk, takes up the car. 
The alcolock would avoid it because it is a phone system on the vehicle, which measure the level of alcohol in the breath and prevents to start the vehicle when the driver does not before; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than that allowed. 
Its cost is higher than 1,000 euros and is the responsibility of the driver. 
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with this system were driving up to 65% of offences during the first year of installation. 
And in Spain we believe that this could save the lives of 115 people each year. 
This measure is that administrative sanctions for two reasons: to do against them before they become criminal offences. 
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be made by ordinary channels but, however, the reform made by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law. 
The facility is not yet available on the market in Spain in any form, although some commercial and industrial vehicles already has an office in experiments. 
Precisely tomorrow, the Members of Congress will vote an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party, which proposes to set up this system in the school bus as has happened in France. 
In Mexico without "peep toes." 
At 5 40pm precise, official time planned, the Spanish air force plane in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling in the atterrissait Presidential Hangar airport whether you are talking about our Benito Juárez Mexico DF. 
The sun was on the eve of lying down, but its shelves force still to trap by way of visière in order to be able to see the royal couple descend from the plane. 
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present. 
A few hours ago I asked in the streets, the taxi driver, if he was aware that the Princes Spanish were visiting the city to complete their journey official. 
- Ah, well, we cannot go to the airport to take customers to this time... are you here and then...? 
No, no sir, I am Spanish but I have lived here thinking two years ago. 
- Ah, well... 
But the Mexican press knows very well who are the Princes of Asturias and knows the importance of the trip. 
They are several to wait in the warehouse at the airport near the red carpet and a row of military composed of 27 soldiers of navy. 
Prince is smiling and wearing a fireman's of marine blue, Princess, when to it, has the hair in the wind, is the one dressed very soberly recognized and is not its "usual" - peep toes; maybe they had said that a storm. 
They make a brief stop with the photographers before moving into the room where the trail official backing. 
At the door of the hotel where they remain, one of the four largest hotels of the city, a journalist rigolo Mexican television awaits them. 
The price the most prestigious fashion 
There is certainly no appropriate place in the world to present a price of fashion that Paris and there is certainly no dessinateur living more extraordinary and good live that Valentino. 
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón - Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of the new talents of fashion. 
The winner will be awarded a prize of 300,000 euros. 
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli exit Belgian, the winner of the first edition, watched its models in the window of Mango at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris, and she began crying almost emotion. 
Of course it is the second largest shop of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1.335 square metres of the surface.

It is not Inés Sastre remained for the visit of the dependence of the palace, but it has exposed before on his cell phone photos of her son. 
The next morning, we had the pleasure to see Mr. Martínez - another good man who drives a motorcycle, and John Travolta, who came to the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with its awful mess, its chaff and having asked beforehand, that there was no smell in his chamber. 
Stars under the starry sky of Paris. 
Oh, that's life.

Speaking in sleeping 
A few children talk through the night. 
I refer to those who are waking up to very awake in this "something happened the day before, but the children who speak during their sleep. 
The first time this happens, it may surprise you, but in reality it does not matter. 
It is a benign alteration of sleep known somniloquie. 
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents. 
It is true that there are more than one who speaks through the night. 
This phenomenon may appear very sporadic (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever), or more regular (every day, once a week, once a month...), the day after the child does not remember anything any more. 
There is no single cause which determines its appearance 
They are often linked to other alterations of sleep as the nightmares, the énurésies night terrors, bed at night (do) or the pipi sleepwalking, but it is not always the case. 
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very high found in situations of stress or agitated. 
In any case this is a phenomenon extensively studied. 
The intensity with which it happens is also very variable. 
It may be that he speaks with a small voice calm, with isolated words, noises or instead with shouts, tears, long speeches... 
In the case where the somniloquie becomes very frequent, it would be good to see the child and expert advice, to check whether there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to get an explanation to this problem. 
We said that this is a benign, that is why there is no treatment, unless it is linked to another alteration of sleep that can be treated (for example, if it is linked to a apnée of stress or sleep). 
What we can do is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures, such as: 
Try not to stir up the child before you go to sleep. 
Therefore seek quiet games and avoid programmes or of television series that are more or less violent. 
With children very nervous and who have difficulty relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help calm down internally. 
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep. 
As soon as the somniloquies appear, are trying to remain calm. 
Let me remind you that they are harmless to the child and the next day he will be remembered more for what happened. 
Good advice 
Do not wake up. 
It is useless because it is unconscious and you réveilleriez. 
Even though he speaks, he is sleeping and therefore assumes. 
Let me remind you that it is very anguished several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or to check what causes so much anxiety in children. 
If you understand what he said (which is not normal), do not be tempted to query it to obtain information. 
You will achieve nothing, because in sleeping, he is not aware to organize its thinking. 
In addition, you will hear what he said, but you will not know what it is in the process of dream, suddenly made careful in the way in which you interpréterez information and the conclusions you draw from this. 
Never say no to the child that you can ask him during the night to hear what their secret. 
Not even inform. 
This causes much anxiety. 
In conclusion, do not worry, this is not something to be bad, it is an episode which lasts only a few minutes. 
Finally, Illhaeusern... 
Has finally returned Illhaeusern victory at home after a long period of food shortages. 
Without making a big match, the Jaunes and blacks have created the largest number of occasions and managed to turn a match for the excess. 
The pace was not very supported during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty speaking. 
After a first attempt by the captain visitor Kauffmann who frôlait the lucarne on an unrelenting far, Illhaeusern slightly would take precedence and in turn Fonderflick far, then with Hirn above, Roman, the end of the foot or Diebold came tickle the defence of Dannemarie. 
In the face, it was a block in the middle of ground and it was just the great Riahi at the forefront of the attack. 
The start of second half would be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens by Marais, well positioned to pick up a ball back on a first attempt at Diebold (53rd). " 
But the buteur Illhousiens cannot enjoy happiness long and will be forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later and leaving its coéquipiers in numerical inferiority. 
But Dannemarie will not benefit and will not pose major problems to an 11 illhousien which has just fallen a bit for 'compacter "defense, except in the last few seconds of game when, after a great example, the ball was very nearly across the board. 
Sarkozy to the meeting of the fishermen angry 
Before running for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is going to make a detour via Brittany. 
Faced with the demonstration of force by the fishermen who have severely disrupted Monday the access of several ports in Brittany and Normandy, the President of the Republic has decided to go Tuesday morning at the port of Guilvinec, in the common ground, to meet with their representatives. 
They have promised to accommodate him "in a constructive spirit" and "hope he will come up with concrete proposals." 
A presidential visit comes at the same time quune general assembly of the "crisis committee" introduced by fishermen in Brittany to obtain measures in the face of soaring oil prices, which reached a record of more than 1.14 euro per litre on average.

The port craft of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle - island not stopped. 
A dam image has been getting underway on the island of Quiberon. 
The seamen have already shown their determination by burning on Monday, right from the beginning, tyres and fuel depots pellets in the port of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations have been taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc. 
The movement has spread to other ports on the Atlantic coastline and the Channel, as the Sables to Olonne, the Vendée, where trawlers remained idle, or in Le Havre, where two dozen boats have blocked the movement of vessels. 
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, Loire-Atlantique regions, have stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Total refinery at Donges. 
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait for the holding of the Wednesday meeting at the Ministry to decide on any action. 
The Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must indeed decide Tuesday on follow-up to the movement and its participation in lentrevue scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris. 
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by leaders of the National Committee of peaches, which did not support their movement. 
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen do keep anything" and "do not want to travel to Paris" has, for example, announced Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries of Lorient. 
The professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel fuel, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre but they believe that the threshold for the profitability of a ship is achieved with a less than diesel 0.30 euros a litre.

By 228 votes to 205 for, the representatives have refused to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's means that he was asking for. 
Almost two out of three Republicans have rejected his plan. 
"This is a bad signal to the market, which sees the Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial. 
"It shows how the market relied on this plan," she added, fearing that a draft adopted in several days is "too late". 
"If the project is effectively moribund (...) then the baton is passed quickly to the Fed (US central bank, ndlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which resserrerait more credit conditions, said Brian Bethune, Chief Economist at Global Insight.

Obama, winner of the points of the first televised duel 
In the first debate for Friday between the two candidates for the White House has followed another to know who John McCain or Obama, has prevailed. 
Not surprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters have proclaimed their own victory in this television duel that would have been followed by a third of American families. 
Political analyst David Gergen believes that the provision of John McCain, although honourable, has not been sufficiently "brilliant" in order for it to halt its decline in the polls five weeks of the presidential elections. 
The Gallup Institute, an opinion poll published Saturday gives a lead of five points to Obama (49% against 44 percent for McCain), thinks this is the democrat who has drawn its own way. 
Among the undecided voters, who are those that count, Obama emerged a winner for 39 percent of those questioned, while 25% of them are giving the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll. 
Obama should be able to confirm its advance Thursday with the good performance expected of his colistier, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Palin. 
"It would be a mistake to underestimate." 
It is has good instincts, "has, however, warned Bill Clinton this weekend." 
The septuagénaire McCain has repeatedly put forward its unquestionable experience in foreign policy, while underlining the "naivety" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face. 
"Senator Obama appears not to understand that..." he accused has several times. 
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has experience and expertise needed to be president," he also assured. 
A line of attack opposition since yesterday in the Republican television advertisements. 
Obama has, he pointed out that it represented the future. 
Without changes, he has been concise and precise. 
He has highlighted his ability to take the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world. 
"McCain has still not understood, while Obama, if", retorted, this weekend, a Democratic Regulation accusing the Republican of not having grasped the impact of the crisis on the US "in the street." 
"During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing on you, denounced Obama, yesterday, in 20 000 personnesrassemblées for an election rally in North Caroline in a rain battante." 
He did not even used the words "middle class" or "workers". the rout financial advantage clearly Obama, who is considered by the Americans as the most able to save the economy to the brink of disaster. " 
"The coming week could be a turning point", estimated yesterday, the influential Democrat Senator Charles Schumer. 
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former of the Clinton administration, has compared the "good" economic instincts born to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis. 
For the Democratic candidate, the current débacle "is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain." 
Reaffirming that it would nevertheless to reduce taxes to 95% of Americans despite the unpredictability of Wall Street, Senator of Illinois has also pointed out that the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country by the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a system on health insurance. 
McCain, however, wanted to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power stations by 2030. 
Careful, both candidates have ducked questions relating to the bailout of 700 billion dollars (470 billion) adopted last night by the Congress and extremely unpopular. 
In Minsk, "you have noticed that there was an election, you?" 
Young and opponents are demonstrating Sunday evening on the main square of the capital of Belarus to reject in advance of the elections. 
A few hundred of Belarussians gathered Sunday evening at the polling stations closed in the central square in Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation. 
While no results had been announced, many young people were came to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "The dictator, resignation." 
Some have not even voted openly declared: "What good, since they will be what they want for my voice," said a young man. 
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good impression to foreign observers in order to resume talks with the European Union is prepared to make a democratic watershed. 
The sanctions, which ban on visas for 40 Belorussian leaders and the freezing of some assets, could be lifted if the elections were seen as own observers. 
They were not according to the opposition. 
"We have been excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to take part in the count", has deplored Iouri Potemkin, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of 12 parties. 
"It is a cosmetic change, underlines Mr. Alexander Milinkevich, a former opposition candidate in the presidential elections of 2006 and leader of pro-European, because it is important that counts the votes, and among us, it is the executive." 
If Members of the opposition enter the parliament is that they have been appointed, not elected. 
But their entry to the parliament can mean for space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals of laws. " 
The opposition must therefore become involved in the political game because "we must begin a dialogue with the European Union." 
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt to Russia, is in crisis, and that we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia. 
But we want to be independent. " 
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe which followed the election process do not recognize the validity of the election. 
It stresses that the turnout figures seem too high, and that the increase in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all the manipulations. 
"You have noticed that there was an election, you? asked the Social Democratic leader Alexander Kazulin, one of the last two political prisoners freed in August this year." 
There was no one in the polling stations. 
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition in the parliament, those best suited to the power. " 
The silence of the night falls on the place of October. 
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the central electoral commission are pleased with their success. 
The meeting - Du blood become course 
Héma - Quebec yesterday was the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its chairman, the Décary Francine Dre, had reason to celebrate, because Héma - Quebec has become one of the most blood suppliers of security and efficient in the world. 
And, above all, he has regained the confidence of the public who had been seriously damaged by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s. 
As you know, the reserves managed by the national blood transfusion service of the Canadian Red Cross have been infected by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s. 
Before this tragedy and resentment of the public, the government of Canada has set up in February 1994, a public inquiry, headed by Judge giant Krever inquiry, which sought to shed light on the circumstances that led to this tragedy and to make recommendations for just such a disaster never happens again. 
While the judge Krever tardait to submit his report, some provinces have set up a committee to plan a new system of management of blood in Canada. 
In Quebec, the committee Gélineau has fulfilled that mandate. 
Following the reports and Gélineau Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma - Quebec to service the Quebec and the Canadian company blood to supply all the other provinces and two territories. 
"In 1998, when Héma - Quebec began its activities, only 38% of the people still had confidence in the system of blood in Quebec, recalls the Décary Dre." 
The situation was discouraging. 
By dint of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and working on the ground during the years that followed, we have restored public confidence, "said it before I say proudly that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the population québécoise now had confidence in Héma - Quebec." 
The Décary Dre however in mind that "trust is extremely precarious." 
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Héma - Quebec has applied the precautionary principle. 
At that time it was in Europe to many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which tells of the strong since its founding in 1998. 
"And we didn't know at all if the disease could be transmitted through blood." 
It was then relied on one of the main recommendations and Gélineau Krever reports that when we do not know, and that a serious disease can lead to, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterised by a degeneration of the brain, leading inevitably to death and introduced measures of exclusion. 
In April 1999, it was therefore refused the blood of the people who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980. 
However, a few years ago, it has been proven beyond all doubt that the disease is transmitted by blood. 
The episode has shown that the precautionary principle that has been applied "makes sense." 
In 1999 appeared on the market a technology much more sensitive to HIV screening tests: the acid nucléique (TAN) which directly detect in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, which relied tests used so far. 
The TAN enabled to shorten the period silent, which runs between the time when the person was infected and that when the first virus can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the expert. 
We were able to cut that period to less than a week. 
We have dwindled substantially the risk that some donors are infected without knowing it and that we can detect. 
These improvements have helped to reduce substantially the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion. 
Today, one in 12 million runs the risk of receiving blood contaminated with HIV. 
"In other words, this means that it will distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected by HIV." 
As Héma - Quebec distributes each year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products, it will take more than 24 years after that a case of transmission of HIV by a blood products. 
I believe that it can now feel comfortable to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to regain health, "says the head of the direction of Héma - Quebec." 
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products." 
You never know what pathogenic will emerge in the system. 
As recently as last year appeared on the island of Réunion the Chikungunya virus which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood. 
We must be constantly vigilant, 'continues the Décary Dre before point out that, in addition to a supply security, Héma - Quebec must also include an adequate supply. " 
"The needs are increasing as the population ages." 
The anti-cancer treatments being more aggressive, patients are often need a recharge in example red or platelets. 
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors which comprises on average only 3% of the Québécois allowable donation of blood. " 
Anyone in health, aged 18 years and more that meets the eligibility criteria may yet give blood every 56 days, or six times a year. 
On average, 14% of those who propose their blood are not accepted, because they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled in a country where there is malaria, they will be excluded during a period of one year. 
"With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals." 
The shortages are very rare. 
But we must renew the members of this network of donors as they mature and can no longer give of their blood. 
But it is difficult to convince people to give of their blood, but above all to retain and motivate them to become regular donor. 
Life today is so rampant, there is rarely time to spend an hour to give its blood, "Décary Francine regrets." 
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Héma - Quebec provides not only blood products, but also of human tissue, including bone, heart valves greffons globes, eye and skin that is almost exclusively used for severe burns. 
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored in Héma - Quebec, which is also the only public bank of umbilical cord in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord that was once considered a waste of biomedicine is full of a blood is rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukaemia. 
"It was celebrated, a few weeks ago, the bank of our thousandth cross-section of umbilical cord blood and is projected to take more than a thousand per year." 
We should begin to propose for transplants at the beginning of next year, "says the Dre Décary which describes this programme of levying of umbilical cord as very popular." 
"Many are disappointed no one cannot see. ', because Héma - Quebec does not have the resources to propose this programme complex and expensive in all hospitals in Quebec.

The trio number one for the Canadian is prepared to undertake a season. 
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn enlivened the attack in a gain of 3 (2) of the Canadian the rocket barrages against the Florida Panthers, last night at the Bell Centre. 
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, has scored a goal, Plekanec hoarded two aid, and Kovalev has collected a happening in that gain, the fourth of the Tricolore into six preparatory matches. 
Kovalev gave the victory with the sole purpose of the shooting. 
"I am not yet ready, warned the Russian." 
I have another match for me to feel comfortable. " 
"It has tried to do too much in the first period, has noted Guy Carbonneau." 
But I think he has welcomed the end of the match. 
It was a fine standing ovation. " 
Charest put on the North 
The prime minister does not trigger elections before the end of the year 
Immediately after the General Council of the Liberal Party finished, Jean Charest visited yesterday - Jean Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected on the occasion of the by-election today. 
"Push the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest has presented with visual strength while remaining within the broad outlines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, Lévis yesterday. 
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of Moulin to images. 
Go on continuously, on three huge screens, clichés spectacular hydroelectric generation, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps," cards, etc. 
Of the major means as at election time. 
In point of press, moreover, the prime minister has refused to rule out that it would unleash the elections this autumn, although it noted that her schedule was very busy. 
The North "is the fourth part of a" vision "that the prime minister claims to have for the Quebec, that of a" new economic area ", which includes an agreement on the workforce with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with the Ontario. 
Often mentioned in the speech by the prime minister recently, the opening of the north - northern territory at the 49th parallel, had never been the subject of a presentation. 
The prime minister has however been to explain why the North was "a jewel in the huge potential," but did not give any timescale, investment figures or specific priority in future planning. 
At most a few avenues of what could be developed further, including hydro-electricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, has boosted by growth in emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure. 
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platine, gold, silver, iron, bow, and even diamonds", according to the list of Mr. Charest. 
This "territory twice as large as France '," this is home, is in Quebec. " 
Not only is among us, but it is with us, "he insisted, as to make it clear that it was asking a national myth." 
Quebec has many built in its relationship with the North, "he emphasized: gold fever in Abitibi, engineering, québécoise Bay James. 
"It is up to us, it is our future," he added, having made a dramatic pause to look at the huge map behind him. 
The North, 70% of the territory québécois, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, has said the prime minister at the point of press. 
"It is a traditional position that all the governments have repeated." 
There is a line of border on which there is no ground for a very long time, and when the opportunity presents itself, I reiterate this position on behalf of the government, "he said. 
The rest, "with climate change, we have to rethink our vision of the North," he said in talking about the passage of the northwest, due to open all year because of the melting of the ice. 
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupy the territory is a duty. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, the Premières Nations and the Inuits? 
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially to young people. 
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Member of péquiste Ungava), have already started consultations with some 30 communities. 
An inter-ministerial Relocation Committee chaired by Benedict Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport) natural resources and has an important place began its work. 
The prime minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "there will be a common vision." 
The development of the north would be in line with the principles of sustainable development. 
Plan north will be "a concerted, ordered and respectful of the environment," he promised. 
Jean Charest has described this "vision" as being in line with that of prime minister liberals that preceded it. 
"As the Liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to transform the challenges and new opportunities for growth and development." 
It has also been one of the themes of the end of the week, which began Friday by a large cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party. 
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Central Beauharnois in Adélard - Barrage Godbout. 
"Godbout, which created Hydro Quebec, Lesage, who has done the Revolution captaincy, and the nationalisation of hydro-electricity, Bourassa, who has made the Bay James, our party has been able to shape the future," said Jean Charest. 
In point of press, he invoked another reference, conservative, the programme "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963. 
In addressing the hydroelectric dam project to Eastmain1a - Ruper, Mr. Charest has stressed that its operation was scheduled for 2012. 
"It remains between us here, but I expect to be there," he entrusted to its militants, causing home of applause. 
Indeed, Prime Minister, which said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, has not ruled out the possibility of triggering an election this autumn, what the law allows it. 
He stresses that his schedule is fulfilled, particularly by a mission of the board of the federation in China and a Quebec Summit, New York. 
The General Council of the end of this week has provided the Liberal leader a platform containing resolutions nationalists, including the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ demands especially the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec 'in the Constitution. 
We also hope that the Quebec appoints members of the Council of broadcasting and telecommunications Canadian and that they have a right of veto on the decisions taken in Quebec. 
On the side of the opposition, has reacted the broad outlines of the plan north with scepticism. 
The head péquiste, Pauline Marois, has emerged from the Neighborhood Development Nord-du-Québec that the government Landry was launched in 2001. 
According to them, the Liberal government, in office in 2003, has decided not to apply it. 
Had he done so, "it would be" more advanced today commented on Ms. Marois alongside its candidate in Jean - Talon (election taking place today), FranÃ§oise Mercure. 
The adq said support the adoption of a Plan north by the government. 
"But what we want is that it is not just a spectacle," commented the leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who has just returned from holiday today. 
Letters - A countries dishonoured 
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice "(oh irony) in the cabinet Harper, who hits last summer to say of Louise Arbour that it was a" shame "for Canada. 
And casting aspersions on the woman who has waged an unending struggle for justice and which deserves our admiration says as much about the entourage of the prime minister, Stephen Harper himself. 
We find ourselves in a government which is the only one, of all the western countries involved, not to be brought back its nationals imprisoned in the concentration camp in Guantánamo. 
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the facts that it is accused. 
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies his word and spent rotting leaves in inhumane conditions a child soldier. 
The only one who swear by a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused. 
Remember, for the record, that international Amnistie UNICEF, and Canadian Bar Association, in particular, argue for the repatriation of Omar Khadr, so that it will receive a fair trial in Canada. 
It is the same government that turns a blind eye to torture: it does not matter that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps never to return after so many years of abuse. 
It does not yet account, but at the moment we are seeing a creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', a word which Harper continues to hold up and that sounds so hollow in his mouth. 
Now is the time where no morals, no longer exists: we can push arbitrarily imprison, torture, a Canadian citizen, according to the benefit of a head of government until now a minority (what will happen after the 14 October...). 
Number of voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates the Vertu, the Law and the Ordre: they do not see that this government has abandoned what was the reputation and dignity of our country. 
The shame, Mr. Toews, it is here, in this instance, and not elsewhere. 
Free opinion - The speech of Barrick Gold Orwellian 
In its edition of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, deputy director of the Canadian mining Barrick Gold. 
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, it says that the largest company in the world aurifère tried to bring a prosecution in defamation of six million against three authors and a small publishing house penniless in order to launch a public debate "transparent." 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, this is not the truth as they see, especially in the case of prosecutions for libel, but the law. 
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver. 
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate that it would lead to the ruin anyone could support a position contrary to his own? 
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and the publisher of the book black Canada will have to spend large sums in order to prepare their defence and to fight, weapons very unequal, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets. 
The tactics, in these struggles unequal, is often accused of ruining the order to impose an amicable settlement which bâillonnera opposition in addition to frighten anyone would dare to look again at the question. 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in the public that it was to present his vision of the facts. 
Contrary to what is being done in several countries where works Barrick Gold, the debates in Canada are normally made by the exchange of ideas and not to blows inflicted. 
It was sufficient to the mining to open its books, files and to establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, publications and funding for independent research teams which could shed light on the issue. 
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public and rejects out of hand the petitions and letters of support to the authors of black Canada. 
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he could ask a "public debate" while disregard for the opinions of the public? 
In the world of Vice-President, it seems that this word designates only the highly paid lawyers and not all the Canadians; that is a view rather close to the concept. 
In a democracy, even the critics have the right to speak. 
What does not understand - or does not want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of black Canada the fact primarily because it rejects the brutal way. 
The public is prepared to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilised exchange of arguments, and not in the context of what many see as a pursuit - gag (pursuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just elsewhere to lodge a formal notice of the authors of black Canada but to stop the use of this term...). 
Beyond the surréel speech Mr. Garver, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the quest for truth, essential to a democratic society. 
It denies, en bloc, the right to quote from credible sources and the debate on the facts and interpretations, who represent the very basis of the intellectual task. 
If it is impossible to study and discuss issues that do not like the rich companies of the world in a country such as Canada, under pain of prosecution, which will be able to do this? 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate and transparent, it could do so in accordance with the scientific standards used by the perpetrators of black Canada. 
It has a right of reply. 
The academic world, to which we belong, has long been known manage the debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts. 
Barrick Gold of excessive prosecution clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no appetite for a debate transparent. 
It is a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place arrangements restricting such prosecution abusive. 
Rescue operation of Wall Street, Democrats and Republicans agree 
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republican and Democrat, have finally come to an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
The new version of the plan of 700 billion US dollars aimed at curbing the financial crisis affecting Wall Street for months must still be approved by both chambers of Congress. 
It refers in particular: better control by the elected representatives of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the return of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of homes seized for a default, and a right to scrutinise the salaries paid to the leaders of companies being helped. 
US Secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the Republican representative at the table of negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, have announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a marathon negotiations in two days. 
"We have made great progress in terms of an agreement which will be effective on the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
"Everything has been done to shelter the real economy and ordinary Americans for the ongoing crisis in Wall Street," explained the democrat. 
"It is the fundamental point: if we do not do that, the trauma, chaos and disruptions on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said the Republican Judd Gregg. 
The talks had turned into a sprint down the final hours for fear of the effect of a new setback on investor sentiment. 
The time limit that we had agreed was the opening up of markets this morning. 
Associates late in the negotiations, the two candidates for the US presidential election were more understanding, without fail, however, to express their displeasure that it took to get to that. 
The Democrat Senator Obama has attributed the addition of certain provisions in the agreement, including the proposal to allow homeowners to keep their homes and the one on the pay of corporate leaders rescapées by the state. 
"When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures due to the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to write." 
But these measures are necessary, "he commented on the airwaves on American television." 
Another channel when questioned about whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope that yes." 
"The broad lines that I have read [LEFT-BRACKET shows] that this is something we are all going to digest and with which we will be able to move forward." 
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable, "he said." 
The plan aims to 700 billion buying up (with taxpayers' money bad loans, and risk assets to be sold in the US financial institutions. 
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble, which has first led to the collapse of sub-prime mortgages (subprime) before extending to other types of securities more widespread credit (PCAA) and lead to a freeze of liquidity and the exodus of banks and financial institutions. 
This is a group of elected Republicans that wrecked the first draft agreement last week. 
It is believed to be taken out of this impasse since Democrats have accepted that some active "toxic" for companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than bought. 
In order to cut corners for everyone in Congress, it has also added a provision that if the government should take losses for five years with this programme, it could put in place new taxes to help to recover its costs. 
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial tranche, of 250 billion to which can be added another 100 billion if the president deems it necessary. 
The payment of 350 other billion should be approved by a vote of Congress. 
In exchange for his help, Washington will get holdings in companies being helped to create dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to sell when the storm is gone. 
The federal government will have the possibility to delay the procedures of foreclosures on homes attached to the loans covered by the plan, and to set limits on the starting pay and fees paid to leaders of companies affected. 
The architects of the plan would be put to a vote in the House of Representatives today, and the Senate on Wednesday. 
Despite all their efforts, it is not even certain that their plan will have the green light. 
Voices have indeed continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican camp that democrat. 
"Obviously, Washington do not hear you," said to his constituents the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Finance Committee of the House. 
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem." 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not to take advantage of the taxpayers. " 
Promoter of a small group in Congress dubbed "the caucus of doubters," Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presented things differently, but comes to the same conclusion. 
"Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel Laureates, wrote to us saying: we ask the Congress to not hurry and carefully examine the path to take," he said yesterday. 
At the same time, in Europe, it was once again the global nature of the crisis. 
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries have announced the partial assumption of the banking group Fortis to 11.2 billion euros (16,3 billion US). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would not be involved in acquiring its competitor in trouble since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the sub-prime mortgage and crisis in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is one of the 21 major European banks and of the ten largest insurers. 
"This is not wasted money, said yesterday the Dutch Finance Minister, Wouter Bos." 
In exchange, it includes a right to vote in the bank and influence. 
That is something that savers and households like now that the time forebodes uncertain. " 
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel Tunnel, the British government appeared on track to nationalize another bank badly handled by the financial crisis. 
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans from the bank Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (75,5 billion US). 
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy branches and the customers of the British bank. 
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, the British Government should nationalise since the beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925 - 2008) - death of an icon committed 
Its beauty in the eyes of blue was long its ace card, some would say its weakness. 
He was released from the mirror narcissique American player, the smile charmer? 
Yes and no. 
Modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that will be the source of flowing too far removed from the register of power which actually giving rise to the real monsters sacrosanct. 
But what big long-distance athlete! 
Paul Newman, disappeared Friday in 83 years, due to lung cancer in his ranch of Connecticut, remains one of the last icônes of American cinema of the good years. 
Less monumental than Brando, who he was and he was long a kind of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also the apostle of freedom and the splitting up of the dramatic conventions. 
The mixed blood often make wonderful children. 
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother home. 
Of these European roots will generate a glorious faces of the American dream. 
Without towering egos, the final stamp of quality. 
It is projeta because in a country with a great love of self made man, the fighter of the war in the Pacific, wounded in battle, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic arts at Yale and then fréquenta the Actor's Studio in New York, before prevail in the theatre, television, soon to film. 
The same man who milita civil rights for the pilot was also the car which is classa second to 24 hours of the Mans in 1979, coupled with a sex symbol, albeit a member of a couple model formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward were. 
Also disappearing with him the grey areas in this secret star, unobtrusive, committed, allergic to smoke the show-business, which we will not entirely holes the puzzle. 
An honest man, in the truest sense of the term. 
The disappearance of Paul Newman has provided startling to the cinema goers this weekend, while its major roles collide on the screen black memories. 
More than half a century of an American seventh art flashes by constantly changing around him. 
Return jostling one another to remember the cowboy charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting its sensuous wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a roof burning adapted to Tennessee Williams in 1958. 
Closer to us (1990), her sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed in his old age in a marriage that do not fulfil all its promises. 
Both other Paul Newman grew to history. 
This boxeur Rocky Graziano, troubled, violent criminals, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Dr (Marqué by hatred), Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, continued after his death, which launched really Newman in 1956. 
This malfrat appealing in the brillantissime The Sting (Arnaque), Oscar the best film in 1973. 
"Ping pong 'player in the bitter and avenger by Robert Rossen wonderful The Hustler (1961), it will resume the man on the return in The Color of Money for Martin Scorsese in 1987, which won him his only Oscar on nine nominations. 
This face throughout the ages, it was him. 
Even him. 
The times have been squeezed through its journey. 
Young people know it above all through the cultissime Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977), Reggie Dunlop, coach of a team of unorthodox Hockey World Championship. 
His fans have found in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy Coen brothers. 
With a final role of Mafia godfather Irish Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the circle was complete. 
Against several legends film, which lâchèrent early enough, Newman will remained long on track, while denouncing Hollywood, its ors, its good and its concessions. 
The film-maker Bertrand Tavernier was regarded, not without irony, "as a living challenge to the" underplaying "judging its benefits too supported." 
The profession has not always been kind to the beautiful Paul Newman who cooked all the roles fell long in the tooth. 
He played but less often young first that the marginal: névrosés or swines, alcoholic, desperate, including its features perfect reflétèrent excesses and the revolts. 
As director, Newman proved facet poorly known its true sensitivity both. 
Her Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (from the novel of the Canadienne Margaret Inspector Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward were in the lead role, traçait an end female portrait of melancholy. 
He who lost her son Scott by overdose him dédia his film Harry and Son in 1984, out of shame and sadness. 
Among the rain of people déferlait yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former colleague Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very sad, "its presence has made my life and this country better." 
Generosity, love of the existence of distress calls features of the player disappeared. 
Beyond his career is fading away, as well as a great campaigner for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a excesses of Hollywood. 
We have seen many of its binette pots on trôner vinaigrette, sauces, biscuits and other food, judging the joke in poor taste, albeit at the outset. 
The profits of these sales were nevertheless paid to his Foundation for Children in difficulty. 
Newman, rather than sit on his myth, has engaged until the end. 
He left his five daughters a letter containing these words: "Always and until the end, your father has been incredibly grateful for his lucky star." 
It was a privilege to be there. " 
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of an American artist if lucid and generous. 
In short, model citizen and above. 
That could well produce Zuschlag & and; Society in their factory to bills? 
Soon, on 8 October, will begin the proceedings relating to criminal proceedings underway against János Zuschlag and his accomplices. 
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud in the form of criminal organisation, permanently and regular, that have caused great damage and other charges were retained against them, as for example, false and use of false. 
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the money from subsidies, was spent for personal use, while the benefits were justified by false invoices. 
The money of the state and the municipalities, approximately 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand into the coffers of the movement Fiatal Baloldal and on the other hand, in the pockets of some people. 
Their method, made public by the authorities in charge of the investigation, was to receive the money grants obtained by issuing bills of costs, behind which no real provision was given and thus, the associations do not respect their commitments. 
According to the indictment, most of the bills were untrue. 
For these, they - the perimeter of the bills Józsefváros market, while fabriquaient stamps to Kiskunhalas. 
For the names of companies which would appear on the bills, it was decided, among other things, in the northern province touring Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, on request to János Zuschlag. 
According to the evidence of the latter, it had to identify pensions and restaurants. 
For his personal consumption, he called for a bill that, on the model of imparting the other bills that they will include, among others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipalité of the Capital for access to a subsidy. 
The majority of invoices was created by István Lados and his accomplice András?ri, which according to our information, was involved in drafting the documents necessary for obtaining grants. 
In a "circuit to spot", one of the choice of Lados was a bistro. 
According to the two invoices by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place has assured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the Association Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
However, according to what the manager, it would have been impossible that so many people are in this place, at the same time. 
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the bill on behalf of the foundation Jobb Jöv?ért, which subsequently will bear the name of Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért, grouillait ill-structured forms and content. 
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, had in fact that three chambers, and maximum ten people could spend the night, but the bill was 230 customers. 
Issuers of bills to outrageous have also fallen in excess, when they mentioned Kft Pigal society, even in the hotel and catering sector. in their accounts, nor the name of Jobb Jöv?ért nor that of the Hoppá seaports, according to the information given to the public prosecutor's office. 
Gy?z? Farkas, the manager of the company, said at the site. hvg hu that when the public prosecutor's office has called and he showed bills, he has succeeded, immediately, that it was false documents. 
"The name of our society and our number of tax were placed in a bad place on the stamp." 
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that according to the bill, a hundred people were housed there, not very truthful headline either, since there are only 11 rooms, who do not have as much room." 
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant is closed for a long time. " 
Issuers eager bills are not informed about the travel agencies of Budapest, as part of their choice, but only organising trips abroad. thus, naively, they have made trips in Hungary on bills to settle in cash, which is also against the accounting practices of the agency. 
Moreover, as it emerged during the investigation, they ajoutèrent also VAT on these documents, while the benefits on the activities of trips, whose destination is outside the European Union, are paid for without VAT. 
Similarly, the VAT rate of four bills established on behalf of the Révfülöp Hotel in order to Jobb Jöv?ért was incorrect, since the benefits of society do not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT to 15%. the employees of the hotel bills do not issue written on them, while the false were prepared to hand. 
The survey by the Public Prosecution Department reveals that the "issuers" have also made mistakes stating that provide the transport of goods by road, that the company issuing bills could not exert, given that his profile was the board in investment. 
Moreover, it is also for the faults of forms, such as the types of bills inadequate and false stamps, that bills issued the order of Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont proved to be inaccurate. 
As in the case of society Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó sporting carer, who all deny being the perpetrators of the two bills issued on their behalf. 
The counterfeiters have also paid no attention to the fact that society. Kft HIB, based in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at a time when (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to take a meal at home, according to our information, it is for this reason that the official of the company denies having made this bill. 
Bills set deliberately 
A group of other issuers of bills is made up of those who were fully aware that they were asked to submit bills. 
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, has drawn up a bill to the order of the foundation Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of four million HUF. 
According to the indictment, the manager of the company. Kft Collab was forced to make false bills by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi. 
Similarly, has cooperated with the Zuschlags, society Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and that in 2003, has issued bills on the order of the foundation Jobb Jöv?ért Alapítvány, the Association Atlasz Egyesület and the Association Vörösfeny? Egyesület, for an amount of around five million HUF, but behind which no provision has actually been delivered. 
No financial movement has taken place, either, given that the invoices were cancelled, but that the bodies have avoided mention it in their books. 
The category of companies that issue invoices is that companies directly linked to the accused. 
Thus, the delegate administrative of the Director-General of society. Kft Trió Delta, in charge of trade of fuel and motor vehicles, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where there was nowhere to be found, was Kubatov Iván. 
In October, November and December 2005, the company has issued several bills concerning the sale of computer equipment, totalling approximately 18 million HUF. 
According to the survey, such equipment would have been bought by the company. Kft Cash Investment of Kiskunhalas, who was in liquidation since 14 September 2005. 
The director of that company was a man of Romanian origin, who Kubatov Iván would have also received documents in connection with the company, between 2002 and 2005. 
As far as we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation he has issued bills to order companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he pocketed their countervalue. 
It is precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that Romanian builders have created companies Fa - Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos - Investment Bt. 
In fact, none of these companies do operate, what the defendant is explained by the fact that they did not receive job. 
It is served when even these companies, since at the request of MaÃ®tre Zsolt Szente, coaccusé and draftsman for acts of foundation of societies, it has established the bills in their names in the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as associations Atlasz and Y - Generáció. 
Kubatov has given to organizations, 15 bills in total, made by companies Trió Cash Investment, Delta, Fa - Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, at a value of 14,2 million HUF. 
The public prosecutor's office believed that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoice and VAT went into the pockets of Kubatov. 
The man has even used the company Szi - Beri Bt. to establish false bills that have been used in the context of the request of subsidy for Biztos Pont. 
In January 2006, the Association Y - Generáció and Szövetség has Modern Magyarországért have applied for a grant from the body of public utility of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (MRI). 
They got that subsidy for an amount of 500 000 HUF twice, but these amounts have not been used for the objectives set out in the request. 
To prevent this from happening know, five bills fictitious received from society. Kft TEAM Works were presented to the MRI. 
Moreover, it is these bills that have been found during the raid on the office of árpád Kemecsei, the Ministry of Education. 
During the hearing, some of the accused relatera the method of manufacture of bills, as it did back before the public prosecutor earlier. 
What could be really interesting is that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil on history. 
So far, its admissions are not very detailed, and although he has promised on several occasions recounting every detail, it has not yet done so. 
The question is whether it is in its interest, or, possibly, the Socialists have reached an agreement that in exchange for the reimbursement of a large section of the 50 million HUF, Zusi would only the hat. 
Today, it is probably offended, since the requests for his placement under house arrest, on the basis of a reduction of his conditions of detention, continually fall on deaf ears. 
While those who have caused damage much more important, and the perpetrators of economic crimes not repairable, roam freely or at least, are waiting for their own home, the end of the procedure. he does not have this possibility. 
The psychology of one-upmanship: why are we spending more money? 
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and to overestimate the commodity. 
Researchers in neurology, and economics at the University of New York have managed to update the neurological foundations and economic behaviour known and apparently irrational. 
According to a study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be dependent at this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they prefer even pay too high a price. 
This research have tried to draw up a neurological pattern of this sort of "game" with the help of experimental auction. 
One of the groups of volunteers plays lottery numbers, while another group took part in an auction playful, while using a method of functional magnetic resonance (IRMf), researchers studied the experimental subjects of active brain areas. 
In both games, the participants could earn money, but during the auction, a key element is the surfeit of a third, all situated below the waistline strokes, called the striatum, was in intensive way movement at the loss of the game. 
This part of the brain, alongside several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "auto stimulating the nervous system." 
That is why, according to researchers, the rise in prices is with the brain to the violent reaction of the striatum. 
In support of their theories, the economists in this group of researchers have pursued analyses of financial supervision. 
During these three groups surenchérissaient with a partner, in various circumstances. 
They were simply informed the group control of the real value of the product in question, and they have done their way. 
In another group, they promised that if, in addition, they went to the winner of the game, then they would get 15 additional dollars in prizes. 
While the third group has received these 15 dollars before the auction, but also members of the group are losing this money, if they lost the bidding. 
The difference between these two groups is, in fact, that the emphasis was placed in the one on the victory, while in the other, on failure. 
In proving the hypothesis of neurologues, members of the team of players "against the failure" were prepared to be higher than those made by the group control and the group "for the victory." 
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any economic theory existing." 
Indeed, each of them has explained the phenomena observed at auctions and by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk. 
Only the neurological imaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two leading theories, now, on a third explanation. "- found Andrew Schotter, the teacher in the Faculty of economics from the University of New York." 
Hepatitis: when should we consult a doctor? 
In the world, around half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, the chronic disease of the liver is mentioned among the main causes of death. 
An estimated 100 miles patients carrying the virus of hepatitis in Hungary, but only seven miles are undergoing treatment. this is the fact that often sick people do not know they are carriers of the virus. 
The name is a generic name given hepatitis infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses. 
There are many similarities between their symptoms. the inflammation of the liver and the jaunisse are characteristics, but the pathogens and the diseases caused differ from each other. 
The virus of hepatitis, according to the pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: the hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: food or water contaminated), hepatitis B, C, D and other virus by blood and sperm, (organic liquid secretion, vaginale spittle). 
For passengers, in any event, it is recommended to get inoculated against the virus A and B. there is no vaccine against the C. 
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated feed, in general, accompanied by a bad state general, weakness, nausea and stomach evils. 
Then develops on the skin and the white of the eye a jaunisse visible, the selles should become clearer and more colour takes a urine. foncée healing can take two to three weeks. 
Around the world each year, a million people die of the worst form of the disease, like cancer or cirrhosis of the liver damage from hepatitis B.. 
The main cause is that according to estimates, only one person in ten receives medical treatment. 
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer. 
Most people do not know reached the virus, because the causative gene in a rather sly destroys the liver cells. in many cases, the first symptoms are not apparent until after 20 to 30 years. 
Consequently, an early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests. 
The contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: those who have suffered a blood transfusion before 1991, the consumers of drugs and the tatoués. 
Currently, we figure to 200 million patients suffering from chronic hepatitis C type in the world. 
Because the disease can be detected by a routine examination in a laboratory, it is advisable to consult his doctor treating from the observation of symptoms of unknown origin. 
The disease can be healed, if it is detected in time. the virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of infection disappears and the development of cancer is warned. 
On 30 September is the World Day of hepatitis, organised for the first time in 2004 by organisations representing patients throughout the world. 
Its aim is to draw attention to the chronic cirrhosis of the liver, caused by the virus, on the causes of its development and on the importance of early diagnosis of the disease. 
Anyone who believes in God has he less pain? 
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a sort of pain reliever, who would have already contributed to make more bearable Catholic martyrs death. 
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article that researchers at Oxford University have made an interesting in looking at what level the belief in God could influence tolerance for the pain of the human being. 
In the context of this experience for bizarre 12 Catholic believers and atheists have been subjected to electric shock therapy, while each of them was a painting depicting the Virgin Mary. 
According to the results, Catholic believers have been able to exclude much of the suffering. 
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also able to discover that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for the regulation of the pain. 
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments, which académiciens, scientists, philosophers and theologians are from various sectors of the university. 
More specifically, the experience is as follows: an instrument that introduce sparks and broadcasting the ECT is set on the left hand of the experimental subject. 
Researchers have asked the participants to the experience of watching a sustained two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady in the hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in 15ème century. 
Researchers at the origin of this experience had hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary is a sort of status of faith among the believers, while the choice of paintings by da Vinci, not very different from the first, was on its calming effect. 
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, meanwhile, have received 20 ECT in four part is after, just by looking at either the paint religious theme, or the one to issue more broadly. 
Catholics have said that in the view of the Virgin Mary, they felt as' safe ', as someone who "takes care" and they have "be quiet, and peace has invaded." 
In view of the paint of religious themes, they have realised for 12% of pain in less than when they were watching the work of Leonard. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who had taken part in the experiment, believe that we can achieve the same effects with any other strong image among atheists, provided to find the appropriate photo. 
"We should find an image in which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist. 
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research. 
"The practice of the faith should change and in many cases, change indeed our personality," said Wright. 
After these excellent results, that leaves only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain issues if we show the believers a Madone painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same arms? 
Does the sight of a Virgin Mary better would lead to better results? 
You are what you divulgues down to your subject 
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google says that it can be found at the bottom of the pockets of the people in the same way as the skies above their heads. he knows where they have spent their vacations, they should consult specialists and what are their interests. 
It is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of those who have influence of society. 
While with regard to the sceptics establishing a parallel with the horror of Orwell, they do not see the bulk of the Web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt said recently in the Financial Times that the high ambitions of Google is to gather more information about its users. this is necessary so that the founders of Google can adhere to their original purpose was as follows: "Set out in a system all the information in the world!" 
According to the leader of Google asked, after ten years of a chamboulement work world, they are still only at the beginning of their objectives to be able to deal with all the information. 
To the question: what actually happens in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google can respond to questions such as "what could I do tomorrow? 'or' what is the work that I would be the best? '. however, software cannot respond to this kind of issue, simple at first glance, the day when they will go on users. 
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used in research on the Internet, the IP address of the computer which sends research and the pages consulted then by those interested are listed. 
Through the programme Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, storing their own historical research and can read what they have tried, on what they have cliqué. thanks to this, in the long term, Recommandations programme, based on the same logic, will be able to respond much more intimate, and we will submit products and services on the basis of our previous statements and our preferences recorded. 
What happens if someone is using my data against me, if we look at what is my job? ask users, who are worried when they see the monopoly of information from Google. 
In most cases, it is the power potential represented by the company that can cause to fear, and this is not the remorse, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against the power that can cause among surfers a against - reaction. 
However, this is a fact confirmed that the terms sought are not only registered, but in justified cases, they are sent to a third, and in this kind of legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users. 
The most resounding example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against paedophiles Brazilian, during which Google has forwarded to the Brazilian government information he had gathered on page public called Orkut, thereby providing an identification. 
Internet users who are concerned about the rights of individuals have been able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arm it with the body of legal protection electronic EFF, has proven its good right to the court against the FBI. after the judgment, in the future, Google will still not be obliged by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information on the request of the FBI, secret of any kind. 
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50 000 000 Web addresses and search terms that he had won in relation to the strengthening of the law on the protection of the child, voted several years ago, but in the end, it fails to get the lists of searches of private users, or the whole list of Internet sites and the key words of the last two months. 
The judgment of Google is quite contradictory: it is attacked by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they believe that their intimate and private sector suffer when they are starting to use the services Google. therefore, they are attacking them in the spirit of revolt that manifesto against multinational companies proud of their conservative image. 
Meanwhile, the US and its "geek culture sauvageons" with the fans, the activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see Google the next generation of big business, "corporation trendy", as opposed to his rival, Microsoft, classified as invader of the world because of Windows, even though both are fighting for the same purpose. 
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, it does not call for its users with identification code, is not asking for money for its applications. the code documentary and the package of programmes, constantly renewed, has a much more accessible, younger and more cool, faced with the practice of official of the software giant. 
The reason may be that the geeks are exactly the relationship problems between the rights of the individual and the Internet, and what the Web 2.0, the key word most proclaimed in recent years, is right behind him. 
Indeed, the Web 2.0 is not something other than cooperation, that the fact that we leave intentionally traces behind us, and that we are using the channels of communication available to us, and while the scale of these changes one by one, the most important thing remains the same: are exposed. 
A young, in general, can take a public profile on several pages on Facebook, Xanga, and it can even link them to other benefits, such as Twinter, or last. fm, listant its musical habits, and then he can connect them to a tracking system, as FriendFeed or Blip. fm. these young people can also keep blogs, in which appear automatically their latest galleries of photos they stock on Flickr or Picasa. 
While we can hear many examples, such as the girlfriend who understands easily to view photos of the morning, taken by the ring of friends in common, with whom his friend infidel spent the evening, or that of the company that has dismissed one of its employees to the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about the top management, we may be on to something: the term of privacy is completely to reconsider these days. 
Those who live a life online, consists of what he makes of himself, and that is how we can define the principle behind the behaviour of the young people of today. 
That is to hide something, or at least wants to try to circumvent the monopoly of Google, can do (starting with, for example, Scroogle, using the system to search Google, but, at the same time, leaving no trace intentionally). 
The number of people who, deliberately, does not have public pages so that it is not possible to locate them, is not insignificant. services from Google online, via the processing of text and image processing to reading of information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to huge offshore servers and assemble our best profile, having existed to date. 
The public expects, without really is in hiding, when Google be unveiling its true nature. 
The company, with its current value of 156 billion dollars, is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). the AdSense / AdWords advertising areas threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while the benefits introduced at a speed of more and more important cause serious headaches not only Microsoft, but to many other creators of computer programs. 
However, observers are critical, in addition to all this, the contradictions which have worrying effects: for example, the top management of the company refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it has doubled the price of the kindergarten of company and after that society has found it too costly multiple meals daily, taken at any time. all this pales beside the fact that already in 2006, Google has assented to the Chinese government and after the terms of their agreement, the company sees all the results that offend against good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime. 
According to one of the internal rules of society, the new services are not announced when they can be used. this is about is that in the coming months and years to come, they are going to move the world on new issues. while some believe that the draft scan and archiving of books and magazines dimensions of Google is so important that the company will soon find themselves facing the Supreme Court of the United States, others tremble before its Health System, because in it, you can build a comprehensive medical benefit from our previous results of analyses, our doctors and our problems. 
The fact that Google is mounting a genetic database can give a good raw material for the next generation of authors of fiction; the novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with orwelliens half shade, described a future in which a man could be approached in a dazzling nothing that through the data from Google. 
Two miners have helped to wipe away the traces of double homicide of Ózd 
"The police has convened two minors to interrogate them in the case of double homicide of Ózd." 'after the justifiable suspicion, they have helped to wipe away the traces of crime. ", said the spokesman of the department of Borsod station. 
Young people have acknowledged the crimes of which they are accused. for the moment, they are accused of complicity. 
The two minors, who, according to the information to Hungarian Télégraphique Agency (MTI) are young girls, defend themselves free. 
The accessory to murder can lead to a detention of up to 5 years. 
The suspect of double homicide of Ózd corner, a young man of 23 years, was placed in provisional detention on Sunday. 
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and interest. 
During the investigation, it was revealed that the young man of 23 years was a large sum of money to a man of 53 years. 
The suspect did not want to settle its debts, and that is why he drew his creditor, last Wednesday, in a Ózd site where he was killed, as well as the girl of this man, aged 9 years. 
According to the information of the MTI, the young man has sunk his crime. the weapon with which he was going to commit his crimes hidden on the scene of the crime is proof of that. 
The police is investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists. 
The Warsaw stock exchange is a proposal for the takeover of the Prague Stock Exchange 
The stock market values of Warsaw has proposed two hundred million, around five billion Czech crowns, to buy 100% of the package of shares of the stock market values of Prague. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the stock values of Warsaw, confirmed this proposal that the Polish have made in spite of that, previously, the Czechs have ruled out the Warsaw Stock Exchange the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange. 
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw stock is owned by the state. 
99% of the shares are owned by the Polish state which wants to secede from more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activities. 
According to the Czech business daily, the proposal of E15 Polish represents the highest offer has been made so far for the purchase of the stock of Prague. 
According to the Czech press, the stock exchanges of Vienna, the transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, the Stock Exchange of New York, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date. 
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that all involved, the Warsaw stock exchange would be the new owner the less good, and has not ruled out the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future. 
The value of the stock of Prague is estimated at between 5 to 10 billion Czech crowns by specialists from the market. 
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold. 
The most important owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25% of holdings, followed by the FF 14.7% of the bank and the Tiger Holding Ceská Sporitelna Four S. a.r. l.. with 13.5%. 
The financial crisis from the perspective of the European press 
In their comments Tuesday devoted to the international financial crisis is worsening day by day, newspapers, leaders of the European press already talking about a "second 11 September." 
"The overall financial disaster, the needs of the American President" - accuses the Rome newspaper La Repubblica. "the president has not even been able to stand shoulder to shoulder with his own party behind a bill, improvised replies, in a rush to help a wholly depressing situation..." 
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as was the billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk of a second September 11. 
Some of the press Madrid also sees the scapegoat in Washington. 
According to the vision of the newspaper El Mundo, the shortcomings of the political leadership there has led to the global economy on the verge of collapse. 
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system every day, and then the world will pay a high price. 
The Bush plan was far from perfect, but of after the vote of the Congress, a real danger threat, that Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis. 
The global economy hangs in the empty, just as in the history of capitalism, one of the biggest transformation took place. 
We cannot ignore the threat any longer - highlights the day - Anzeiger of Geneva. 
Some states can still be a lifeline to their financial bodies titubants, and thanks to their own taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy. 
Of course, if still more banks collapsing like dominoes, but neither the money nor new improvisations will not be enough. 
In the long term, we need the states of the European Union do not think much of their national egoism, and of centralising control over financial markets divided. 
Nothing that on Monday, the financial bodies weakened have received more than 100 billion - has reminded the Viennese newspaper, Der Standard, who adds that fears that European taxpayers also are going to have to put their hands in their pockets, very deep, in a manner similar to the US in order to resolve the crisis, become more and more realistic. 
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, as a tsunami, crossing, on the other, the old continent. 
"Rescue forces wearing" must not fly immediately 100 billion, though it would be good if they notaient in which case it would be reasonable to reach taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing major damage. 
The car theft of bourdon intelligent emulate 
What method would be best to develop technologies intended to avoid an obstacle, if not the imitation of a detector obstacles that already exists in nature? 
For example, that of bees. 
In the draft astonishing presented at the CEATEC, which take place in Japan, bees have given the idea bourdonnantes strategic departure engineers to cuts at Nissan, for inspiration on how they should design the next generation of detectors of obstacles. 
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini car robot, a system to control auto robotisé bio- inspired, type BR23C, he has equipped the qualities of bees, the final objective is to encourage the development of a system capable of preventing all the obstacles. 
During its flight, each bees is its own space, form oval, which in fact, is very similar to our hull secure protection - has explained at the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the department research and technological development and public relations for the brand. 
The eye to facets of bees also plays an important role, because it is able to see in all directions, in a context of 300 degrees. 
To mimic the functions of the eye to facets, engineers have raised the idea of télémètre to laser rays. 
It identifies the obstacles in the way of 180 degrees and at a distance of two metres in front of the BR23C, it evaluates distances and sends a signal to the microprocessor to board, who then become immediately avoidance maneuver. 
The perception of the obstacle is taking place in a split second. secondly, the mini car robot, imitating the movements of bees, immediately change the direction of his wheels as the shift from a light enough to avoid the collision. 
Contrary to all existing system currently, this manoeuvre avoidance takes place entirely instinctively. 
"If this is not the case, the mini car robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the project and Mobilité Laboratoire robotisée car. 
It must react instinctively and instantaneous, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and most inside the envelope, a protective layer where for the moment the collision is inevitable. 
All this process must reflect what bees to prevent other bees. 
The process should take place in the blink of an eye. 
Unlike the bees, the difference cannot go upwards or downwards, diagonal, it cannot be that two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn. 
In this way, instead of infinite combinations that have bees to prevent other bees, in our case, we could not use that the movement rotatif, the acceleration and deceleration as maneuvering at the disposal of the mini car robot 
The BR23C uses polymère Lithium batteries that are lighter and whose concentrated energy is greater, which makes their longer life expectancy than the version Lithium - but. 
According to Andoh, it is the intelligent instinctive reaction which is important, not the treatment of data, and still less the ability to store it. 
This mechanism should only cover some signals entrants per second, and react to them. 
There is no need to store and respond to intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. in this way, he only uses a few dozen kilo-octets of memory in continues. 
There is no need for a memory of a capacity of gigabits, or even octets defenders. 
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the instant avoidance. to the estimates of Nissan, this system will make its entry in cars manufactured in series in the next ten years. 
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide drivers to their destination by avoiding obstacles in his way. 
It has even given a name to the baby overpriced. 
The written version of the economic rescue plan of 700 billion dollars, to buy back the dubious loans of banks, and to use in several times, is ready. 
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent. 
Reuters announced that during new debates even until after midnight local time Saturday, on the east coast, the leaders of Congress reached agreement on the controversy that has been in existence for days and days, around the rescue plan for a total of 700 billion dollars. 
"We have taken a significant step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic chairman of the US House of Representatives, after which we can only translate agreements on paper. 
The compromise, born out of the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
US Secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, said when commenting on the results of the compromise that the programme will work and will be effective, but more needs to be implemented. according to Pelosi, there is no question here of the rescue of Wall Street, but to make the wheels of the economy turning in the other direction. 
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, on Sunday night at 20h (Washington local time Monday at 2h in the morning, according to the local time of Central), but has not caused spectacular rise in the stock exchanges. 
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill responding on behalf of law of emergency economic stabilization in the year 2008. secondly, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate. 
Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then, the White House has also welcomed the news of the agreement. 
"We are satisfied with the progress achieved over night, and we are very appreciative of the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, a spokesman for the White House. 
Moreover, the programme differs from the original proposal made by the Bush administration, which she stated that the 700 billion dollars would be spent at once, for the purchase of securities on dubious loans. 
From now on, maximum half the sum of 700 billion can be spent. the first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by Congress, probably Monday. this first amount will the Treasury Secretary to buy banks' bad loans, while the use of extra USD 100 billion will be left to the discretion of the President. 
The programme will be overseen by an independent body, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will take part as well. 
The cost of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress. 
Under the law, the secretariat of the Treasury will set up a combined strategy: it can, at the same time, purchase of bad loans, securities and mortgages on dubious mortgages and other types of claims "toxic." 
The people in charge of the ministry said that the takeovers can take place within the framework of an auction, but also directly. 
The rule allows companies involved, to take part in a programme of insurance, where the secretariat of the Treasury provides the tools to the origin of the concerns, for which companies have paid a premium equivalent to damage predictable. 
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary tools in order to devote $700 billion dollars for the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it be the broad buying dubious claims to their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system leading to the collapse of a major financial institution or another. 
"We shall take the necessary measures, to be ready for the application of the law, as soon as it will be signed," he added. 
However, the leaders of the banks in bad stances and waiting for help from the state can expect their redundancy payments, called simply golden parachute lands across the Atlantic, will be capped by the government. 
The capping salaries is mentioned only in the specific case. moreover, the restrictions depend on how the secretariat of the Treasury proposes its assistance to the company. 
The principle of capping means that if the secretariat of the Treasury is buying up within the framework of an auction, they prélèveront a surplus of taxes on the golden parachute lands, unless the president of bank discredited based in retirement. 
Directly after the takeover of bad loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders should not be exaggerated. 
So that the image was complete, we must say that the existing sector parachutes are not modified. the ceiling is that the new contracts, to motivate and participation in the plan. 
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in force regarding the allowances of the Directors-General - has commented on the chairman of the committee on financial services of the Chamber of Deputies, the Democrat Barney Frank. 
In addition, the state has a right to acquire shares in banks participating in the plan. in this way, the risk of taxpayers is decreasing, since they can even be winners in the matter as soon as the economy, and with it the banks saved will rebound on their legs. 
The bill states that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal which will rule on how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector. 
On both sides, there were, of course, those who have expressed their doubts about the plan. 
This does not mean that US citizens have mandated, this does not protect the taxpayers' dollars, said the deputy Darrell Issa, Republican of California. 
His colleague, Democrat of Ohio, Mary Kaptur think they were the ones who are urging the taking of measures, that those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street. 
Prices have continued to increase industrial 
In August 2008, the price of domestic industrial sales rose by 0.1% compared to the previous month and 12.9% compared to the August 2007 - communicates the Office of the Central Statistique of Hungary. 
Industrial sales prices for export rose by 1.1% compared to those of July 2008, while compared to those of a year earlier, they fell by 3.9%. 
As a result of the domestic price fluctuations and for export, prices, industrial production rose by 0.7% compared to those of the previous month, and 3.2% compared to those of the previous year. 
Domestic industrial sales prices have risen only to a lesser extent, by 0.1%, compared to the previous month. 
Domestic sales prices for the processing industry have suffered only a small increase of 0.1% from July.

After negotiations marathons that have lasted for days and days, the representatives in Congress and the administration have finally announced Sunday at dawn, they have reached agreements in principle on the plan to rescue the banks. 
This financing plan in order to thaw in the crisis of Wall Street and the credit market paralysed, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign. 
McCain and Obama like everyone, are even better than the other, to lead the country out of economic crisis. 
According to the latest polls, promotes economic issues, Obama has once again managed to procure a little further. the advance of McCain, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as his running mate shook up right after the Republican convention, has melted.

The press cuttings of the German language area 
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that the voters have become more aware - as mentioned Der Spiegel, the low score of the Bavarian CSU in the country. 
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of the red and black. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.) (a) 
In the Internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter the causes of the defeat dramatic CSU in his article entitled "the revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers." 
According to this political scientist acknowledged, the erosion of the CSU started before the sad duo Beckstein, Huber takes office. 
Christian Socialists have transformed the Bavaria for decades and now, it is these very citizens modern they turn their back on us. 
This change of time is at the same time the problem of any Christian democracy, and also that of Angela Merker. 
For the CSU, the failure was not entirely a surprise, but on Sunday, came to end a process that was likely to it, just ten years ago: the National Party's unquestioned hegemony was completed. 
In ten years, in 1998, the CSU is ramassait with 47,7%, and for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the level of 50%. 
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections of 2005, when the invoked so often Stoiber. 
The cause can be attributed to the modernisation "devouring his parents, which was set up in the region in a way consistent with the CSU. 
It is 40 years that sociologists announcing it but they have been misled about the pace. however secularization, the results of education and the establishment of German from the north and east in the region of Bavaria, in full development, could not be imposed on the loyalty of voters CSU. 
Modernisation goes hand in hand with the increase in opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible. 
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that the voters have become more aware, more critical and more entêtés. 
It is amazing that in recent weeks, this is precisely the traditional groups of citizens who are rather far from the CSU, such as the self-employed, artisans, holders of the box and the graduates of higher education. 
In these groups, support for the CSU has fallen below 40%. 
Die Presse - (diepresse.) (COM) 
In his article entitled "who?" 'with whom? "the party chairman will be on the reserve with the issues of the coalition," the conservative Austrian newspaper is dealing with the situation of the domestic political confusion that has arisen after the Austrian elections. 
The Austrian Socialists comprising the SPÃ wish to discuss with the conservatives in the ÃVP. 
The ÃVP prohibits the SPÃ to meddle in its internal affairs. 
The populist party BZÖ is open to negotiations. the Greens do not want to reach agreement on the coalition. 
The elections were held now, everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates held on state television, party leaders have barely be seen their cards. 
Werner, the chairman Faymann SPÃ, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the ÃVP. 
The SPÃ wants to show that the cooperation of the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in some regions and in the partnership socialist. 
The question that we imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Mr. Molter, the current president of the ÃVP, as Vice-Chancellor and remains open from Faymann. 
As he said, the direction Schüssel - Mr. Molter was, in any case, rejected. 
A replica of this combination is out of the question. 
Mr. Molter reacted cautiously to the proposals of the red. 
As he has already said, cooperation will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann try to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÃVP. 
In his party, the choice of opposition or join the coalition is temporarily a matter entirely open. these points must be debated within the ÃVP. 
Jörg Haider, the chairman of the BZÖ, is once again open to all proposals. 
"In order to avoid the coalition of the red and black, we are ready to assume the responsibilities of government," said Haider. 
Lívia Járóka said: we must break the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation 
Today, began in Paris, the European summit for Equal Opportunities, whose host is France, as representative of the current presidency of the European Union. 
In his message presentation in the plenary, as one of the main spokesmen hearing experts, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, has drawn attention to segregation in education, because it is a violation of the law affecting the Roma children and this fact, one of the main obstacles to their success in life. 
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Sociales affairs, and on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner in charge of the work, social affairs and equal opportunities. 
Among those invited to take part in the consultation, we find the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of the legal protection and civilian agencies in Europe, in the field of equal opportunities. 
According to the press office of the Group of the People's Party, Járóka Fidesz MP warned that alongside distinctions in the recruitment, Roma disappear from the labour market, in the first place, following their poor qualifications. 
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have secondary degrees, and as a result of an elementary education to poor quality, only a tiny fraction has the opportunity to obtain a master's degree in higher education." 
Furthermore, Járóka has insisted that education as a fundamental right of human beings plays a key role when we must assert the other fundamental rights. 
Investment in early education of Roma children means a strengthening of the economies of the Member States of the European Union. 
According to the MEP, it is necessary to be aware of these reports in a circle the widest possible, also among the Roma and the not - Roma. 
Indeed, the sooner a Roma child starts school, the more it increases its chances to become a productive member of the labour market; by the taxes paid on the basis of his income and consumption, it is part of the state budget. 
"Because of their nationality of the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to a quality education, and be protected from sectarian and low quality education." - stressed Lívia Járóka. 
According to the lady, a collaboration of the European Union geared towards a goal and an action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of desegregation of schools. for that, compliance with the existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of paramount importance. 
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and the unemployed." "we must give the opportunities provided by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe," which demanded Járóka. 
On behalf of the "European Year of Equal Chances" guaranteed to all, the objective of the summit for equality in Europe held every year since the summit in Berlin last year, is to ensure a unique platform to support the measures taken in favour of equal opportunities and the fight against discrimination, targeted at European level and at the level of the Member States. 
CSU: thanks for a period of transition 
It was in October that the decision on the fate of the duo lost Huber - Beckstein 
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, heads are not yet fallen, and the debate on the issues to the top of the Bavarian CSU has been postponed. 
The chairman of the party, Erwin Hube and the leader of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place; the question is: how long will the pardon? 
The fate of the duo, who have suffered a loss of voice catastrophic of 17%, will be on the agenda of the extraordinary party congress, held the last weekend of October. 
The members of the pair's much-criticised have, in any case, felt that they did not specifically to their seats. 
Thanks to this, they have sought to soothe the angry members of the group and the base, which a day after the Bavarian "tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of an absolute majority. 
In five years, it is true, even under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the peak of his career - Christian social and union gained 60.7%, whereas today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, there are only 43.4% of their strength. 
For 46 years, the CSU has been the single "sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18% of its GDP. 
However, the Conservatives have always strongly in this region in the south, of key importance to the Hungarian economy. in the future, they will be forced to the coalition. 
As one of the first signs of an internal readjustment of the party, the Vice-President and the federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer, presented as a possible successor to Huber was also given a place in this small group of recognition, who instigate discussions to tâtons with liberals the Free Democrats, as well as with the Electeurs Universities, along the values of right, about a possible coalition government in Munich. 
A mockery strange fate was that with the help of the list of Electeurs Universities, enacted into law the Gabriele Pauli, taking a position against Stroiber served as the possibility of coup carried out by the duo Huber, Beckstein, and then deal with bluntly the very ambitious woman local authority politics. 
Now, the leaders of the CSU put all their energies on stabilising, one way or another, Beckstein. 
In this transition, Stoiber, who until now were the behind the scenes, should also receive an active role. the former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, appointed on 28 September as the day the most bitter of his political career. 
On Monday, Huber has launched some incisive observations to the CDU. according to him, they should have received much greater support from the party brother. 
Other politicians CSU have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel. 
Following the elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will again be Chancellor that if they jeopardise up one way or another, with a joint force, the CSU, who played a significant role in the national success in 2005. 
According to Merkel, hard to hide his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of ground of the CSU will not adversely the grand coalition in Berlin. 
What is concerning because it will be easier to manage the CSU injured, and the crisis of socialists lasts forever. 
Since 1946, the SPD has reached its worst results with 18.6% in Bavaria. 
- Lukasenko his rivals: 110 - 0 
No Member of the opposition has acceded to the Belarus parliament after Sunday's elections. 
According to the Russian monitors, this is due to a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, who ensure prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it is because of illegalities committed during the count the votes. 
The OSCE, who sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognise the elections. 
Although the legislature composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million people, is a very happy of opposition for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the United Self-Defense Forces (ODSZ) hoped Démocratiques seriously that Lukashenko, renewing his mandate as chairman for the fourth time in Elections, following the amendment of the constitution in 2006, "would" this time the presence of some Members of the opposition in parliament. 
In that way, the ODSZ has relinquished its boycotts intended. 
The fact that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would improve its relations with the EU, where because of the political order termed undemocratic Belarus, Lukashenko and several senior politicians do not receive entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition, Belarus has taken credit for the drop in imports of Russian natural gas, always more expensive, and thus contributed to the passage of the company Beltransgaz, owner of gas shipped across the country, is in the hands of the past Russian. 
The fact that the OSCE, in the assessment of the campaign, has put the emphasis on the positive changes rather than on the shortcomings, such as the ban to stand for a third of the candidates for the opposition, was referring to an appeasement. 
However, the press release of the OSCE on Monday already was disputed by the campaign, during which most of the candidates for the opposition could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present at the count the votes. 
Despite all this, the opposition feels nonetheless palpable improvement in the political system: the political detainees have regained the freedom, and Minsk is ready to small confrontation with Moscow, which is still refusing to recognise South Ossetia and the Abazzia separated from Georgia. yet Russia with which the Belarus form a confederation on paper, consider the two independent territories for a month. 
"We took two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue was initiated between Belarus and the EU," said Alexander Milinkevich to our newspaper. 
According to the candidate for the opposition of the presidential elections of 2006, it is desirable that it should stay, despite the fact that "the power has been afraid in this parliament which has no weight to get even a single opponent." 
The opposition does not provide for actions of protests in view of the results. it is trying instead to get its message on the need for economic reform to the voters. 
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this front: we have to give our newspapers opponents in Russia, local authorities put up obstacles on the dissemination, but I can see that they are increasingly to support the elections, even in the circle of elderly," said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenko, who considers social security as its main outcome, the ozone pensioners most supported officially no longer regard it really as appropriate. 
"Because of the indebtedness of the country and the rising trade deficit, the collapse of the social security," evoking the silence of a graveyard, "is just a matter of time," says Milinkevich. 
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic. 
Sergei Lebedev, leader of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in deeds.". in this way, the absence of the opposition is proof of the maturity of the Belarussian voters. 
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before the work." 
Never in history Chigi Palace, had been revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees. 
But d 'today, is in force this new measure against the crafty, against which then goes ahead and drink coffee at the bar during working hours. 
The new anti- layabouts was presented today by the Minister of Administration Publique, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi. 
"The revolving doors - tells Brunetta - are an instrument for better work, with more productivity, more attendance and more services," says the Minister. " 
Now starts a new season of responsibility and transparency. 
"This is the reformism" also emphasises Brunetta. 
The installation in all the institutions of the presidency of the Council is complete with the Palais Chigi. 
According to Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is important even a symbolic point of view." 
No resistance on the part of the employees have been detected, ensures the Secretary-General: "This is a process shared by employees, and we had the cooperation of all." 
In short, over breakfast during working hours, more than coffee or growing. 
Promise of Brunetta, which suggests smile, "a good 7h cappuccino in the morning is a very good and healthy resolution." 
At a conference at the School of Public Administration Supérieure 
In Rome, the minister noted that "in three months, the absence of disease public employees has been reduced by 50%, or 60milles workers more in a year." 
And he adds that it is necessary to make it more effective, the Administration Publique. 
In Italy, "whose dynamic - explains the Minister - these 8 - 10 years have doubled in relation to the private sector, and well above the rate of inflation." 
At the same time, thousands of public employees, have joined together to challenge the standards of the decree Brunetta making use of the Codacons. 
"Whilst the Minister of Administration today projected Publique data relating to the reduction of absenteeism in the workplace illnesses - writing the association of consumers - the people of" active "lazy continues to increase. 
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of employees of the Administration Publique correct and productive, gathered to declare war on illegitimate standards contained in the decree. 
In particular, the Tar will dispute the exclusion of additional benefits in case of injury as a result of service; the extension of working hours of the worker domiciliaire always sick, during which are carried out the inspections, and other items from the new provisions sought by the minister. 
Accidents in the workplace, Napolitano: "Prevention is crucial." 
Every day, in Italy, there are 2500 accidents, 3 dead and 27 people who are disabled permanently. 
In 2007, the data Inail confirm, in fact, that the dead white were approximately 200. 
The figures indicate the seriousness of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and cause almost twice as many deaths as murder. 
For the attention of the institutions, the social forces and resources for information on this aspect, the dramatic Anmil famous today, in all the provinces, the Italian National Day 58ème for victims of accidents on the job, institutionalised the second Sunday of October. 
"The worrying information disseminated by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the issue of prevention in the workplace," says the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of the National Association of Anmil, mutilated and disabled work, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of state expresses its "sincere appreciation for the ongoing effort to break for prevention in the workplace, the protection of workers injured, assistance to the families of the victims and raising the awareness of public opinion" 
"Of course, everyone has struck down to put an end to such tragedies which, by their size, are the rest of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the reality of life have been tragic cases, even repetitive in their dynamic." 
Napolitano does not hide the fact that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is ECU to invest in training and information ' 
The many initiatives promoted in the school, attach particular importance to a more direct awareness on the part of young people in the world of work. 
It is our duty, to maintain the attention to this phenomenon, not in assessing the alarm about the seriousness of social, apply and improve legislative standards. 
For its part, the chairman of the House Gianfranco Fini stressed on how "the phenomenon of dead white is an absolute social emergency, which insult the conscience of all of us, and imposes on all the institutions, to make a concrete effort aimed at ending soon." 
The data of accident on the work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of dead white is impressive, "said later the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli." 
"We do not want this" trend downwards'is translated into fact, into a minor attention, because it is precisely when attention is acquittal, that is the tragedy.' 
"We believe that, in general, it is not enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be achieved through many actions." 
"In our view, stressed Mercandelli - more controls and inspections are necessary, as a more important on the training of workers, and this, from school. 
- He added, "we must make an effort with regard to the communication and awareness of public opinion." 
"But we must, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers faced with a phenomenon which is a social emergency." 
"Mercandelli then denounced" the gradual deterioration of the conditions of compensation for the victims of work 'and the' drift of assistance to which the system is moving in recent years. " 
"The aim, therefore, is to give the employee the guarantee of assurance - he said - so that the fate of someone who has an accident, must not depend on the spontanéisme or enlargement of the legislator." 
Mp3 reader pointed out they put at risk the hearing. 
To listen to music at full volume for a prolonged period using equipment such as portable music players Mp3, can cause permanent damage to the hearing. 
That is what the European Commission, which, in a statement released in Brussels, quote the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the health risks Csrseri unplanned and recently identified (EU), published today. 
"This scientific report - we read in the paper, it appears that 5 - 10% of those who, during a period of at least 5 years, listening to music on full volume using portable music devices, for more than an hour a day per week, face a permanent loss of hearing ability. ' 
"I am concerned about the fact that such a large number of young people who use frequently of portable music devices and mobile phones at full volume, can damage unconsciously their hearing an irreparable" says Meglena Kuneva. 
"According to the scientific data - pursues the responsible Ue - this is a clear risk and we must respond quickly. 
What matters most is to raise awareness among consumers and make the information public domain. 
We need to review the existing control systems in view of the scientific opinion, so that they can be fully effective and can follow new technologies " 
Brussels has asked the Scientific independent, to look into the matter, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise that they generate. 
"Scientists, concluded the executive Ue, confirm that there is good reason to be concerned, and that the European Commission will examine now with the Member States and other interested parties, what action could be possibly taken to better protect children and adolescents, against exposure to noise from similar devices and portable music devices." 
There is already a European standard of safety that limits the level of noise 100Db portable music devices, but the concern is growing about the hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise. 
It is possible to limit these data making use of solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure to noise. 
The Scientific Ue pointed out that users of portable music devices, which are listening to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for five hours per week are currently in force on the level of noise maximum made in the workplace. 
Those who are listening to music in such conditions for prolonged periods, risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years. 
There is interest in 5 - 10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU 
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to leave the Commission for the future of the capital. 
Today we start in March we conclude, in June we will get the money back. 
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the future of Rome Capital ", which took place this morning, the new seat, behind the Thermes of Caracalla. 
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other components of the Commission will the directives for Rome. 
In March when they have completed, the Committee and the local council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so as to present in June, the strategic plan for Rome with the stamp "official" on Capitol Hill and its mayor Gianni Alemanno. 
"The committee is totally independent, and all the political, social and cultural ideas are represented - wants to emphasise Alemanno - it will have to propose ideas for development of Rome, which can use policy makers, which remain the Committee and the local council. 
No overlapping of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where a major project for Rome. 
In March, it completes its tasks and then disappear, because this experience must have a specific time period. 
In June - announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan from the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. " 
For those who accuse the Commission to be unnecessary, given that his opinions are binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, and the quality of its proposals." 
If the quality is there, as in France thanks to the Commission Attali, as elsewhere in Rome, I am on, his contribution will be fundamental. 
Too often the policy is frustrated by the management of the newspaper and emergencies that occur from time to time. 
We, on the contrary, we want to see progress, and further, into a deeper perspective, working seriously to the development of Rome and its future. " 
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "the Commission is not a useless body or a whole bureaucratic: it is absolutely free, and will not cost another euro to Roman city dwellers, and will study and get the best intelligence which express the Capital." 
For Alemanno, indeed, "we need a skeleton key reference, neither firm nor immobile, in order to enable our city to improve what they absolutely need, while thinking of his future now a spirit of unity,". 
A future which, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual municipal borders, but which takes a further" not only in view of the future in metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital, "but also for the role that Rome can and must be, as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean." 
Obama? the first anti-American president. that is why. 
A famous American politician who wants to be independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second president anti-American." 
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, in both its decisions, destroyed the economy US and were reports (as well as how it has always today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam. " 
The attack on Obama increase as the date of the elections is drawing nearer. 
A lady of Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition." 
Obama is really rich: he believes it will garner the highest office of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five senators black! " 
In fact, it is about attacks that do say very little; they are obviously of racially motivated attacks, and do not respond to the question of all voters: will it be a good President? we have furthermore polls, all of whom say that Obama the winner and with a good advantage. 
In this case, it is also about someone who speaks from the heart and not with the brain. 
A newspaper in the Mississipi sandpits, in the southern US, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot will give its vote. 
This is that one aspect of the American mindset kept secret until the end. 
"Say what you want, we will see we even put the cross on Obama or on McCain." 
They are the same people who swear that if Obama wins, we leave the United States. 
Things never disclosed until now, so much so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain. 
In any case, despite all these arguments, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush. 
Asked about 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term? 89% replied: Iraq. 
America is changing. 
In Vietnam, this nation has lost 50 miles soldiers and was sent back home to the fesses. 
In Iraq, 500 soldiers have lost their lives, and the Americans have not been forced to make the suitcases. 
Despite this, Iraq has been, for the most part, the point of weakness for Bush. 
Who will take the place of George W will have an enormous stain to perform. 
The Usa economic debacle, is felt even among journalists: in the press, this is a time for deletions and many blame the Internet, "this killing," the paper newspaper. 
Five hundred American journalists have been arrested by the PEW Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control for the future. 
Well, almost all the journalists today are pessimistic about their future. 
However, they have not stated openly to the attached information, feel less concerned about credibility. 
They do not feel isolated as ever. 
The problem of American journalists, it is the money, the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of destroying economic model. 
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the authors work at the assembly of newspapers, are a big problem. 
This is a problem that must be addressed, according to journalists interviewed, if we are to see the traditional media reporting, such as the general public, will be reduced accordingly. 
A clear but complex pessimism pervades American journalism. 
Six out of ten senior executives and journalists from newspapers print are convinced that journalism at national level is in the process of going the wrong way. 
Locally, the group's executive is to 65%. 
Publication printed against broadcast. 
Reporters are not hard to see where goes the Web. 
The biggest houses éditrices is making its transition to the Internet, perceived by many as "the murderer 'paper newspaper. 
"Economic pressure" that feel journalists is increased up to 79%. 
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to put technology hoping that it "to do something good for their journalism." 
Today, the hitch the largest in American journalism lies between who run the newsrooms, the directors and reporters who work for them. 
56% of directors at national level, are convinced that reporters share their values, while at local level, that percentage drops to 23%. 
For some, this is linked to the "safety at work." 
The managers who lose their jobs in the space of three years, are 47% at national level. 
As far as journalists, we are going to 30%. 
The "at" safe working staff (our authors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda. 
Only 13% of journalists are working under contract. 
In a nation immense as the Usa, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often provide what they want, and that is fast becoming a question of take or leave it. 
The managers receive almost always big salaries, while the editor can win 10mille dollars per month, in addition to retirement and the payment of insurance. 
As for the holidays, the logic is simple: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, past a number of years. 
But, according to their revelations, American journalists, are often "sick" during the year. 
It is the fault of the climate. 
Unipol: court Rome, Danilo Coppola remains to Grottaferrata. 
The president of the second section of the criminal court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the authority of the estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to leave the city, Grottaferrata, for a home in Rome. 
. Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy within the framework of the instruction on the escalation Unipol - Bnl. 
During the trial against him last week, he had obtained the release domiciliaire transformed into obligatory residence in Grottaferrata. 
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the estate agent can go down the route of the city in a home in the capital. 
According to the court, such movements (that the token has not granted) would allow him to influence its society and to have access to the evidence which accuse. 
The elites in danger. 
The phenomenon had already shown a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the rescue plan of 700 billion dollars approved by the White House: a significant number of American was, and still is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than to save the US economy. 
And that is the New York Times yesterday who confirms it disquieting that the current crisis is dividing the Republican Party, even more divided between its eve soul East Coast, moderate, in favour of federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, opposed to 'those in Washington "and to the world of finance, powerful, especially in the countries of Central and South. 
The soul, who has made itself felt in a despotic with the vote which I spoke at the beginning. 
But what has just been mentioned is just one example of the changes, big changes that the earthquake ongoing economic pre-announcement or leaves already run: not only in the United States, but in all the West, and can be not only than here. 
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the couvés phenomena for some time, so much so that, in the new climate, they solidifient and turn out. 
The first of these phenomena is the update, relaunch extraordinary, double category - state sovereign, compared to a sort of renationalisation of the economy. 
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking institutions, which have, of course of close relations with other countries, but which, above all, involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families who live in one country, in a single state. 
This creates a political problem for governing them: in other words, as to respond to the difficulties and the protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate. 
In short, the crisis is economically but politically, it is almost here. 
The internationalisation policy seems really out of the game or well, had little to say: the evidence is provided by the European Union, which, as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, came to decide no common policy line. 
And thus, it is the government of each state that all await the speeches, the rescue and recovery plans, the new rules, and above all a love of money: when one is going through a difficult period, there is that the states that have the economic resources, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to put things in place. 
They also have the necessary resources and legitimacy to use: two invaluable resources, elements of which no market or international organisation can never be the same way. 
This new emphasis of the nation-state is in perfect harmony with the importance that the major still more recent economic developments in the economy tend to award a factor enough linked to this point: the territoriality. 
And, paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that they have now entered the realm of the network, technology ever more sophisticated, not material, convinced that the globalized finance was now seeking to dominate the world, we have learned of a coup of one, that our future will instead settle its accounts more with things rather little material such as water, harvest, oil. 
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the land, but are linked definitively to a limited area, in a territory. 
So, which is sovereign, has certainly more cards than anyone who is not, in other words, whoever has the misfortune to live in a place without harvesting, without oil and without water. 
I now turn to the second innovation which, however, provides a fracture. 
That said, called the state government, inevitably said Politics, and therefore Leadership. 
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two phenomena converge. 
On the one hand, the awareness of the need objective of authoritarian leadership, the search for someone who will take control of the situation. 
On the other hand, a wave of condemnation for the existing leaderships economic species that have proven to be inadequate and full of grey area. 
And furthermore, something even more profound, in a sense, even disturbing: a shadow, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of alienation which tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of areas of the West. 
So is once again increasing the belief of the various classes, before that actions are the same ideas of social elites until now to their height, their way to listen and to be, their culture in the acceptance of the complicated term, to have the same time, and to be still more foreign to the opinions of majorities. 
In short, The request of leadership, has become a powerful and more ramified underground, a délégitimassions movement classes and traditional political orders, which are in the "revolt" electoral impromptu or, in the collective mood changes of recent very recently, from the rise in Austria conservative Bavaria, in the fall of Labour in Britain, to the American delegates of rebellion against Bush (and it may be that the victory of the right in Italy is not arrived by chance). 
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their intellectual accredited, their format, sounds like someone, have more difficulty, which is not new, to understand and, therefore, to represent the deeper layers of the western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and wave potentially too much. 
In view of all this talk of a mass rebellion "present" on the agenda, seems frankly exaggerated. 
But they say well, keep our eyes wide open, it is not without reason. 
The supercolle to walk on the walls. 
Defeating the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and, in the future, walking on the walls like Spiderman. 
That is the objective of various American research centres, and today, a team of four institutes have almost succeeds. 
Always be removed with a barely 2.5 square centimetres, the scientists have managed to maintain stuck a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall. 
The study, the US journal Science published the findings of some researchers of the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is a development of those that we know who use a particular structure nano tubes, called carbon emissions. 
"The principle of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes prepared as a stack of spaghetti." explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
Scientists were inspired by their legs of geckos, covered in microscopic hairs that will ensure the animal, a perfect adhérente. 
The testing of various materials, such as the glass, the Téflon and paper, glass, have demonstrated that the new be removed is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it "too easily to the walls," explains Liming Dai groups, researcher in the Faculty of Ingénierie of the University of Dayton. " 
Walking on walls? - "this material could be used as temporary be removed" adds Liming Dai. 
Can be to walk on the walls as Spiderman? can be that, yes, but researchers think to use much less compelling as the connection between electronic appliances, given that the nano tubes of carbon are drivers of heat and electricity. 
Other applications could include aerospace engineering. 
For now, no super hero. 
The other research - the University of Berkeley, California, to condemn it as, in search of a new be removed. 
In an article in the American periodical American Chemical Society, have presented a Californian researchers trained to be removed microfibres as hair, which itself has to clean the dust during the movement on a surface area to ensure a perfect and constant grip. 
Drugs: never with of fruit juices. 
Attention to pamplemousse juice, orange and apple. 
These drinks, consumed most of the summer because désaltérantes and rich in vitamins, if combined with some vital medicines, to alter the absorbement precisely or in some cases, reducing their effectiveness, with very serious consequences for health. 
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, points out the risks of fruit juices, they may be, in cans or costs, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236ème national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm: a glass of orange juice, pamplemousse and apples, to reduce the number of absorbement vital medicines, overturning their beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of the patients. 
The pamplemousse juice has been strongly criticised because held accountable to increase the effects of certain medicines, antibiotics and tranquillizers arythmiques anti-, anti- stem and neurological, toxic levels. 
Drugs at risk - that is the Italian Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products itself, which had given the news in a newsletter dated two years ago, they warned doctors and patients not in assessing the danger stemming from this mix and to pay attention to what we drink, if we take medicines such as, for example, the Diazépam or the Méthadone. 
Not that the pamplemousse - according to the experts, even the orange juice and apple contains substances that inhibit the drugs. 
There is a long list of agents inhibited by the pamplemousse and other juice. 
Hence, the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the University of Milan Publique: "These findings are in general, immediately reported to the various national and international agencies of medicines to the need to change the notes informative medicines." 
We should always read the papers provide citizens with medicines that you take, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist 'stressed the expert to the Ansa agency. " 
The winner of the economy to Paul Krugman. 
The economy of the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on the models of trade and on the location of economic activities. 
Krugman, 55 years old, is a kind of Keynesian, who teaches at the University of Princeton and it is also a famous writer of the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the greatest criticism solutions in economy and foreign policy of the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, during the days of the bankruptcy of Enron, Krugman wrote in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States. 
A forecast which unleashed many controversies, and danger to the economist for years, but which now has proved accurate. 
"I am surprised and even a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom, have disappeared from the public," said Krugman at the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an economist of great value, "but also a divulgateur style" very aggressive, particularly critical of the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration. " 
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "package against Microsoft." 
This is the day of the distribution of OpenOffice. org. 3. 0, the open source of personal productivity which aims to reach always and still more users, home to the office, professionals in public administration, proposing a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office. 
Following a work of almost a year, done by volunteers, patrolled by developers SUN Microsystem, the new package Open Office is the public with a variety of new features: the welcome screen, and the interface reviewed and become less crude, to other more important, as the compatibility born for the system opératif Apple Mac OS X, and support for the new Open Document Format (ODF format) 1.2, the latest version ISO standard. 
Open Office gave particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft,.docx (.) (xlsx, pptx (.)). 
Also interesting, some specific function to some modules, such as reducing the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful, for example, to send them by Email, or PDF file to import in the module of drafting disc, keeping the original aspect of the page. 
Still on this front, it is possible to create PDF documents "hybrid" between the graph Adobe format is typical of the elements of a roadmap of calculation or a producer of text. 
Cooperation between several people is something that has had various improvements within applications: in the roadmap calculation, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on the changes in the draft texts, because each employee is given a color commentary for greater recognition in the review phase. 
Some companies are even working to induce certain functions of OpenOffice on the Web (the cloud, on the trail), and in the next few weeks, they should make the outcome final. 
The Italian version is déchargeable at http: / / it. openoffice. org / download / 3.0.0 / download300. htmlet and adds to the English version, which was on the mirror since Friday. 
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the result is as usual available in addition to the system opératif Linux. 
On request, the cd of installation can be whipped at home or the workplace. 
And if the subject of free may be one way to disseminate in houses, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office following is the great challenge, which can already count on various projects in public administration and schools. 
Not to mention the realities which offer a service training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also be open to the vanguard of business. 
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, writing for the video equivalent of Word; Calc calculation, is the roadmap which aims to replace spreadsheet; Impress, a rival of PowerPoint for presentations; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the programme which allows us to work on the databases; finally Drwa module is the graphic. 
Objective for 2008, reaching 5 million download, and considering that today there are nearly 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the exit of the new version, it may even exceed the planned figure 
Kohl, is positive, it is the fourth case of doping. 
New case positive tone to the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian of team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber. 
This is the site of the daily L'Ãquipe reporting the news. 
In 26ans, Kohl is the fourth cyclist positive Cera Epo, the third generation, after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner. 
Blood tests carried out on the éprouvettes Kohl are part of ones made in recent weeks, by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay - Malabry. 
If the against analyses confirm the positive tone at Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and will forcement expected two years of elimination. 
The news of the positive tone of Kohl to Epo of third generation, was confirmed by the head of the French anti- doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the positive tone to the Austrian authorities. 
The Austrian 26ans has placed on the platform behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and America's Cadel Evans, raflant peas and the jersey for best climber. 
Immigrants: New York Times wonders if Italy is racist? 
Italy "as a country of immigrants has recently transformed into a privileged destination for immigrants" met with resistance. 
It would make it the Beau country in a nation of racists? it is intéroge the New York Times who devoted a long article discussing the issue of racism in Italy, working on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of biscuits. 
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time where we are "more integration and more work," but also "a strong anti-immigration feeling most of the country and the most important support to the Lega Nord" 
To confirm the increasing tension between the Italians and immigrants, the NYT has also refers to episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
Not only. 
Even the new term sought by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the return of illegal immigrants, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy. 
Trend underlined by the Pope and by the President of the Republic, "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, requested that the state and church work together to defeat racism." 
Students who are victims of rent expensive, up to 900 euros for a chamber. 
The market try for students knows no crisis 
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the union of tenants, renting a room in a student simple can cost up to 900 euro to Milan, 650 to 700 in Florence, Naples, 600 in Rome. 
"The phenomenon has now reached the point very serious aspects to exclude entire groups of young people, the right to the study because of the total costs are very high that the families of origin must support - explains the head of the office of studies of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities, the strong demand on the part of students has so distorted the market that a process of widespread increase has amorcémême for residents." 
In most cases, the offers rental also includes a series of violations: contracts free, untaped without limit of rent, sous-locations. 
For the extraordinary interventions, Sunia through the revision of taxation, are necessary to calm prices. 
I read in detail the investigation, we see that in Milan, on a bed in the zone Brianza, around 450 euros; for a simple chamber, we will at least EUR 650 (area of Gaza Nere), to an average of 800 (area Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (area Vittoria) 
In Florence, a bed costs on average, 350 / 400 euros, a chamber about 700 euros. 
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas close to the University, 250 / 280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a simple. 
In Rome, in the areas close to universities plants (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), around 600 euros for a simple, 450 to a bed in a double. 
Values slightly lower (550 euro for a simple) for the areas close to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
We cannot save that if people living in peripheral areas: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a simple in the area Predestina, Centocelle or similar. 
At Naples, for a bed we need 300 / 400 euros, for a simple, it spends 400 to 600, with prices higher in the areas, and Vomero Policlinico, Colli Aminei. 
At Bari for bed, there are 250 / 350 euros, at least 350 for a simple. 
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major part of the economy in cities. 
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which the try are often taken by students from outside the Community, there is a further anomaly: the rent asked foreign students is plus 25 / 30% compared to the one applied to the Italians. 
Bye old cinema Paradiso, cities éliment historic rooms. 
The historical cinemas are closing in favour of Multiplex. 
"A city without cinemas is a blind city is like a face without eyes." 
The picture presented by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, exemplifies what is happening in the major urban centres Italian, but also in the cities of the province, 
The process of marginalization cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of big multisalles, and the death of consomption of mono rooms in central areas of cities, is one of the major events which we believe is inevitable and undeniable; it has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime. 
To disappear, it is often the historic places and responsible for memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone known, with whom we shared a lot of mileage and so many emotions," observed the orchestrator of the Nuovo Paradiso movie, film that gives Tornatore there 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prize in Cannes, and jurée telling the poetry of a province, and the nostalgia for a way to live the cinema, lost can be forever. 
The figures provided by the association, Anec main traders, want all say: these past five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and these are the rooms of the main cities who have paid the price: 10 less in Florence, 9 to Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer to Turin, 5 and Palermo. 
Among the areas hardest hit by the closure, Emily Romaine is at the top with 82 cinemas mono rooms lost, followed by the Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41). 
The evidence that confirms t that primary responsibility for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, because the three Italian regions that have the most new cinemas multisalles: 195 screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as in Emilie-Romagne. 
"The Italian exploitation has developed an irrational" observed Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but we do need to ensure the survival of those that already exist, because when a firm room in a city, these fréquenteurs are not necessarily all prepared to go to the multiplex." 
Not to mention the deliberation missed of credit for traders: the debt antécédente state is approximately 10 million. 
It is shameful that, from a moral and étique point of view, the government does not respect the existing laws. 
To support the sector, it should be between 16 and 18 million per year. 
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city who, concerned by these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the mono cinema halls of historic centres and outlying regions. 
Among the planned legislation, there are measures of state tax in favour of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: viewers can enter the area to movement restricted, and will have special charges for the parking spaces and in some parking lots. 
"This is an initiative that appeals to me," observed Giuseppe Tornatore 'and I hope other cities will follow the example of Bologna putting in place other measures. " 
However, it is clear that, in contrast, the super power of the multiplex traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding. 
The defence of the traditional cinema is a topic which for me has always been important: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do 'new cinema Paradiso' which I thought I had already since 10ans. 
I live in Rome for the last 25 years, and when I go to the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have both lived on emotions shared, I turn to the other side not to see the signs noircis by dust. 
Links between politics and the 'ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro. " 
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to make the choice of the interests of the Mairie Piromalli clan." 
Heavy accusations made by the judges of the Directorate of Calabria, anti-Mafia towards the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external assistance for mafia association. 
The manettes also for Gioacchino Piromalli, former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his small son lawyer, namesake of the bosses, already sentenced for criminal association of Mafia type, and to pay 10 million. 
"An insult to the prescriptive legal and moral, and above all to the good sense 'write prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay for consultations to MaÃ®tre Piromalli. 
"And it would have been granted in the clan - write judges - to enter officially to the inside of the councils facilitating the possibilities, already considerable, control and orientement public administration." 
The chairman of the committee Agazio regional calabrais Loiero, does not hide the fact that "collusions between the local committees and organised crime, there are more of a 'in its region:" there are places where the intensity mafia is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable. " 
But there are also many politicians who resist pressure from the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest. " 
The arrests this morning follow those of July, during which the police have told the décapitée Piromalli clan. 
At the end of April, the City Council of Gioia Tauro, already had been dissolved in 1991, and always because of alleged conditions between organised crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of their duties to administer the City. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, was appointed head of a coalition of center-right, after the runoff in May 2006. 
He shouted to the scandal when the police ordered the dissolution of the City Council. 
It accusa vice interior minister at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing it of having manigancé everything for a political issue, but given the demand for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even manages to ask the variation of the project of the A3. 
Therefore Torrione interceptions ordered against Dal, the token write, is émergée "the availability to marry the requirements of a businessman, representative of a group more experienced, close to the Piromalli, standardising the choice of public administration in the interests of the clan." 
When energy is fueled waves, now the big head. 
This is a towering source which take up more than 70% of the surface of the planet and now the big global energy companies are finding this out. 
Waves, currents, tides, this is the new sources on which the behemoths such as Chevron have asked us, and now are trying to put their hands up. 
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea is being explored for now a hundred years ago, and in the 1970s, in competition with the first oil crisis, the research have intensified. 
When the price of oil, declined to 1980, the idea of exploiting energy navy was set aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase of oil give a great impetus to the sector 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London ruled in 2007, that 15% of the world need electricity could be covered by operating systems of the houle seas. 
This amount would be about twice the size that produce nuclear power plants. 
And in addition, there would be the currents and the tides. 
Behemoths in the attack. 
The first company to focus on marine energy was the Enersis, which in 2005, has siglé an agreement to build a plant in the north of Portugal. 
When the agreement was announced, we would have said a true not revolutionary. 
Two years ago, always more candidates among these enterprises doomed always to rely on traditional energy marine energy. 
"Chevron is currently studying the océanique energy technologies, said the spokesman for a US oil company associated with the colossus, the business daily Wall Street Journal - and evaluates the possibilities to cooperate with us." 
Cooperation in question, concerns a permit deliberated by the US Committee for energy necessary to give rise to a marine energy in Alaska. 
This is a very important sign, especially considering that precisely in Alaska, the Usa continue to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for further excavations 
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, who travel the path of energy from the sea, and there are large gaps until today, although their details are known, say observers, a growing interest. 
Tecnologie to point. 
The experts speak of a technology still in its infancy, from the fact that marine energy dispelling the fears about the environmental impact. 
At present, the systems such as those from Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not appear to create major problem in the ecosystem. 
To produce energy on a large scale, however, we must use technology with an environmental impact. 
"And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected." 
The surge of waves, which altered the sludge upwards and downwards, is turned into a hydraulic pressure of its cylinders and pistons inside the cork lines. 
The pressure spin a turbine, which in turn feeds a generator. 
Energy is sent to the shore through wires under sailors. 
For the moment, we have four systems of this kind in phase of project, in anticipation of a single federal approval and part of the energy could serve as a military installation. 
On the contrary, Verdant Power, already producing energy for a commercial centre and a marine park using six turbines in the East River in New York. 
The movement of water when the tides, runs the pales turbines, creating a generator powering a rotational movement. 
Having Verdant announced a long list of clients awaiting permits needed to tap energy. 
After waves, tides. 
A special interest, they say to the Institute for Research of electric power, deserves at the moment, the potential of tides. 
Although this is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable wind, the sun, and waves, and therefore more reliable as an energy source. 
And it is precisely on energy from tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, to look at the coast, have invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and provides investment up to 35 million in 2009.
