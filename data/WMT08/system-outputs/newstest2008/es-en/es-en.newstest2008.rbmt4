The European inflation slid on the food
The intensive inflation registered in the zone of euro, owes first of all to the vertiginous growth of the price of the foodstuff.
The increase of the prices in November has been superior to the waited in 13 countries of the zone of euro, registering - after 2.6 per cent of October - an annual inflation of 3,1 per cent - he announced the Office of Statistics of the Union with head office in Luxembourg.
The official forecasts only were giving as probable 3 per cent - announced the Bloomberg.
The Central Bank of Europe (BCE), in contrast to the issuing banks North American, Briton and Canadian, did not cut the basic interest, so pretext of which the decrease, together with the prices in increase of the prime matters and the reduction of the lay-off, they would provoke a spiral of inflation.
The BCE wants to support the valuation of inflation for below, but at least next to two per cent.
According to an analyst, the BCE finds in the pitfall 22: " it is necessary to negotiate " on the inflation so that later it does not have to intervene in this topic.
The inflation of 3.3 per cent, registered in Germany, beat the record of twelve years; while in Spain it increased of 3,6 4,1 per cent.
The inflation went off in the zone of euro as a consequence of the galloping nutritive and energy prices.
The quotations to term of the wheat increased in 88 per cent and also the quotation of the soya reached his maximum level from 1973.
Of equal way, it was necessary to pay much more in 2007 for the vegetable oil and for the milk products.
The raw oil price on the world market increased this year in 52 per cent, already reaching last month the black gold almost 100 dollars the barrel.
According to the BCE, the inflation in 2008 will jump from 2,1 current per cent to 2,5 per cent, on the other hand for 2009 it already will diminish 1,9.
According to the analysts, the annual inflation will be supported in the next 3 or 4 months about 3 per cent, nevertheless the average annual valuation will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, it is hoped that during the year 2008 the BCE should reduce two times the types of interest.
Gallup foresees a governmental crisis
After a long stagnation, by the beginning of December the support of the Alliance of Democratic Young people increased significantly, reaching his maximum level from 2002, while the Gallup earlier never experienced such a low level - 13 per cent - in case of the Socialists.
The difference in case of the sure electorate of the parties - due to the biggest steadfastness of the electorate of the opposition - would mean a support of more than two thirds (71 per cent) opposite to the support of a fifth part for the Socialists (20 per cent).
According to the poll, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of the Free Democrats would reach not even the necessary limit to have any parliamentary bench: his support inside the totality of the population is two per cent.
Between the sure electorate there is a some more one per cent of sympathizers in both edicts.
The economic ambience kept on deteriorating even compared to the previous rock bottom - it has never been so high, 41 per cent the proportion of those who considered to be especially the economic situation of the country bad, while another 46 per cent believe that the situation is quite bad.
The families, after the most encouraging spring expectations and of the summer, now are more pessimistic as for the change of his own economic situation.
As for next year, the majority of the population is provided with the deterioration of the situation and only a tenth part waits for an improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of the consulted ones, number superior to any previous poll of the Gallup, thought that the President of Government rather redeems badly that well his functions.
13 per cent of the consulted ones trust or trust very much in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán is provided with the support of 38 per cent of the consulted ones.
54 per cent of the population do not trust in the absolute thing in the Chief of Government and 27 per cent do not trust in the president of the Alliance of the Democratic Young people.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is of that, what proportion of the society thinks that it is possible to control the dissatisfaction experienced opposite to the person of the Chief of Government without a change of government.
Whereas after the disturbances of October of last year 35 per cent thought that it would be desirable to support in the power the Government and the Chief of Government, at present this proportion is of only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) believes that the only solution is the celebration of new elections.
The interest in the referendo is characterized by the fact that 60 per cent of the polled ones to the question on the participation answered that it would take part surely and another 20 per cent said that it is probable that it takes part.
To comparative way, in " a few general elections to be celebrated this Sunday " it would take part with safety only 55 per cent of the population and another 15 per cent believe probably his participation. By means of the current intentions of the electorate it does not fit doubts of the result of the popular consultation.
74 per cent of the population would disapprove the payment of the rights of studies, 79 per cent that of the service of medical consultations and 84 per cent that of the hospitable attentions.
If we observe these proportions only between the sure participants in the referendo, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the electorate would push back the introduction of the rights of studies, the payment for the medical consultations and that of the hospitable attentions.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled his prices
They supported the average increase of the level of the prices of 16 per cent the large supermarkets of the commercial triangle of gold of Budaörs, with the difference of which this year the VAT has not increased.
Article of Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased in an average of 16 per cent in the commercial triangle of gold of Budaörs the habitual basket of Christmas of the newspaper Napi, but in all the large supermarkets there registered a growth very superior to thousand HUF.
Since in December of last year the prices had already "gone off" in the food supermarkets, this way a drastic percentage increase was not experienced compared to the high starting point.
Nevertheless, clearly it is frightening for the consumers the fact that what last year there could buy at a price much underneath of nine thousand HUF, presently they cannot make it not for ten thousand.
The basket of Napi in the studied large supermarkets overcame with a minimum of 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the basket of higher value was 10 573 HUF.
(in the year 2003 this basket was costing 6800 HUF.)
The price of the liquor Unicum and of the fish it was supported almost in the level of the previous year, but there registered a strong increase of the fillet of breast of turkey, of the nut and of the seed of poppy.
The price of the flour of wheat and of the bread continued the information of the Central Office of Statistics, although in the Auchan we have found also one kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product at least of 200 HUF.
Equally it was surprising in this shop that the price of the Coca-Cola with redeemable bottle of two liters was costing less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, was costing only 257 HUF.
In spite of everything, in the basket of Napi Auchan it was the most expensive, while the cheapest Quarter.
According to our calculations, with regard to the prices of the Christmas of last year, Quarter increased with 15, while Tesco and Auchan with next to 18 per cent the prices that appear in the basket of Napi.
Comparing the values of the most expensive basket of last year with that of the cheapest basket of this year, the difference has been 12 per cent, while the growth between the cheapest of last year and the most expensive of this year it has been 21 per cent.
The average growth was of 1480 HUF.
Last year the average growth of the prices was of 1206 HUF, so that during the Christmas of last year in the prices one felt the increase of the VAT.
Exactly this process was the one that destroyed the commerce, the supermarkets visibly were unable to take decision about the margin of prices to apply for every product and to calculate the effect of the change of the prices on the consumption.
(If the merchant plans badly the speed of the circulation of a product, it can lose an important benefit in the margin that fits to the volume of selling.)
The increase of the price of the basket of Napi reached such ends as a consequence of the increase of the VAT, that the most expensive was superior with 1720 HUF to the value registered in 2006, whereas in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year such ends did not take place, since the price more high of now has been a 1630 HUF more than the last and cheapest year also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing two Christmas periods, a catastrophic growth registered in the prices in less than 20 months, in the large supermarkets there grew more than 30 per cent the price of the consumer goods of the first need.
(Nevertheless this not necessarily confirms the numbers of the Central Office of Statistics: this office, in case of some food of the first need it registered in the interval of 12 months an increase of price superior to 30 per cent.
This way for example, in addition to the wheat, also in case of the egg.)
According to the basket of Napi, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, since in the price of this product that was already quite expensive last year in comparison to the base, it registered, at the worst scarcely 10 per cent of increase of prices.
According to all the indexes, the suppliers of flour have a position stronger than those of egg, being able to impose the drastic increase of the prices even to the multinationals.
The large supermarkets do not complain in the commercial triangle of gold, speak constantly about positive results.
According to our quiet experiences, the majority of the consumers of three visited shops, already they are not interested in the prices.
Of all the products they buy big quantities, taking for palettes the preserved food.
On Wednesday morning, in three shops big tails formed ahead of the boxes because it increased suddenly the number of the clients.
Nevertheless, we have information of which inside the country the volumes of selling are low, numerous multinationals they complain to the institutes of poll because the income stays below his plans and not only in case of the food, but also in that of the electrical appliances.
In many hospitals it saves itself with the disinfectants
This year there have registered in the hospitals several thousands of infections produced first of all by the undue application of the antibiotics.
The reigning circumstances of hygiene in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds and the surcharge of the personnel do not favor the control of the infections - there affirms the doctor - chief of department of the National Center of Epidemiología.
In many hospitals it saves itself even with the disinfectants.
Not long ago a contagion has been diagnosed with MRSA in the department of traumatología of the Hospital János.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident there was detected the presence of the bacterium resistant to the antibiotics.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion took place in the same hospital at the beginning of the year.
To an injured man of a serious car accident they gave discharge of the hospital and the same patient soon should have returned to the hospital as a consequence of the contagion with MRSA and since then it was not possible to have realized an important surgical intervention for the presence of the bacterium in his organism.
Until December 10 of this year there have registered in the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance 1094 cases of hospitable infection produced by multiresistant agents - there said Karolina Böröcz, doctor - chief of department of the National Center of Epidemiología.
This means that in the hospitals with complete certainty there has registered this quantity of infections produced by multiresistant agents, of the rest information is not had.
Next to two third parts of the infections (683 cases) they owe to themselves the MRSA, that is to say to the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to the meticilina-oxacilina.
A third of the human beings take in his nose the bacterium of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) without causing any illness.
The infections produced by the SA (e.g.: inflammation of the gullet, tonsillitis, cutaneous infections, infections of wounds) react well to the antibiotics and they are of easy treatment.
Nevertheless, once it is applied exaggerated or unduly to the antibiotics, the bacteria that normally react well to the antibiotics, they transform in bacteria very resistant to the antibiotics and infect rapidly in hospitable inadequate conditions.
They can cause serious hospitable infections, for example infections of wounds or septicemia first of all to the patients with transitory or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with the flagging organism, to elders or to persons of little weight.
In opinion of the doctor - director of the Hospital János there is nothing special in the infection of the MRSA, these infections are daily in the hospitals.
It is not necessary to confuse the infection with the epidemic, the MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where his presence is not examined.
Resistant to the antibiotics
" These patients are isolated, the personnel of infirmary attends to them in rubber gloves and mask and the antibiotics adapted for his treatment exist " - Tibor Nyulasi said.
The hospitalized patients are examined previously to verify the presence of the MRSA in his organism, but at least this way it is not even possible to avoid the infection in all the cases.
There is not of fashion to take samples
It would be possible to prepare the hospitable infections of the MRSA in the majority of the cases, nevertheless the current hospitable national circumstances do not favor for the prevention of the formation and the contagion with the pathogenic multiresistant agents - Karolina Böröcz affirms.
As this infection takes place fundamentally in hospitals and old folks' homes, the hospitals should examine the hospitalized patients and isolate immediately to make ill that they go in his organism the MRSA.
Nevertheless, in the Hungarian hospitals the capture of microbiological samples is not of fashion.
This fact is due also to the fact that the National Box of Health does not finance these medical examinations.
So that the majority of the cases go out to the public light when there take place already the infections of the visible MRSA in the patient - there said the doctor - chief of department of the epidemiologic center.
The European Union does rigorous packages for the application of the antibiotics in the human medicine and national instructions exist also to treat the infections and pathological pictures.
It is necessary to get involved that the therapy with antibiotic is directed, or, it would be necessary to do microbiological examinations to prevent from producing to him resistance opposite to the medicines, but the hospitals not always fulfill this demand.
The capture of microbiological samples they are even less frequent in case of the ambulant patients or in the basic assistance - Karolina Böröcz affirmed.
It saves itself with the disinfectants
The scientific experiments have demonstrated that in the majority of the cases the MRSA one infects from one patient to other across the sanitary personnel.
Therefore, they redeem a very important role the wash of the hands, the use of rubber gloves and of masks, nevertheless also in this sense considerable absences are experienced in the hospitals.
The MRSA is contagious by means of the transmission for drops and the direct contact between persons, nevertheless in the hospitable national circumstances not always it is possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, the rooms of the hospitals often are packed, the beds often are very together, although to prepare the epidemic, the patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 meters.
Regrettably it is possible to experience also - added Karolina Böröcz - that in the hospitals of the least favorable economic situation saves himself with the disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and that's why there is a major probability for the infection.
In opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where the suitable measurements of prevention are fulfilled, less infections of this type register or it is possible to stop the contagion of the pathogenic agent.
Governmental program against the MRSA
The treatment of the contagion with MRSA is an enormous expense for the National Fund of Insurance of Illness, for what in all the countries one fights against him.
In England for example a governmental program exists to prepare and to reduce the cases of the MRSA.
Apparently the program has successes, according to the given information, the infections with MRSA show tendency of decrease in England.
The European Center for the Prevention and the Control of the Illnesses (ECDC) has between his priorities the prevention of the multiresistant agents (between these the MRSA) and that of the hospitable infections that owe to themselves these pathogenic agents.
Negative the control of alcoholemia of the commander of police officer that caused a mortal accident
The official expert report has done on the case of the mortal accident caused by the commander of the police of the district the XXIInd.
It is possible to exclude the possibility that there was leading intoxicated or in stuned state since then resigned commander of the police of the district the XXIInd, who on Tuesday knocked down and caused the death of a passer-by - there reported on Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the General Prosecutor's Office of the Capital, after the expert report has been prepared on the case.

(The latter fact, that is to say, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Code of Transit they are not attenuating circumstances, the driver has to always transfer the step on having turned.)
The passer-by lost the life after having being hospitalized.
For happened the police leader of the district resigned and requested his retirement, according to the bulletin of the police, because it upset very much the case.
The investigation of the case is in charge of the District attorney's office of Investigation of Budapest.
Attila Morvai said also that ex--commander of the police from a beginning collaborated with the district attorneys entrusted with the investigation.
400 million euros more for infrastructures
The Hungarian minister of finance János Veres and the vice-president of the European Investment Bank (BEI) Marta Gajecka signed on Friday in Budapest three credit agreements - limits for an entire value for 400 million euros to finance infrastructures of education, transport and environment, as well as of the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (BEI) approved in 2006 a budget for 300 million euros to finance in the Hungarian budget to the projects of transport and protection of the environment, which will be realized of the subsidy of the funds of cohesion, of which the parts had already previously signed a credit contract for a value of 100 millions, the contract that they have just signed it refers to the use of the remaining 200 million euros.
The credit contract for 150 million euros is destined equally to finance the budget of the educational projects.
THE BEI approved in whole 300 million euros for this target of Hungary, about the use of the remaining 150 million euros the decision will be taken later, on having extended the credit contract.
The parts signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovations, which the budget will use principally for the project of innovations and investigations of the University of Debrecen.
During the conversations they included also the topic of the construction of the 4th metro line.

According to János Veres, this will be able to take place to earlier in the first trimester of 2008.
From 1990 the BEI financed in whole 113 projects in Hungary at the price of 8,4 billion euros.
The interest of the credits they fit to the EURIBOR and the BEI offers a period of grace of 8 years, without receiving commission for supporting the credit at the disposal of the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
There is admirable the development of the real estate Bulgarian market - the attention of the whole Europe goes towards this Balkan country earlier slightly mentioned.
What thing, where and those who buy on the even more cheap market of the EU, which will get dearer rapidly?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The target preferred for the real estate procurement in East Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with his cheap apartments of the tracks of ski and the chalet of the beaches.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most favorite, while in the beaches Albena, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people look for real estate also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central zone of the country - as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will wake up the interest of the real estate promoters and more and more persons will buy real estate in the zone especially cheap of Rus.
Of equal way the cardinal Sofia will be able to be attractive, the commercial spaces and of offices they promise a rapid recovery of the investment.
Bulgaria is in the best way to turn into one of the most attractive paradise of golf of Europe, being able to be like that a destination emphasized also during others two stations, in addition to the summer and the winter.
Therefore, the cautious investors are already doing his buys, for example in the surroundings of Bansko.
Into opinion of the analysts, which buy real estate in Bulgaria, they struggle to change also his life and his way of living.
The majority of the clients are English, but they come also from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Also the Maltese promoters are present and chipriotas and traditionally there are many Russian clients in the beaches of Mar Negro and in the paradise of ski.
The foreign clients can qualify in three groups - there says Georgi Jankov, the regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who try to settle here buy real estate new or renewed by a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in bad state between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them then.
They demand good communication and access, also for them there has importance the closeness of a big city, the shops and generally of a local doctor.
There constitute the second category the buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included between the first 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
There constitute the third group the real estate investors who do his buys with the hope to benefit in medium or long term.
The price of the of the capital real estate goes in constant growth, since the demand is every time major.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five these years they suffered an annual increase of 21 per cent
The increase of the price of the real estate overcomes considerably the growth of the wages.
Fodor and the six for Hungarian hundreds
As reported the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor the meetings at experts' level will be finished on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official opening will continue the negotiations at the ministers' level on the climatic international diet later to 2012.
The experts and politicians proceeding from 192 countries of the world deliberate on the Waybill of Balí who has on the efforts later to the period of reduction of emission, established in the Protocol of Kyoto, current until 2012.
At present animated discussions are carried out on the individual between the developing countries and the industrialized ones.
The United States has already indicated that for the time being he does not want to negotiate on precise numbers, although it tends to come to the agreement of which compared to the situation of 1990, until the year 2020 it diminishes with 25 to 40 per cent the emission of the responsible gases for the greenhouse effect.
Another big topic of the conference is that if the industrialized countries, in addition to reducing the emission, are or not ready to offer material and technological help to the countries that need it.
One came to an agreement also on the helps to offer to the developing countries.
The fund of support, foreseen in the Protocol of Kyoto, will be directed by a council of direction integrated by 16 members, probably inside the Global Fund for the Environment of the UNO (GEF) - there writes " Piac és Profit ".
The six for hundreds of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the efforts of the EU to preserve his role of avant-garde in the global protection of the climate and to promote the signature of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister declared that the EU is compromised to reduce until 2020, with regard to the level of 1990 in 20 per cent his gas emission, person in charge for the greenhouse effect, independently of if it will be signed or not the " agreement later to 2012 " and is ready to commit itself in diminishing even 30 per cent if other big developed regions of the world and the developing countries also are ready to assume commitments in accordance with his responsibility and his capacities.
Gábor Fodor aimed that the signatory countries of the Protocol of Kyoto of 1997 promised to diminish in 5,2 per cent, inside this 15 Member states of that time of the EU committed themselves in fulfilling 8 per cent of decrease.
The commitment of Hungary is of diminishing with 6 per cent the emission of responsible gases for the greenhouse effect with regard to the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will fulfill - it indicates the press release of the Department of Environment.
It is great what is in game in Balí, since in two years it will be necessary to sign the international agreement of the climatic politics in the long term, because if not, it is sure that his coming into effect would be postponed for after 2012. In this case the commitments of reduction, assumed in the Protocol of Kyoto would not be continued immediately by a new international system of reduction of emission, which need the IPCC was warned in his most recent report, scientific international affiliation of the UNO that deals with the climatic change, which the Nobel Prize of the Peace obtained.
With it, the reduction of the emission would suffer a delay and an increase might not be prevented of any more of 2nd C of the average temperature of the Earth, fact that according to the scientists would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
The British army recruits in YouTube
The units of the British army in a distributor of videos recordings publish on actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize to yes same.
First the British air force (RAD) was the one that made use of the services of YouTube: the special units displaced in Afghanistan from the March, 2006 are loading videos on his actions against the talibanes - the BBC reported.
These recordings done with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in the general body of operations of Kandahar, then London is sent to be loaded on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
139 are already the recordings proceeding from the soldiers of the air force that have been loaded with this form to the Internet and his "channel" it has been already seen by more than 75 thousand persons.
The British Defense Department registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of " defence headquarters " and he publishes videos so much of actions perpetrated in Iraq as in Afghanistan, meanwhile the Department of the Commonwealth of Nations Britons (Commonwealth Office) as the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channel YouTube.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had loaded the videos with targets of recruiting, but in opinion of the Defense Department they serve also to present to the public the real target of the presence of the British army in the exterior.
This type of propaganda practically does not cost anything compared to the television conventional commercials of recruiting - the expert declared the BBC in defender Gordon Mackenzie - on the other hand, inevitably they have some political message, since in a specific form they justify the reason of being of the military actions decided on the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army worries also for the fact that, in addition to the rejealously published and censured recordings, in the distributor keen videos appear also, for example on the death of the soldiers: in the "official" movies of propaganda, little hypocrites, the officials speak as maximum of losses, without presenting nevertheless the bloody part of the combats.
Also, with the fields of battle of Iraq and with Afghanistan the Internet one has been loaded already numerous videos recorded in real operations, but the British alone army lately is making use of this opportunity.
The Americans use an a little different form for the recruiting with free descargables video games of shots named America's Army, in which in the middle of a more or less real situation the player can put oneself directly instead of the soldiers.
Tombola and patty salted in the holiday of Christmas of the departments

On the other hand, the minister of the work Mónika Lamperth does not wait for his companions for an official Christmas holiday, but for a meeting of work of end of year.
One relies on with the participation of hundred eighty guests that - as he should inform the department of press - they will drink only coffee and salty patty, for what the holiday will not cost any more than 350 000 HUF.
The minister for local governments, Gordon Bajnai on the other hand simply will drink with his companions in the classroom of the Department for the Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Department of Finance (MF) will celebrate a Christmas holiday in its own lounge of acts with the participation of 436 workpeople.
The Christmas holiday will have a budget of 2500 HUF as guest - of this budget the reception will be paid with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, the workpeople of the MF every year celebrate of the same form the Christmas.
On the other hand, there will not be festive ambience, the official character will happen not only for the ministerial speech, but also for the schedule of the evening of his celebration.

If the National Assembly disapproves the law of public health, the syndicates will withdraw immediately his call to the strike.
On the other hand, if the law is approved, the commissions of strike will meet and they will decide on the future.
In base of the Monday agenda of the National Assembly also it is possible that only it is voted on the law of public health in the much brought in hours of the night, or perhaps next to the midnight.
As a consequence of the strike that will begin on Monday, it will be necessary to be provided with significant difficulties in the transport: at the railroads one will stop being employed in indefinite time, in the morning it is possible that there to is given birth a part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than the half of the inter-city transport of buses of the companies Volán.
Simultaneously, in numerous points of the country there will be closing of the half of the routes of the highways.
Numerous syndicates and civil organizations have adhered to the strike, his names are updated constantly on the Web page of the League.
Some syndicates announced his strike in indefinite time, others in definite time.
Until the Thursday evening the State Railroad and the Free Syndicate of the Railroad Workpeople (SLTF) could not come to an agreement not so even on the minimal services, although, after the Christmas festivities came closer, every time they are more the persons who travel in the trains.
According to informations received till now, from the beginning of the day until 1 p.m. there will be in strike the workpeople of the Company of Collective Transport of Budapest, those of Budapest Airport from 7 a.m. until 9 o'clock in the morning, will celebrate a strike of four hours the Syndicates of LEAGUE of the Electrical Industry and of Thermal Energy, the Syndicates of the Educators called to a strike of 2 and the Democratic Syndicate of the Educators from 2 until 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors will declare itself in national strike in alternative schedules and the Democratic Syndicate of the Workpeople of the Sector of the Health and Social (SDTSSS) that they are a part of the Forum of Trade union Cooperation, they will celebrate a strike of warning of two hours.
The most important of four demands formulated by the League is that the government withdraws his proposal relative to the reform of the public health and submits a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they introduce gradually the new form of calculation of the pensions that will come into force the year that comes.
The third one is that they assure, even before 2010, for the case of the anticipated pensions the possibility that the occupations that should deserve it could enter the system.
The fourth motive of the strike is that the Free Syndicate of the Railroad Workpeople (SLTF) that is a report of the Syndicates of League, they do not accept the proposal of the Department of Economy and Transport on the side railroad lines and wait for another different proposal.
Cardinal Political: In the country the risk increases for the Hungarian Guard
According to the Division of Analysis of Risks (Risk Analysing Division) of the Cardinal Political the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in August of this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, from several points of view has increased the political risk of Hungary and of the region.
In the " warning on risks " of the company he writes himself: as regards the activity of the Hungarian Guard the biggest political risk constitutes it the fact that " with the worsening of the ethnic existing tensions between the gypsy population and not gypsy of Hungary, even in the short term ethnic violent clashes will be able to take place ".
The principal motive of it is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard probably is the provocation of an event of this one character - there added the representative of the institute of investigations.
They affirmed that all this owes to one of the principal absences of the protagonists of the political Hungarian life: " the protagonists of the social life transferred the public debate of the gypsy problem to the representatives of the political radical and extremist groupings, who could base his political strategy on the existing discrepancies between gypsies and Hungarians ".
This aggravates the problem, disables the normal dialogue, strengthens the extremists and increases the probability of the explosion of the violent conflicts - they estimate.
In addition to that, according to the institute of investigations, the activity of the Guardsman, for consequence of the big attention of the national and international average, " spoilt significantly the image of Hungary in the exterior, especially as for the stability and to the democratic development of the country ".
They remind to us that: from the autumn of 2006 it received every time major publicity and I impel the reorganization of the radical groups and of extreme right hand of Hungary and that from the summer of 2007 there have constituted in the country numerous organizations that define themselves of " affiliations of national self-defense ".
" The common feature of these groupings is that they define themselves as civil organizations, whereas they proclaim openly the training of his members for the defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of the public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, of the army, that is to say of the State " - they add.
They affirmed: all this takes place in accordance with the method that tries to give him a civil presentation to different political aspirations, basing on the dissatisfaction of the society with the politics and with the political parties.
Since to highlight the civil thing and the form of affiliation in case of these affiliations not only serves to avoid the juridical problems of the legal inscription, but it is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor of risk also from the point of view of the relations of neighborhood.
" In the last months, in numerous nearby States they referred to the Hungarian Custody like to a potential danger, whereas the political figures ultranationalists of certain nearby countries, want to justify their own anti-Hungarian politics with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region " - they added.
According to the institute of investigations, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a phenomenon isolated in the Center and East of Europe, so that in the whole region the political risks increased.
They wrote that the Hungarian Custody works in similar form that for example the Bulgarian Guardsman, whose constitution was announced in August, 2007 by the National Bulgarian Union (UNB) of extreme right hand.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard owes to the massive disturbances of the gypsies who took place in one of the quarters of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Making use of this situation, the UNB decided to constitute the custody, with the argument that the target of the organization is " the national self-defense ".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was " gypsy terror " in Bulgaria, nevertheless the State remained impotent and indifferent opposite to the facts - he remembers the Cardinal Political.
They added: this initiative has provoked an animated discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As he wrote himself, indicates the increase of the risk of the clashes ethnic that certain gypsy organizations of Bulgaria have announced that to resist, they will constitute their own custody.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard till now has showed resemblances with that of the Bulgarian Guardsman, it is not possible to exclude that also the gypsies of Hungary react to the threat in similar form, organizing their own self-defense - it can be read in the warning on the risks of the Cardinal Political.
The director of investigations of the Cardinal Political, Attila Juhász to the question of the news agency affirmed: the analysis of risks is one of the activities of the institute of investigations.
As he said, every year they publish his analysis of risks and when they experience something that can influence the change of the risk, they report to the public opinion, since it happened in this case, publishing his warning on the risks.
The holiday not always is written by red numbers
In Hungary the law defines exactly the days that they write each other with red numbers in the calendar and it has already turned into a widespread practice that concerning the holidays - that the year that comes they will be less - the working days reorganize.
Not even in the EU or in North America the holidays are unitary.
The Hungarian laws do a difference between national holiday, holiday of State and festive days.
The festive days fundamentally are related to religious holidays and historical anniversary.
We celebrate the New Year also: so much last day of the old year, like the first New Year's Day is festive - the last one especially so that they could rest those who happened celebrating the old year.
During the whole year we have eleven holidays written with red numbers in the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and October 23, commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20 we celebrate the foundation of the State, on the 1st of May the holiday of the work, on the 1st and 2nd of November we remember our relatives and deceased friends.
Also, in our country holidays of two days are the Easter, the Whitsunday and the Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays seldom coincide with a weekend, that's why frequently bridge does when earlier or after the holiday there is only one working day.
In exchange for the lengthened weekends like that, during every Saturday previous it is not possible to stay away of the work or of the school.
He is the Secretary of Labor who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly previous or later to the holiday.
This legal norm is of obligatory fulfillment for all the employers and for his employees, as well as for the employees and civil servants.
It is not obligatory on the other hand for the companies and institutions of services that, due to his function, work ininterrumpidamente even during the festive days.
This year the order of work will be able to falter only about the holidays of the end of year: from December 24 practically the life stops in the country, since according to the experiences, the majority of the people " does bridge " during the days between the Christmas and the end of the year or they take his vacation during these days.
Next year several of our holidays will coincide with middle or with weekends, for what there will be less changes in the working days that this year.
First the agenda will be modified concerning the holiday of the work so that then, for four successive days, the workpeople could rest.
On Saturday, April 26 it will be a working day, so that in return on Friday, the 2nd of May it is a festive day.
Another change is related to the holiday of October 23: on Saturday, the 18th of October, it will be necessary to work instead of Friday, the 24th.
On the other hand, the year that comes during the holiday of end of year will be able to be rested, since from December 24 one will not be employed at almost any part, not although last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six pequeneces disuasorias to embitter the life of your companions
E-mails that we forget to send, sonorous messages that we never receive, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing: all of them are a part of our Folklore " daily in the work.
It is necessary to decide if you adapt yourself to the small inconveniences or avoid concientemente the confused situations that can irritate others him.
Advices.
$isculpa, one forgot to warn you that they have looked for you of the department of marketing " - one of your companions says ".
What that's why did not you go to an appointment?
Ideally it feels and tries it to repair the matter, perhaps it calls to the department of marketing to say to them that it forgot him to deliver to you the message (this is the least habitual solution).

When you call by phone the office and say that you are sick and the head hurts you unbearably, you sit down badly or, feel that this day you prefer resting; he thinks that others must do your work, your urgent tasks, your work for term.

You lose interest if you want to expire with the expectations of the public
The car advances slowly in the habitual clogging of the morning.
A strange compass sounds in the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I raise the volume.
It changes the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones he joins under and then the voice of a feminine choir as a real jewel intervenes.
The channel mr2 reproduces the song Wings of Love de Zagar.
The musical national life not us malcrió very much with electronic pop of quality.
But now this clogging seems completely different when you are listening to the new disc of Zagar.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs of the digital national underground little by little are changing the image and although again there is of fashion the rock style garage, it breaks guitars, the electro national pop has demonstrated: there are innovations under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer initiated his career in the city of Pécs, touched in the set of Yonderboi until it initiated his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a miscellany of jazz, of electronic dance music and pop, tried to triumph, when they asked him soundtracks cinematographic (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The widest public knew the set that in a beginning was acting as alone in clubes small when the magazine wan2 selected his first disc edited in 2002 between the fifty most important national discs, classifying Zagar, together with Yonderboi as almost the forming national only one of tendencies, capable of selling also on the western markets.
It does not fit doubts that Zagar and his set are of fashion, but nobody has asked them if they go or not with pleasure this label.
The set reacted like it must react: it prepared a new and even better disc.
The newly thrown disc, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead will be able to open new ways for them, although the proper title tries to establish the continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
Since this title was one of the lines of the ancient set of Balázs Zságer.
The reference is well on the airy thing, on the flight, but in addition to the airy of the music, now it appeared - in accordance with the spirit and the tendency of the epoch - the guitar that sounds more loudly, the effect of the rock and roll.
With these songs it presented the disc in Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer who at present works in England with the set The Puzzle.
On the disc there includes a real success of the channel mr2 Petõfi that lately transmits from the morning until the musical popular night. This boradcasting station took up to the ears of the radioyentes the music of high flight of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers ($ivth Underground ").
Since everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: the one that you are interpreting, to what extent is it a music devoted to a select public?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of select public for me means little.
In my opinion two types of castes exist in the light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called alternative underground music like that can be bored, meaninglessly and can be composed equally only for the selling, which it her makes a TV/radio commercial.
But also a good song pop can arise from a sincere inspiration.
Also the attitude of the listeners works with this spirit, independently of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: do you see any difference between the reception of your music on the part of the Hungarian and foreign public?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the Occident of us, the light music has bigger traditions.
There not only the fifteen and twenty-year-old generations frequent the concerts, but also the oldest.
They give very much more attention to the changes that take place in his around in the light music, because they consider it to be a part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: what function does the public have in your work?
Does it import for you who are, wherefrom they are and how much they are the persons who listen to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally I feel good on having seen that every time more people are present at our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for any target, but for any motive.
The role of the public rather feels in the concerts where a reciprocal influence exists, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And nevertheless, I realized that if you want to expire with the expectations of the public, you lose his interest.
hvg.hu: until point you try to follow the lead of Yonderboi?
He works in solitary and it did his career rather to the Occident of us.
B.Zs: We do not continue his way, although sometimes they try to compare our music with that of him.
We rather are employed at team, trust in the musical presence of other and leave that is unrolled.
In a beginning it was inevitable that compare our works with the music of Yonderboi, since many of us we initiate our career in his group and hence we tackled another way.
hvg.hu: In the list of successes of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love it is in the first place.
Many people listened for the first time to the name of Zagar as regards this song.
Did you open concientemente with this style towards a wider layer?
Zs. B.: We were not trying to compose big successes and to sell with these successes our disc.
This song is something more than that.
We add it at the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sonorous bacchanal of the disc and of the heaviest topics.
hvg.hu: how have you selected six singers?
Why exactly to them - which was the principal motive?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a choir to the style gospel.
Wine of that time the idea of creating this choir of the soloists of good voice of our own musical national stage.
This way this choir of six women was created - or Seine, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik õ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - that then was baptized as Prima donnas of Underground.
hvg.hu: did you compose exactly this way the song or the girls changed some things?
Zs. B.: This song existed long ago in instrumental version and when we already had the whole material of the disc, we think that something is still absent.
The chord was attracting the singing.
Still that night I recorded the song that later the girls learned.
Everything came practically to the first attempt and in incredibly spontaneous form.
I remember myself, I was getting enthusiastic very much then, but naturally he needed also the Prima donnas.
With my voice it had not worked with so much force.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and in the disc it seems as if the girls were in flat second.
There are no soloists (except brief alone of Judy Jay), they do not have proper role, sing all together and more strongly than the music, for what the music not only accompanies his singings.
Also in the stage they are located in the fund.
Deliberately?
B.Zs: They are in the fund simply for technical problems.
On the other hand consciously we did not want to distribute soloists' roles.
The song also turns on it, on which we forget a little bit our ego, which the one who of where has come and to where it goes, we leave so that those wings, the wings of the love raise us.
It had wanted to achieve that also others were feeling that one euphoric frame of mind that we feel when this song was born.
hvg.hu: to which did you dedicate more work?
Zs. B.: In the musical composition actually to none, rather at the time of mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example Dorian Gray's Dilemma in whom I am touching in a piano of concert or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where during long moment the groove did not want to work and then, little by little quite put himself to his place like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: what is your song preferred on the new disc?
Zs. B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I have already "released" the disc.
Now Prophet Is A Fool, the Leakage From The Earth and Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks thousands of millions for his complex of inferiority
A disloyal embezzler.
This way it is as it indicates his ancient employee, Jerome Kerviel, the giant French banker of Société Générale, proprietor also of the Bank of Czech Commerce.
For him it lost next to five billion euros.
Nevertheless, it seems rather that Kerviel was a big player who wanted to compare his companions and, undoubtedly, with good capacities.
He knew by intuition some time ago, in contrast to all the big Czech banks, the crisis on the American market of mortgages.
" It has a fragile character " one allowed to be heard of his Superiors, the same ones that they sent to him the police.
But what gets rid of the responses of Kerviel according to what traslucen the French mass media, since the newspaper Le Peels, it is that it was a question of a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1.600 million euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
" Everything what I wanted to do was to gain money for my bank " is assured by him in his responses.
Precisely, in summer, it managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity saw her coming already at the beginning of year.
In February some news was started listening on the so-called mortgages sub-give priority offered to clients of low income or to those that in the past had problems with the payments and of which these clients would start having problems.
Nevertheless, this crisis did not have to influence the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe and bet it correctly.
And later, at the end of the year his profit overcame 1.600 million euros.
" When I already gained my first 500 millions I could not as notify it " Kerviel confesses and he adds, that nothing has been left for him same, by no means.
During the whole examination he declared that he had falsified the records in such a way that it was not going over to his discovery.
It even went so far as to cheat the chiefs, even if the Stock Exchange Eurex started being interested in his business.
The risk turned into benefit
Was he afraid that it was going so far as to discover?
Rather, not.
" I thought that it had gained 1.600 millions for the bank and that from this simple fact, that would make them happy. "
Wherefrom did it extract so many willpower to risk this way?
At my position it had to employed gradually.
It began to be employed at Société Générale in the year 2000, exactly after stopping studying in Lyons.
His annual salary was managing between 51.000 dollars.
Two years later he was already a stockbroker's assistant and in the year 2005 it turned into stockbroker with an annual salary for 90.000 dollars.
Nevertheless it was known that it was never going to win so much as the others.
" In my first interview in the year 2005 I already observed that they were looking at me carefully.
Due to my formation and also my professional and personal progress " it described Kerviel to the investigators.
But to a little time of my entry in the company the first big success came.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz it won, during the attacks with bombs in London, playing the fall a title for 500 million euros.
And this supposed a mechanism of starter, and wanted more.
If it is that you win, we leave you
" This is like a snowball " he said the police.
But it is said that the chiefs knew of all this or that rather they were suspecting it.
" While it was gaining money, they were closing the eyes. "
Only that, later, the blow came at the beginning of this year.
In one day it lost billion euros.
After the weekend to half of January it wanted to erase any trace.
When Monday came to the work, already it was not employed at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5.000 million euros for his fault.
And how did they manage to locate him?
He happened to be a suspect from his vacation.
" I chose only four days for the passed year.
The broker that has no vacation is a broker who does not want that anybody throws a look to his records " it finished Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of obtaining 365 billions
The ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a whole of nine operational programs of which the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns).
It is a question practically of the half of the entire sum that the Czech Republic can obtain of Brussels for the year 2007 to 2013.
Of seven operational programs approximately approximately 125 billion crowns will leave for the regions.
The Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns of the Program Company and Innovation.
Most of the money will be destined to the transport, up to 150 billions.
The Program of Transport is the biggest of the operational programs and it represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain of the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for infrastructures of the transport that next year will be provided with the quantity of 90.800 million crowns.
The program of Company and Innovation must serve the businessmen and companies for the securing of resources in the innovation of the business.
The companies should obtain financing for the acquisition of new technologies, for the industrial investigation and for the implementation of the most effective organizational methods.
As for the current use of the funds of the EU, the Czech Republic is between the newly incomer countries that less use them.
Sorrow of twenty years for the ex-president of Nicaragua, decreed the court
The Court of Appeals of Nicaragua decreed on Thursday the sorrow of 20 years for the ex-president of the country, Arnaldo Alemán, who was condemned in the year 2003 for the embezzlement for 100 billion dollars (almost 1.800 million crowns).
In spite of it, a time later, it was liberated of the jail to go on to house arrest in his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metrópili.
It is not clear at all in these moments, according to the agency AP of which, the Central American head of the state of that time between 1197 and 2002, is again between grills.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will depend rather on the penitentiary agents if they allow German to finish his punishment in house or if they make it return to the prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated like German was penetrating constantly money of the government to the account of a company in Pánama.
This society was fictitious and the account belonged, actually, to his relatives and followers more cercanosT.
Part of this money ended in the fund that German created to finance his campaign in the elections of the year 2001.
This way they approved us the budget
This way it is.
The Budget of State was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first one prepared by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget of this year was already approved by the support of ČSSD, because the minister Sobotka prepared it and ČSSD it was not possible to afford to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the voting on the vote of confidence to the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional sight although the most influential, approved calmly the new law.
It is a big paradox.
Every government starts and ends with every chapter and game of the budget, they liked or not.
The budget is an important part of the politics but in him one hides the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the means of comunicacón and for it they dedicate a special attention.
The political discussions are much more interesting than the simple numbers.
The Budgets of the State of the last governments of the social democrats suffered from three shortcomings that for this year 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first one of them is the high participation of the obligatory laws, called like of expenses of the chiefs who are not only the pensions but also the social services that last year were already approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second one of them is the deficit in the economy as consequence of the first shortcoming.
The third limit is the deficit of the public financing, as the municipal and community budget deficit.
In spite of it, the biggest risk is not in the deficit of the Budget of the State.
This one is public and under control.
The bomb of watchmaker's, nevertheless, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors to be able to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money of the taxes, valuations and credits of the banks, often expressed, meaninglessly, obligations with which they got into debt disproportionately to his town halls.
In the last years they managed to pay these debts by means of the massive selling of energy actions and of other networks of development that they received from the state and from the privatization.
At present they are not provided with this resource.
If we abide only by the official and verified facts, we discover that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, happens for phases of growth of the same form as the rest of the world, about what it boasts ČSSD.
This was the ideal occasion so that his government was clearing up to the finance of the State.
Nevertheless, instead of it the state kept on getting into debt.
The rest of countries, excepting some as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, economized much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a big shame that falls down, especially, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that inside the global measurements we are less threatened by the poverty.
That's why there are not necessary the massive social programs that, unfortunately, in the last years uselessly swelled up with gigantic measurements.
And although they managed to eliminate part of the incomprehensible populist approved expenses this year before the elections, if shortly it does not change the retirement age and the reform of the pensions then will be the end really of any politics in this country and, govern the one who governs only will be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little we can say that the politicians who govern will transform in officials, mechanical distributors of most of the money of the taxes for the retirement and the social services.
That's why, the budget of this year cannot be a revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal expenses of the expenses of the chiefs.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billions for the year 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the past government had not wasted in the last ten years what they could.
We did not want that the politicians who govern turn only into officials for it we must be patients and grant to this weak coalition of the government, which realizes that the state only can spend what is capable of obtaining of the taxes and the valuations, the calmness for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will make possible the gradual achievement of a balanced Budget of the State.

The Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve bank American, the Central Bank of Europe and the Central Banks Briton, Swiss and Canadian decided to fight together against the crisis of the Market of finance.
In the monetary Pronounced one more than hundred billion dollars will be received by means of licitaciónes.
In these tenders the banks auction the types of interest in which are capable of giving money.
For example, the American Fed will send forty billion dollars to bid, and later another twenty-four billions will facilitate the central banks of Europe and Swiss.
After the attacks of September 11, it is the first time that central banks of different states agree in this process coordinated to protect and to diminish the consequences of the crisis of finance.
" This step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is to say, the contínuo growth of the scarcity of free capital that the banks might give " was written by him in his report for the clients, Bernard Baumohl of the consulting company Economic Outlook Group.
" This coordinated action of the central banks probably diminished the recession in the United States from 65 per cent to fifty per cent " Baumohl added in his report.
The banks have already spent sixty billion dollars in unpaid credits, especially in the United States.
The economists wait still for thousands of millions in losses.
" The central banks must have really fear of what waits for them still when they decided to pass " there said the principal economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
" It seems that the situation is really badly " he added.
The central banks are afraid that they have the same problems of access to the loans and that for it they will have to give more expensive his clients.
This would reduce the consumption and would send to the American economy to the recession with different impacts in the growth of the world economóa.
The central banks like that decided, after they were not managing to reduce the so-called tariff LIBOR, interbank London tariff that is used for the loan of money on the interbank market.
This means that the banks were afraid to give themselves constantly money even when the Central Banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain reduced during the autumn his types of interest several times.
" It will take the same effect as another fall of the types of interest " was said by him to the agency Reuters, Greg Salvaggio of the company Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step given by the central banks helps to light the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the USA.
Klaus: The debates of the ecologists are incredible
The global climatic change affects especially to the countries in development.
The president Václav Klaus expressed himself again with regard to the problems of the global warming.
The critique arose now with the closing ceremony of the international conference of the UNO on the climatic change, in Bali.
In Vienna, where it presented his book Azúl, green not planet, he mentioned that the debates of the ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus there is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a representatives' strange miscellany of government and of not governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that is used and the reality.
" There the debates scarcely are structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes of the solution to the current problems " Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book underlined that this topic is for him very important and that that's why he is interested in.
It expressed also his happiness for discovering his book translated into German because as he said " often only I meet the caricature of my ideas ".
Now the interested ones can find out on his mixed opinions.
Klaus remembered that he is not a climatologist but that it has, according to his opinion, sufficient assumptions as to write a book as this one.
It is academic, with aptitude to continue and to judge a specializing oration, it has experiences with statistics and he is also an economist.
In the principal moment of the closing ceremony it expressed his thought which the climate changes constantly and which his changes are normal, that on the warming of the planet does not exist an agreement between the scientists, that the consequences of the current changes neither are so big and serious, they do not even represent possible disasters and that the attempts for influencing the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costosamente unacceptable.
Also as man experienced with the totalitarismos considers to be like unacceptable to impose the opinions not proved to others, which he feels as a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of the others.
To the questions of the presents he told repeatedly that it is not against " of the reasonable defenders of the environment but against the environmental militants who do not take in consideration the relation between costs and benefits ".
About the same topic he spoke Klaus in Vienna already two months ago in the Institute Hayek.

The Top Court of Prague decided as definitive expiration the reduction of the sorrow, the first one to one year, and the second one to two years.

For each of the mothers, three millions, for the parents, two millions, and for the children, a million.
The hospital offers as maximum 200.000 for every father.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál is not at first in accordance with the proposal of Veleba.
" We do not approve such a demand, it is too high " Dostál said after the today meeting.

We will quarrel if it has a value rescisorio.
We are supported in the opinion of which they will be hundreds of thousands for all " it highlighted Dostál.
The quantity should move between the 100.000 and 200.000 crowns for each of the parents.
At the beginnig of the cause, the family of Jablo ň wanted, for every month that they did not raise to his biological daughter, a million crowns.

Polívka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polívka lost the suit on the mark Kingdom of Valaquia.
According to the jueza of the provincial court of Ostrava it was the first one that used the mark Kingdom of Valaquia but the project it was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka does not present himself today at sight orally.
According to his lawyer the cause probably has not ended and his client will resort.
" The suit consists of the fact that mister Harabiš and his team are a few parasites of the popularity of Bolek Polívka " he said after the process, the lawyer of Polívka.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Valaquia, there comes to the whole world the image of the actor and comic.
The same idea has also Harabiš.
" We take after us approximately ten years of work.
Search of money and invention of activities " said.
For him, the cause of the suit is in the money.
" After years I have realized that the project has success and that for it also it might get something.
They want to live as parasites of our work " he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court the mark Kingdom of Valaquia was used first by Polívka in his program of television.
In the year 1993 it was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat ý.
Then it was not a question of facing it towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
Some years later it happened to Harabiš to edit the passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From this comical origin it turned out to be a business and a managerial lucrative activity of the society Reino de Valaquia created which Harabiš later.
In the year 1997, Polívka agreed in the use of his name and signature in the passports and it even offered to his holders discounts to the vistantes of his farm and assistants to his spectacles.
Who will sit down in the throne?
The jueza today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public in the stage for his own managerial benefit.
" It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped to the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia " the jueza said.
He added nevertheless that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team who devoted themselves to it completely.
The collaboration, between today rotten parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From this moment conflicts started happening between Polívka and Harabiš whose culmination came with the overthrow of " king Boleslav I, chosen forever ".
The principal role in the kingdom, for mediation of Harabiš mother derived in singer Jarmila Šuláková, as queen.
In the year 2002, Polívka presented an accusation against Harabiš and his society who up to today has been pushed back by the court.
In skylight it might bring something in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with his princesses, that it is already preparing Harabiš.
Of him the new king should go out.
It has not wanted to reveal yet any more information you nor date.
" We are not in any hurry.
It would have to be something as the way of the king towards Moravia.
The king would have to be chosen in a concrete date.
Even mister Polívka can present oneself " Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: overcome prejudices
To never telling truth, I have liked too much the Peugeotu 206.
His characteristics of march were never special at all, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product might be characterized like below the average.
But now there exists on the market his successor, the Peugeot 207, and this one, it is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and to me, I already only can only think it better.
When I proved the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I was complaining, for example, about the space of the head in the rear seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the bodywork of the Combi means in this sense, that I am not going to suffer before two meters long.
Flying for the world
Step along the interior rapidly not to repeat it too much.
It is a question of an elegant design where the only shortcoming is the poor central tunnel.
Here it would value more the invention of design although the car seems already quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there there stay the times in which we were complaining about short seats and supports.
Also in contrast to the model 206, the side direction has improved considerably.
And the space?, and here it is possible to feel how the measurements of the bodywork have grown.
In the Combi it eliminates the said scarcity of space in the head.
Baggage to the porter
But the principal thing in this vehicle his porter is.
I must value East like very accessibly (thanks to the rear large door abatible) and a well distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with thongs of gum that suppose an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and can spread up to the point of holding heavy objects.
But quedémonos in the deposit.
According to the stage, in basic diet it has a capacity of 428 liters what compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the vehicle of the same type most sold in the Czech Republic, Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with the new generation of the model of Mladá Boleslav, we find out that the Peugeot remains to the rear with his perceptible 52 liters.
Of vacation abroad or on having placed the pram of the child, his value is critical.
But if he had to comment on something positive of that time I must quote the flat that remains quite flat after knocking down the supports of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our tested automobile was equipped by an encedido of injection of four valves on a capacity of 1,6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to telling truth like that, it is as it should seem one 1600 that he will despise the relative five doors.
It is silent, it consumes little and especially, has impulse.
If I compare with the epoch of the škoda of then that seemed as if the tailpipe was stopped up by a rag, I can say that with this one I can be impressed.
The prices answer
The price of the automobile is not for all the pockets.
We have to, nevertheless, bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with ignition of injection of 1400 for 329.900 crowns, still can.
Our aggregations put it from 410.900 crowns, which is already too much.
The guy Premium tested already reaches another 80.000 crowns.
Only that we would have still airbag in the heads, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper, rear automated windows...
That is to say, the car with everything of everything, it costs 531.900 crowns.
It is great, but be provided with the complements of the team in Fabia and it will come to a quite similar number.
Now he stays to decide already only for which of two marks.
The Slovak students do not integrate into the English schools
In the English schools there help children of countries of the Orient of europa and for it, the villagers are afraid of more changes in the schools.
The integration of the Europeans of this one for the time being only brings a series of problems.
Even the British schools register those cases where the conflicts between the emigrants and the children of the native ones increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of the children of europa of this one in the British schools remains very well illustrated in the north city of Kent where the conflicts start growing between the native ones and the Slovak emigrants.
Discussions, estorsión and rows between students have already reached even the proper parents.
The situation has come that far that the police of Chatmam arrested a Slovak woman who was giving sticks to a ten-year-old student with a green pole.
In his defense he said that the girl was insulting his son with insults of racist tone.
The police had to act also after an attack of two minor girls of age against a Slovak emigrant.
The girls entertained him with racist insults and threw to him stones.
" When we were going to house, a boy approached towards us the bus stop and it us started spitting.
When I said to him that it should leave it it did to us the gesture of apples and pears threw ourselves, and later one lowered the trousers and showed us his bottom " it described another disagreeable incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are of both parts.
One of the native ones even designated to the conflict with the emigrants of this one of europa like of struggle for the survival.
The cases already mentioned previously, they show us as the ambience in the English schools it starts being quite tense.
In Great Britain it has inscribed 70.000 Slovaks who came here for labor motives.
Approximately approximately 30.000 Slovak students are present at the English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Carib
For the vistantes it is really the island of the freedom.
Any thing for that he expects from his vacation is possible to go so far as to expire, whenever eliga correctly.
Flat sandy and golden, big waves or a calm sea as a pond.
the palm trees and the all inclusive with bartenders offering pizzas in the beach, frozen or varied coctails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the island of the Caribbean sea all this and much can find more.
Only in an island he finds still and this island is Cuba, the biggest and the most beautiful of all the islands of the Big Antilles.
In the epoch of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called her, the most beautiful place that human eye has seen.
Havana turned into store and port of load of the treasures that the Spanish extracted from America and led to Europe.
And later the American epoch came.
The National Hotel grew at the end of the 20s.
It was ordered to construct one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything what existed of delinquency in the USA (and therefore, prohibited) was welcome and supported on Cuba as drugs, game and prostitution.
Between his guests were, between others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high buildings arose, for wide avenues they were covering the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought to himself an estate in Paula's San Francisco, next to Havana, and in Cojimar it had his yacht.
In the walls of the Bodeguita of the Way there left his signatures the stars of the world of the spectacle and politicians of the whole America.
And today?
In the walls of the Bodeguita habanense you can leave also his autograph.
In the bar of the expensive National Hotel the coctail as his desires mix him.
And these automobiles already of worship of the 50s, up to today they keep on working for Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that they came already some time ago have oxidized between these humid and salty winds.
Even if Havana, especially the ancient quarter is deteriorating notably, it does not exist in the surroundings so many wonderful colonial monuments as there.
Other places transform in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because the tourism brings so much necessary money, his development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years there grew new hotels not only in Havana but also in Dry dock, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islets as Key Coconut, Key Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers still a curiosity that is in the world only and that is much valued by the lovers of the railroad.
The sugar-cane is transported from the immense plantations up to the factories of sugar by narrow routes in electrical steam machines or.
His depots by dozens of years were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and which models brothers who exist in other parts of the world only are in the museums.
To where going?
The place most known for the majority of the vistantes does not change.
And for it, it is not necessary to speak any more of Havana or Dry dock.
Perhaps, only to remember that in the already said estate of Hemingway there is a museum that for those that are lovers of the writer, they must not stop visiting.
The vale of viñales is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows in grounds of lime rock.
Flat-topped hillocks, basins of lime rock and rocks of raised rasped in the falls of the vale, and in his caves there get acclimatized fertile grounds thanks to which it form roquedales that hide dense vegetation.
The vale is the place where the tobacco of major quality is cultivated, probably, in Cuba.
Visiting some of the factories of Havana of cigars he can meet his final product.
Perhaps it seems to someone interesting that there rolled the Chilean part of the series, the Biggest Zeman.
Trinidad
City of old ancestry that much was founded not after the Spanish were colonizing the island.
The slavery and the sugar brought reputation and wealth.
The wealth turned into beauty with the constructions into the small city.
The colonial Spanish architecture especially influenced by the French colonists come later, in four centuries scarcely has changed.
Trinidad, between the sea and the saw of Escambray, is a place so isolated that in the 50s of last century there did not exist yet highway that was joining her with the rest of the country.
Such an isolation her helped to remain out of the rest.
Nothing new was constructed and by it nothing was destroyed, since every person was happy to have where to live, not also.
If there is had more time to be in Trinidad that only one evening, he is worth knowing interesting places in the near surroundings as the Beach of Cove or the vale of the factories of sugar.
the night it belongs to the House of the Music, which cheers the silence of the mornings up with his music.
Baracoa
Small city in the extreme west of Cuba, some of them consider her to be like the most beautiful of the island.
With safety this opinion is already confirmed by the proper way.
Two highways that come there from Guantánamo must happen for high and broken mountains, as well as for a nature that scarcely knows the action of the man.
This oriental place of Cuba has been inscribed as Patrimony of the Humanity by the UNESCO thanks to his intact nature.
There they do the best chocolate, in his church they have the cross of Columbus (actually it is a question of a cross that came 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where one was finding the castle and that now there is a hotel with the same name, the mountains can be seen and between them the most well-known, the Anvil.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Main Saw, the Bay of the Pigs and the island of Pines, the Cabaret Tropicana, the boss of Cuba, the Virgin of the Charity of the Copper, the Santería, African religion that the progeny of those slaves was practising, with all this might fill many pages.
Nevertheless, as it is said, better to see it one day.
The Allied Forces are passive in Afghanistan, say the Americans
Few soldiers and insufficient necessary equipment is what it is influencing in the march of the mission in Afghanistan.
The NATO, according to the American Defense Secretary, Robert gates, should design a concrete plan for the next years.
The misón in Afghanistan is not proving as it was thought, there coincided in Edinburgh (Scotland) the representatives of the countries who have troops in the south part of the country.
At the same time that the conflicts grow with the movimeinto Talibán, today, eight taking part states discuss the plans and coordination of the Allied Forces.
Whereas the United States this week by means of his Defense Secretary, Robert gates, cheered up to the forces of the NATO to a major activity, Great Britain vé as priority to reinforce the authority of the Afghan government and the share-out of the help to the development.
" The development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can be only one of the solutions.
The following one is to make possible to the population that alone they could begin the economic development and of safety " the Defense Secretary said to the boradcasting station BBC, Des Browne.
Ninety per cent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to information of the American army is major than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew compared to the last year in 27 per cent, and in the province Helmand up to 60 per cent.
The countries of the NATO have in Afghanistan about 40.000 soldiers of those who the fourth part are in the south of the territory.
Nevertheless, for the United States, the Allied Forces have come to the same limit as for organization and equipment of the units.
Exactly they ask for more helicopters, soldiers and experts pra to train the Afghan units.
" We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and the way in which we will reach them " Gates said.
In a similar sense also there spoke today the General Secretary of the NATO, Jaap de Hoop.
" It does not make me happy to know that it is what we have in the ground and the sky in Afghanistan.
We have ninety per cent of soldiers and teams that we would need, and that is small " he said Of Hoop to the agency Reuters in the closing ceremony of the meeting of three days with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
The one who is passive
Between the countries assistants in the last months the polemic reigns of if all the Allied Forces do the maximum in Afghanistan.
By debit Germany was criticized, for example.
" The Germans have in Afghanistan a relative number of substitutions.
But they are in a zone of minimal violence and the requirements of struggle there are not so high as in ours, in the south part and this one of the country " Gates said.
The periodic sensationalist Sun, this week called the German soldiers vagrants.
" The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans devote themselves to play whereas our boys fight " Sun wrote in a material accompanied on photography of German soldiers playing to the tennis of table.
The German Bild answered to the attack and published a photography where the British troop was playing to a party of rugby in the south part of Afghanistan.

For every Czech, the debt corresponds to 84.000 crowns.
For the whole last year the State got into debt with more than 111 million crowns.

Next year the debt should move between 900.000 millions and the trillion of crowns " said for the servant iHNed.cz, the economist of Homeland Finance, David Marek.
Of similar form it is seen also by the economist of Next Finance, Vladimír Pikora: " We might spend the trillion during the year 2009.
Exactament when that will depend on the next budget that we do not know yet.
If it was seen that the situation in the political scene was changing and the politicians would be capable of saving, then it might be late a year 2010.
But I do not see such a change " he added.
The doubt grows
The government stock believes debts in the central government and it arises, especially, from the accumulation of the deficit of the budget of the state.
The government stock is paid by means of bonds of the treasure, obligations of the state, direct credits or for example loans of the European bank of Investment.

It is interesting that the growth is generated especially of the obligations where there is a growth of 20 per cent.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows with that he goes away to negotiate until beech " Pikora commented on a reform of the pensions.
Better than is waited

The quantity is composed, especially, of the deficit of the budget of the state that this year will be 76 million crowns in vey of due 91.300 million crowns.

The history goes back in fact to September, when this teacher asks his pupils, of 6/7 years of age, to choose a name for the bear of plush of the class.
" Eight names go out of the mouth of the children, as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed ", tells the director of the school Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in class, 20 children of every 23 there is elegigo to Mohamed as favorite name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Moslem prophet, but especially a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have realized a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following legend " My name is Mohamed ".
The bear he - same was not taking any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered as an insult to the Islam.
One of the Moslem companions of Gillian Gibbons, teacher in the same school in Sudan, added that he knew her well and that it would never have done anything that could be insulting towards a religious faith, " I feel it only that has asked the children to vote for a name ", it is a question according to him only of a " innocent error ".

But which are the rules that concern the use of this name?
Can we give it for example to a toy?
It is a question of course of a question of interpretation.

The election of the statu quo
No surprise on Sunday, to the exit of the urns: the Russian is going to choose massively for the party of the president Poutine, close Russia.
Confirming his aspiration to the stability, even to the authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
To three days of the legislative elections, the Russian president Vladimir Putin directs for them today to the electorate a message televised on the public chains, already registered but whose content secret is kept.
It does it as leader of the list for the close Russia, the party pro-Kremlin whose victory is revealed crushing.
Yesterday, the president did not leave anything transparentarse receiving the foreign ambassadors, being satisfied with delivering a piece of news it loads against the Occident accused of interference - his topic of predilection during the campaign.
" We know the price of a real democracy and wish honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incidents ", he added.
According to the opposition, we are much far from the truth.
It denounces a campaign stained by pressures.
The communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there is not " never had so dirty elections, even in the epoch of Eltsin ".
After the repression of the declarations of last weekend, to the ex-champion of the world of check Garry Kasparov, condemned to five days of prison for illegal declaration, the visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
" The Russian kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus "
Behind these legislative elections without surprise two much more open questions are outlined:
Who will happen to Poutine to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first return of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make to know.
Chosen in 2000 and chosen again in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot request the third consecutive order.
Then no successor emerges.
Which role will Poutine play after March?
Prime minister?
Chief of the parliamentary majority and of the very powerful party close Russia that elegería the government and the president?
Be what is, to the legislative elections like to the presidential ones, the projecting power will triumph.
It is a tradition.
" The Russian kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, proprietors of his destination do not feel ", there estimates the sociologist Lev Goudkov, the director of the independent center Set sail.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov, of the state university of Saint Petersburg, goes back further: the civil society was slow in this country cristianizado five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of the individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s, " Poutine restored the model of a paternalistic State, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been continued by the terrorism, but by a certain economic relief ", Maria Lipman estimates, of Foundation Carnegie.
Today the Russian " resigns for proper will from the personal responsibility " of whom briefly they had given test after the explosion of the USSR.
" Why to reflect? "
The phenomenon touches all the social layers, included the world of the matters.
And the administrative elite thinks to preserve the statu quo: 65 governors (of every 85 chiefs of Russian regions) direct the local lists of the close Russia..
The new freedoms imported from the Occident are often synonymous of chaos, as in the 90s.
The opinion prefers the stability.
On behalf of that the Russian will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, teacher of age of 54 years: " why to reflect?
Are not those who are to the power too bad, why to change them? "

Will there be rally of end of year in bag? The experts divided by the crisis 'suboccupy first place'
At least of five weeks to dismiss the closing of the exercise, the investors already rub the hands hoping that there should come the traditional rally of end of year.
Nevertheless, this year the experts do not realize well that this one goes away to produce.
Banif believes that " from the statistical point of view, in December in bag it usually has a positive behavior.
Nevertheless, it is not convenient to realize forecasts being even more based exclusively on the statistics, because in the current context, the suspense watches on the markets, at least in the short term ".
Although they are not partial of that the lame bag run in the last weeks of the year, these experts aim that " the stock market is supported by the existence of liquidity, ready to invest given the absence of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed revenue affected by the effect flight was doing quality values both in the long stretches and in the short ones ".
For it, they believe that the bag will have a rather side behavior, I do not exempt of volatile nature " especially by that there is not known the impact of the probable descent of the types of the Fed, considering the high level of the crude oil and the danger of stimulus of the inflationary tensions ".
Javier Barrio, person in charge for selling of BPI in Spain, coincides with that is not a good moment to risk to say that it is going to be rally.
" The thing is not for many happy moments ", makes sure the expert.
The Ibex has lost next to 4 % from the maxima marked on November 8 when the index closed in 15.945,7 points.
Nevertheless not all the experts have this so negative vision.
Juan Solana, analyst of Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 might close the year closer to 16.000 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pension plans that produce to themselves every year in these dates.
Nevertheless, the expert tints that the things will be slightly different this year since he believes that the rally will go forward to the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not think that the volatile nature is going to affect to the tendency of the market.
For his{your} part, Federico Olucha, analyst of Inversis Banco, values that we are next to technical levels and " therefore we might see a rebound of the index that might turn impelled depending on the news that come from the USA as for the consequences of the crisis on the credit market ".
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
The analysts are in accordance with the hour of choosing the values that will be the managers to lead to the Ibex towards new maximum levels.
Sun porch, of Intermoney, affirms that " this year touches him to the big values ".
The expert would include in the portfolio two big banks and some constructors " because when the date comes, the electrical sector will be very expensive ".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco makes sure that the increases will come from the hand of the banking and from the industrial sector.
The constructors also will be able to benefit from this rally, in case of happening.
" ACS goes several months recovering positions and we hope that other constructors as Railroad and FCC should continue the same way ", tells the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be a protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase of the selling in the period of Christmas selling.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technological ones also will do it very well although in this case there is no great representation on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven year
In the last seven years, in only two occasions December has been a downward month.
The authentic rally of end of year was lived in 2003, exercise in which the stock markets went out of the crisis provoked by the prick of the technological bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28,17 %, in December registered an upturn of 6,68 %.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profit (for the time being the Ibex raises 8,36 % from January) and if it manages to be provided with his rally of end of year.

For it, the entity will modernize the divisions that it already has in commercial zones, adapting them to the profile that there present the clients of the different streets.
Thus the enlargement of the schedules accompanies itself of a conception different from the space of the division and a new design, more current, with more luminous colors.
The person in charge of commercial banking, Ángel Rivera, makes sure that this restructuring does not suppose a big investment, although if a major hiring of personnel, since it passes of taking approximately six employees as a place to eight or nine.

Telecinco doubles for the first time the value in Stock Exchange of his rival Antena 3
It is conseguidó.
With this phrase there was expressing yesterday his satisfaction Paolo Vasile, representative adviser of Telecinco, at the end of the market, when he was stating that the chain that it directs was duplicating the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only an aspect was steaming up his happiness: ' it is what hurts me, it is not because we have grown more but because we have gone down less ', he was affirming.
Nevertheless, it emphasized that on a weak market, ' we have fallen down less '.
Telecinco finished yesterday the day with an advance of 2,54 %.
This profit places his loss in what we go of year in 15,66 %.
The value in Stock Exchange of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52 % of the capital) and informed by Vocento (other 13 %) reaches this way 4.488,88 million euros, according to information of Bloomberg.
His rival Antena 3, which yesterday transferred a 1,52 % and it accumulates a descent of 40,5 % from January, costs the half, 2.193,46 millions.
The value of other quoted companies of communication amounts to 3.571 millions in case of Sogecable; 2.518,53 million Hurry (publisher of Five Days) and 1.779 millions Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is due to the fact that ' we are speaking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are capable of doing, on the same market, to what cost and how we promote it in terms of hearing '.
Telecinco announced last week that it foresees to turn this year into the first chain of television in overcoming 1.000 million advertising gross income, as made sure Giuseppe Tringali, the representative adviser of Telecinco and of Publiespaña, the branch that manages the publicity of the group.
Of making to him this announced fact real, the chain of television would register this exercise an increase of 3,6 % in his invoicing of publicity with regard to 965,4 millions of the exercise 2006.
For his{your} part, the clear invoicing of Antenna 3 increased a 1,6 % in the first nine months of the exercise (up to reaching 734,4 millions) whereas the clear income of the television grew 0,7 % (630,4 millions).
One of the factors at that the analysts aim for the best relative evolution in Stock Exchange of Telecinco is the high pay out that it has supported till now: in 2006, the company presided by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100 % of the benefit between his shareholders.
Vasile makes sure that, although it is prompt to take the decision, this ratio might change after the buy of 33 % of Endemol in affiliation with his counterfoil Mediaset.
' We take the official commitment to give as a minimum 50 %, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope that we should be capable of leaving contentments to our shareholders, whom we have already given value with 33 % of Endemol '.
According to the analysts, the market gives samples in these moments of certain weariness.
Lehman Brothers reduced recently his estimations of benefit on Telecinco in 2008 4 % and in 2009, 7 %.
It owes, they tell, to that it has cut away the due growth of income of 10,5 % to 8,4 % in 2008 and from 5,5 % to 5,1 % in 2009.
The same signature has lowered the forecast of profit of Antenna 3 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: he recommends to buy both values being based especially on his high profitability by dividend and sustainable potential in the long term.
2.
Box Madrid: it sees Telecinco better to (accumulate) that to Antenna 3 to (support) for the ' multiple attractions ' and rise of the business.
3.
JPMorgan: it recommends infraponderar in both cases on having had ' similar threats ' (saturated market and worse economic climate).

Bond accepts to head the candidacy of the Spanish socialist party for Toledo and to preside at the Congress if they win
The ex-Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offering of the prime minister and General Secretary of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the Spanish socialist party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be a president of the Congress in case the Socialists gain the general elections.
This way it has been announced in press conference by the secretary of Organization of the Spanish socialist party, José Blanco, and the proper Bond, after the meeting that has supported this midday in the federal head office of this party with Shoemaker.
The chief of the Executive has justified the offer to the ex-minister because " it is important to be provided with the best " in the political life and Bond " it is between the best ".
Also, it has aimed that " yes seems " that the of La Mancha politician will be the candidate of the socialistic group to preside at the Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bond would replace as president of the Congress Manuel Marín, who made public last November 15 his decision not to present itself to the next general elections and to leave his career in the active politics to devote itself to fight against the climatic change in the university ambience.
The ex-minister has admitted that the prime minister has not stopped insisting so that it should return to the political avant-garde since it was leaving her two years ago.
Also, it has pointed out that, as the citizens know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish socialist party gains the elections, his party has wanted to be announced who will preside at the Congress, in a " act of transparence ".
If it reaches the charge, Bond hopes to turn the Chamber into " the house of the respect and not of the insult or of the scream ". and to do that " it looks alike increasingly to the citizens ".
" Sometimes regrettably it seems that the local only one of Madrid where it is not possible to speak calmly and with calm it is the Congress, in certain occasion 26 times interrupted the prime minister in the Senate ".
Also, it has had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and " his good one do " and have not wanted turns already filling his vacancy not to fall down in what, as it has indicated, his adversaries might see as " dominance ".
Climatic propaganda
Since the movement against the climatic change submits to inmisericorde pursuit so much to the skeptics of his prophecies as to those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is forced to show a coherence of iron.
And more a leader of the movement who is a prime minister as Shoemaker and believes that this struggle is more important than that of the Islamist terrorism and he even proposes to sign a " new contract with the planet ".
This exposition forces him to explain why the action, or the inaction, of his Government they have contributed decisively that Spain heads the EU in nonperformance of Kioto.
Who are the persons in charge of the nonperformance, in what sectors it has taken place and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
Also, it demands him that to explain with the maximum clarity to the what Spanish is the measures that it is going to take to brake the climatic change.
What companies will see affected, what civil habits they will have to be changed, what energy individual and collective savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences it will have.
Or, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there neither has been there nor will be these explanations.
Precisely because it is a question of sacrificing and of paying.
The measurements against the climatic change, the real measurements, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and individuals.
Up to the cent of the gasoline suggested by the Spanish socialist party it has seemed so dangerous electorally to Shoemaker who has hurried to deny it.
Or, that is a question of saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With phrases impactantes, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, this so useful gentleman for the electoral campaigns either that or speech or denunciation does not even demand, but it adorns the mítines and inspires tenderness.
Whenever it limits itself to being a merely virtual contracting party and does not claim that we move in bicycle or freshen up with the fan.

My family doctor gives one of his articles me of rare investigations titled: ' The money produces cerebral activations, especially if the others receive less '.
Or, that the feelings that the monthly pay of the workpeople generates it depends on what the partners gain.
The study has been realized by means of magnetic resonances tomográficas in the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the last number of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and the director of the group of Image of Neurocognición of the Institute Life*Brain, in Germany: " The strongest activation was taking place when the participant was answering correctly and his partner was failing ".
The investigators observed that if when both were right they were receiving the same pay, the activation was moderated, but if one was receiving the double, the activation was major.

What insurance is convenient for me?
The insurance of automobile, which covers the driver before possible catastrophes, supposes an important expense that will depend on diverse factors such as the age, the sex, the antiquity of the card, the marital status, the type of vehicle to assure or the use of to this one, between others.
To have the car is only the beginning.
And the fact is that, to choose the insurance of suitable automobile it is even more difficult that the model of vehicle to choose.
First of all it is necessary to realize well about what we are speaking.
The insurance of car is an agreement between an insurance company and the policyholder.
This commitment materializes in a contract of insurances, which establishes that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for the fact that he becomes a person in charge for the obligation of paying the indemnifications in case of catastrophe.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established bearing in mind diverse factors such as the age, the sex, the antiquity of the card, the marital status, the type of vehicle to assure or the use that him of to this one, between others.
The insurance companies establish his prices according to the statistics, so that to major probability of suffering an accident, major quota to pay.
It is for this reason for which both the biggest of 25 and the women have to pay lower premiums, since the statistics reflect that they have a minor index of siniestralidad due to his prudence.
Also, throwing hand of the inventories, the companies have come to the conclusion that the married persons tend to have less accidents than the single drivers.
The use that him of to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and with it in the probability of having some type of mishap.
On having increased the frequency, they increase the probabilities.
There are great the variables that the insurers bear in mind at the time of establishing the price of the premium.
It is for it, that the driver has to study well the situation to choose that insurance of automobile that better fits to his profile.
We will exhibit here the most significant variables at the time of choosing one or another type of insurance, so that this one, in addition to adapting itself to the characteristics of the policyholder, offers him a reasonable price.
The young people younger than 25 years meets diverse disadvantages at the time of hiring an insurance at an obtainable price, since they are the limited experience in conduction and the antiquity of the card.
Although the ideal thing to be insured well an insurance is to any risk, other more economic options exist.
The most cautious drivers can choose for any risk with exemption, so that they obtain the coverages of an insurance to any risk but at a more feasible price.
This class of agreement would suppose that the client pays a part of the amount of the catastrophe.
" The part of the amount of the catastrophe that the client contributes will be preestablished according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower is the amount ", there specifies Luis Noguera, maximum person in charge in Spain of First Europe, mediator of insurances online.
Another option is an insurance to third extended, so that the client assures to himself the protection before damages provoked to third, although not before the caused ones in your own car.
Also, it would be covered by theft, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
An advice.
If you are a 25-year-old minor try to be careful and to avoid the catastrophes as far as possible, since this will reverberate in the bonus, being able to reduce the cost of the insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the tariff base that the company possesses.
On the contrary, a penalization is an extra charge on the above mentioned tariff base.
" The bonuses and penalizations will depend on the company and on the benefit of this one.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses ", he clarifies Walnut tree.
Spent the stripe of 25 years the drivers have it easier at the time of hiring an insurance, since the index of siniestralidad diminishes thanks to the piled up experience.
For this reason, the most advisable thing is to hire any risk with exemption.
" Normally the young people cannot make use of the experience previously acquired at the time of using in an accident, and even at the time of the conduction ", makes sure the director in Spain of the European company, to what he adds that the majority of the accidents take place in the second year of conduction, once spent already the ' fear of the beginner '.
Nevertheless, if the client is married but it has no children yet it is preferable that I negotiated an insurance to any risk, any time his economic situation allows it to him, skylight is.
For his{your} part, the marriages with children are considered to be by the insurers the public with minor index of siniestralidad, for what the extra charges will be minor.
In this case the best insurance would be one to any risk with exemption (being able to be this one of 300 euros), or, when he gets ready of a high level of bonus, one to third extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
" They carry out a more relaxed conduction and have a major purchasing power to allow him the luxury of assuming a quantity of major exemption ", pronounces himself Luis Noguera.
For the pensioners an insurance is advisable to any risk with exemption (being this one of 150 euros), or one to third extended when a high level of bonus is had.
It is necessary to say that the insurance of automobile is something important, not only because it covers to the driver before possible catastrophes, but also because it represents an important expense, reason for which it is fundamental to study appropriately the insurance that more is convenient for us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic looks in Milan for a point that costs the eighth ones
Milan and Celtic measure themselves this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point that they lack to achieve his respective targets in the closing of the liguilla of the 'Champions', since it serves the Italians to be the first and to the Scots to sentence his classification.
The Italians add ten points and they already certified in the fifth day his pass with a tie in Portugal, whereas the Celtic has nine points, but he still needs other to insure itself that the Shakhtar, with six, and that receives the Benfica, which has four, do not move forward him.
These two parties of the Group D will be played one week before it finishes the whole sixth day, since the Milan has to dispute the World cup of Clubes in Japan, where it makes debut on the 13th in semiends in search of a square by the final of 16.
This way, this group will remain closed before the rest and the tie in Giuseppe Meazza looks like the most awaited result, although two teams will try to go out for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate on house and the Celtic knows that winning it would remain first and a better crossing would insure itself in eighth.
To the set of Gordon Strachan it might serve him even a defeat to qualify if the Shakhtar does not win, but he will not be able to entrust oneself because to equality of nine points the pass is for the Ukrainian ones, that they lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but gained (2-0) in another direct duel.
This way, the milanistas will try to embitter him the night the Scots, who are confident of getting in eighth for the second time into restructured Champions League and of consecutive form, after they were defeated precisely in this round the past campaign with a goal of Kaka in the extension (1-0) after 0-0 of the going.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' the Shakhtar will be to the one that only costs him the victory, in case it loses the Celtic, so much to get in eighth as to continue in the UEFA.
And it is that the Benfica, in spite of being last and without options to continue in the maximum European competition, might reach the third square with a victory, with what it would play the UEFA.

New fears on the gas between Russia and Ukraine
The increasing dispute for the price of the gas between Ukraine and Russia, increases the risk that it affects the exportation of the fuel to Western Europe on the part of Russia.
The majority of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed across Ukraine, for what every rubbing between both nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of the gas, Russia will have to pay valuations of transit more discharges.
A previous dispute last year limited the provisions to the states of the EU.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, monopolistic proprietor of the gas, Gazprom, trying to agree the quantity of money that had to pay Ukraine for the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom declared that he will charge more to Ukraine, since this one has promised to pay 50 extra % in 2008 for the gas that Turkmenistan comes from the neighbor.
The analysts say that it might be that Ukraine pays more 40 % for the imports of Gazprom.
" It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important tránsitos for the gas during the conversations " the Ukrainian Secretary of the Treasury Anatoly Kinakh said to the news agency Reuters.
" The changes in the prices of the gas should not relate to our arguments on the levels of the valuations of transit [towards europa western] route Ukraine ".
The last big dispute for the gas between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut the supplying to Ukraine in January, 2006.
This meant a fall in the exports to europa western, which raised rapidly the prices.
The Russian gas represents the fourth part of the supply of the EU.
Russia has the biggest reservations of gas of the world, but good part of her is still not completely developed.
As result, Gazprom complements his own supply with gas of Turkmenistan and other Soviet ex-nations of Central Asia.
NHS " will have to prove the foreign workpeople "
The Scotch NHS needs to control the records of criminal records of the employees of out of Europe, said the vigilant one.
The recommendation of the auditor general Robert Black came after it was proved that a foreign doctor was related to the attack to the airport of Glasgow, in June.
Black also showed his worry of which the Scotch NHS does not have exact idea of the quantity of foreign personnel with which it is provided.
Nevertheless, his report indicated other control panel that are carried out correctly across a sample of five authorities of health.
The general auditor checked the quantity of foreign personnel hired out of the economic European area, immediately after the attacks to the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor of the Hospital Royal Alexandra of Paisley, was arrested in the airport after shocking a jeep in the doors of the terminal building of the airport.
It was one of three doctors who operated in Old Bailey for video conference in October, accused in relation to the supposed offences with car bomb in United Kingdom.
NHS hopes to carry out the checkups of pre employment to the candidates, to make sure to him that they expire with the qualifications, the experience and the authorization to work in United Kingdom.
Although the meeting of health of Scotland uses " Disclosure Scotland " to carry out the control panel of criminal records, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information out of Great Britain.
The report of the general auditor recommends, between other measurements, which the meetings should be provided with the handlebar of the Criminal Records Bureau, who helps the employers with the penal control panel in many countries out of Great Britain.
" Although we find any of the personal records with evidences of this control panel, this is not a routine review ", he says the report.
Black declares that the Scotch NHS has a high level of fulfillment of his own employment policies, but it indicates that: " our report emphasizes the areas that can be improved to guarantee that he gets ready of the necessary information in the number of foreign personnel of the NHS. "
The president of the BMA Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said that it was " very little probable " that the checkups of pre-employment could identify to used potentials of NHS that could commit terrorist acts in the future.
" The report suggests that the checkups of pre-employment work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what is the added value of the made recommendations ", he told.
The Scotch authorities of health declare that at present they are provided with 1.161 foreign persons, the majority of them doctors and nurses
But the general auditor warned that the number can be higher, partly because the meetings have problems in identifying what are the employees who are provided with indefinite authorizations of residence.
The investigation also thought that the procedures of cross-check established by the authorities of NHS in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were fulfilled widely.
This includes the control panel of passport, work permit and checkup of qualifications.
The Scotch government is checking at present the politics and guides of pre-employment of the foreigners in the NHS.
The secretary of health, Nicola Sturgeon, declares: " It had a big interest that was carrying out this work immediately after the terrorist attack of the airport of Glasgow.
He added that the Scotch government, as a whole with the meetings of health, might consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will reflect in the update of the guides of control of pre-employment for all the groups of work - including the foreigners - what they were reckoning to publish next month.

Climate of Venus can give an idea of the future of the Earth
Venus could have been once a place adapted for the life, scientists declared yesterday.
The information of an European spaceship in orbit showed to the planet most similar to a twin of the Earth of what had been observed previously.
Venus is the planet nearest to the Earth.
Two planets have similar size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is lightly closer to the sun.
Million years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar those who did of the Earth an inhabitable planet, believe now the scientists.
But the effects of the dioxide of carbon and the greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion for the solar radiations and the slowest solar rotation sent Venus to a guy of very different development.
Today the planet has no water, the temperature of the surface is sufficient to melt lead and it is eroded by the hurricane-force winds and thunderstorms of beams.
The results of the Spatial European Agency for the Venus Express, which has studied the planet for one year, it offers a panorama of how the Earth might develop catastrophic changes because of the climate.
The teacher Fred Taylor, of the Department of Physics of the Oxford University and one of the leaders of the mission Venus Express, declares: " One is clarifying porqué the climate in Venus it is so different from that of the Earth, when they are two so similar planets.
" Our new information makes possible to construct a stage in which Venus began as the Earth, possibly with an inhabitable environment million years ago. "
Police officer seizes " enriched uranium "
One kilo of radioactive material, which they declare is an enriched uranium, it was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A portavos of the police declared that three persons were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash might not confirm if it was an enriched uranium but he said that it might have been sold by 1 million dollars (480.000 pounds sterling).
It still remains opened
Mitt Romney says that it is not worthy that the presidential candidates answer the questions of a monkey of snow.
Nevertheless, the republican candidates for the presidency possibly agree to support a debate in YouTube, in which common and current voters record questions in video and the candidates send them for his diffusion between.
None of the questions presented in the evening of Wednesday, the 28th of November were more ridiculous than that of the monkey of snow that he asked the democrats about the climatic warming in the debate of the republican party of YouTube.
But the questions, and the responses, this time reflected much of the state of the republican party facing the elections of next year.
There is not known exactly how the producers of the CNN, who co-sponsor the debate, chose the videos of YouTube to show to the candidates for applicants.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest dedicated to only one topic, focused in the immigration.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for the Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to raise the dial when they were listening to ideas that they were liking: the issuers noticed peaks of approval when the candidates were speaking with extremist arguments.
The exchanges of words more five-peseta coins of the night happened between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, which has been a leader in the crucial polls of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin the reputation of Romney since it was soft with the illegal immigration when he was a mayor of New York.
It attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the ex-governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to be employed at his house.
Both answered aggressively when they asked them if some candidate might support a "amnesty" (allowing the illegal ones to regularize his situation and giving them the possibility of obtaining the citizenship).
The minor candidates as Duncan Hunter, a Californian conferee, and Tom Tancredo, a conferee of Colorado, achieved agreement with the topic.
None has the word of candidate is nominated, but both remain in the career perhaps because both were alert on the topic of the immigration before others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, the candidates share points of view: increase of the alertness on the borders, intolerance with the illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of the poisonous toys of China and other worries on the outside, helps the republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between the liberal ones and the Christian conservatives.
But the debate transformed in uncomfortable when other topics appeared.
To Mr. Guiliani asked him why it had supported the control of weapon in the past.
John McCain y Mr. Romney debated about if the immersion in water must be considered to be a torture.
A person asked if the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This took Mr. Giuliani to stumble towards the position of which to although the Bible was his favorite book, the creía literally in the history of the Jonás and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesús would support the capital punishment.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all the expectations, first of all in the most recent poll of Iowa, thanks to his Christian conservatism of long byline - said that the capital punishment was painful but necessary.
When it was pressed to answering if Jesús would be in favor, the rió saying that Jesús was too intelligent as to be a candidate in the elections.
The career is still unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee increases in Iowa, coincidentally with the campaigns of collection of funds of liberal Ron Paul, and his heated declarations of the Wednesday debate.
They two have gone out from the fund, because two wings of the party did not come to agreement on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined to the party early and convincentemente with a winning message on the nobility of America, satisfying to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from being a skylight.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but equally it emerges
As the political scandals continue in England, this one is not particularly interesting.
Influences do not seem to have sold, one nor treats of exhorbitantes accounts of hotels either in Paris, or licks of extramarital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a rich businessman has disguised contributions to the party of Labour English government, of more than 650.000 pounds sterling (1,3 million dollars), for next to four years using false names, and that the party did not denounce it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided to call to an election, insulting stupidly the British intelligence declaring that the opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead of that, as Vince Calbe, the liberal democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because been afraid Mr. Brown has happened of being Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in problems, demonstrated the regulative weakness and the poverty of judgment in moments of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the code of taxes it has put the managerial, together groups, against the government.
The fiscal authority lost 25 million personal information that revealed an administrative unimaginable botched job.
A trio of retired generals they initiated a riot in the camera of the Lores, protesting against the courts in the defence spending: to be the ministers of the armed forces is, they were protesting, an employment of half a time.
Now they are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour General Secretary (and previous accomplice) has already resigned.
Nothing of this means that Mr. Brown walks irrevocably towards the exit.
The governments can come to a point of inflection later that are unable to govern.
The people do not believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend his incredulity when a new lot assumes the control.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve the things, that does not reduce a lot of time, this suspension is of more: the civil servants begin to fail; the ministers of office are exhibited; the press looks for bad news; and the government puts itself on the defensive one and does not focus.
In a part, the position of Brown is particularly difficult, because in contrast to other political leaders it cannot defend oneself arguing that is new.
Although he wanted to renounce Tony Blair, he was his top lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the tax of record of authority, they are related to the decisions that Brown did as chancellor of the treasury.
And even if it is not directly wrapped in the mishaps of Blairish - or " cash for associates ", the investigation of the financing of the political parties - the voters can take up office that if it it is.
Nevertheless, the situation of Mr. Brown is not so bad as it seems.
The gaffes are not so bad as the Tories want to show.
Like in Mr. Bean, nobody has died, nor has been defrauded directly.
And the remedy, although painful, it is to give what the tendencies naturally Stalinistas of Mr. Brown they have always promised: a trustworthy and brutal government.
The new political scandal of the donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with gifts of charity, says that he does not wish public recognition for his benevolence.
This perhaps is like that, but the decision does not take it he.
The laws against the anonymity for the big political taxpayers it is clear and it exists for a clear reason: the public has right to know who is buying access to that they have the power.
Mr. Watt, who said to know in the agreement of Mr. Abraham, and that this was not illegal, obviously will face Jon Mendlesohn, chief of collection of funds whom he wondered on the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown till now is not implied: there is nothing that he suggests that he knew of these performances, although the thickness of the payments was done after he was taking control of the office in June.
Up to the moment the prime minister has done the half of the work.
It has been rapid in condemning to his party for violating the law, but it is diluted in the capture of decisions by a familiar matter, a commission of investigation on the matter - led, in good measurement, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter of the police.
Also, there are other things than Mr. Brown must do, like find a permanent and independent chief for the Commission of Norms in the Social life, since it has not had one for six months, and also it must press for a genuine reform of the financing of the parties.
This will need an arduous cooperative work of the Labours Parties members with the Tories, and perhaps a resignation to the financial special situation that is had by the syndicates - bitter measurements for the partisan one as Mr. Brown.
But he must face to some partisan facts.
The conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he is two years old to win voters; and the only way that it can move to the victory is in acting with an impeccable righteousness and a solid competition.
Sharks cards
The crisis of the mortgages suboccupies first place: is it infecting the American market of the credit cards?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that a few back fins swim thrilled around.
Today that the American market of the housing is in crisis, the predators have his looks put on the market of the country of the credit cards.
The analysts in Goldman Sachs calculate that the losses in credit cards can come to 99 million dollars if the crisis of the mortgages suboccupies first place it infects other credit forms of consumption.
Signs of contagion are already seen.
There is an increase both in the charges of cards and in the valuations of crime, which there measures the proportion of the balances that have not been amortized or that have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that has taken 1,4 millions of charge in his business of financing to the American consumer, partly due to the weakness of the borrowers of the cards.
Nevertheless, it is very early for the panic.
The slowness and the crime are in low levels.
In accordance with Moody's, an agency of qualification, the third trimester the valuation of crime of 3.89 % was an almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the valuations can be explained partly by technical factors.
A change in the American law of failure of the persons (2005) gave place to a sudden fall in the requests of failure, which in turn represent a big loss in credit cards; the number of requests (and therefore, of slowness) would be growing again, or it can happen that the conditions for the borrowers were deteriorating.
The industry also brings solid valuations of payment, which show how much of his debts the consumers pay every month.
And the confidence in the credit cards and the values endorsed by assets is quite firm, in spite of the palsy in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney de TowerGroup, an investigative signature, predicts that the volumes of emission for the year 2007 will be next to 25 % taller than last year.
The direct channels of infection of the crisis between the mortgages suboccupy first place and the market of the credit cards truly exists: the consumers are desirable to load the debts on the credit cards now when the credit entities are expiring.
But the issuers of the credit card look more at the flow of liquidity than the active values, so that the prices in fall do not drive necessarily a change in the capacity creditor of the borrowers.
They can even work to surpass the issuers.
The incentives so that the consumers keep on amortizing the mortgage it decreases if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; and as result, the payment of the debt of the card rises in the list of priorities.
The issuers of cards also can answer rapid and flexiblemente to the difficult conditions that the lenders of mortgage, changing types of interest or altering deserving balances.
That theoretically should reduce the risk of a rapid reappraisement of assets.
" We am not going to wake up one day and evaluate again all the loans ", says Gary Perlin, chief of capital finance One.
If a sudden infection of the subprime on the market of the credit cards is improbable, the risks of a supported descent are much more real.
If the prices of houses are lower and a contraction of the credit they push America to the recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a severer future.
It is necessary to keep on watching these back fins.
British bankers declared guilty in case Enron
Three British bankers who went to judgment for his responsibility in the frauds with the previous chief of the financial office of Enron, Andrew Fastow, they were declared culprits this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven charges of fraud for coludirse with Fastow in a financial secret operation in 2000 to prosper at the cost of the employees.
They were sent to judgment in January.
But during the hearing before the judge Ewing Werlein Jr of the district U.S, each one was sentenced as culprit of coslowworm in fraud.
Three ancient executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scotch group PLC in Royal Bank, turned into famous cause into Great Britain for the procedures of extradition that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the slack end of an investigation thrown after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were of having alerted in 2002 Fastow that was a target of a governmental investigation on the fall of Enron.
The accusation against the bankers - doubled "NatWest Tres" - it alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his previous top assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in the subsidiary one of a society of Enron controlled by Fastow, which was the maker of a myriad of frauds in Enron, which helped to his spiral of fall in the failure.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the daughter company in zero, but three Britons knew that it would value in rise.
A company under the control of Kopper million of dollars bought the interest of bank of the daughter company in 1 $.
The bankers paid to Kopper 250.000 dollars for interests in the above mentioned company.
According to the accusation, Fastow represented falsely Enron, since the energy company would pay 20 $ million to Greenwich NatWest on his parts of the daughter company.
But 20 millions stayed in hands of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 millions, while Fastow, Kopper and others received next to 12.3 millions, in accordance with the accusation.
In January, 2004, Fastow was sentenced culprit by two charges of conspiracy in the collapse of Enron.
The Britons' trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is fulfilling a judgment of 6 years in a federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper is executing a sentence of 3 years and one month in Texarkana.
Each of three British bankers must pay 1 million dollars that needed to live in the United States while the judgment was celebrated.
Enron, one of seven biggest companies of the nation declared in bankruptcy in December, 2001 after years of tricks in the accounting, might not hide the debt of millions or to make to seem successful his business that they trump.
The collapse made to lose thousands of jobs, more than 60 millions in values of market and more than two millions in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the previous executive chief, Jeffrey Skilling culprits were entrusted the years spent by his rolls in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is fulfilling a condemnation of more than 24 years.
The condemnation of Lay by conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Not below not out in Moscow
The price of a plane Gulfstream G550, equipped with an engine Rolls-Royce and sufficient aptitude of fuel to demolish directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, begins in 54 $ million dollars.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russian.
" It has capacity up to 18 passengers ", says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
" But none asks this model of so many seats because it is for private familiar flights or for presidents of a company ".
Mr. Firer was entrusted of the cabin of Gulfstream last Friday in the Fair of the Millionaire, a bacchanal of four days of consumption celebrated in a center of events in the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxurious providers had installed his stands of exhibition, hoping to attract the new wealthy Russian towards all kinds of products, from yachts artesonados in mahogany up to the broilers of cars incrusted with diamonds, you deign of 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at an orange brilliant Porsche in the nearby stand for his. "
" It is a beautiful car, but it is a nickel and change compared to us ", he said.
" After the United States, Russia is the second biggest market for the private planes. "
Supplied of fuel for the heyday of the oil, the Russian capital looks alike to Dallas when it was in climax.
" We live through the same in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen like materialistic ", says Marshall Goldman, teacher senior of the Center Davis for the Russian studies and eurasiáticos of the University of Harvard.

" Of course, the Russian is more interested in bling-bling. "
In fact, the sellers said that the rich Russian of more trajectory (10 to 15 years, for the Russian standards) has changed his pleasures from the showy logos to the marks of limited editions, which would not be exhibited in a trade fair.
Nevertheless, several thousands of persons: millionaires in cash, emissaries of the millionaires or tourists, fill the corridors every day.

Surgery " botched job " might be a cause of a death in New Jersey
It was the day before to Action of Thank you when Ronald Livingston looked across the window of the a little healthier " " restaurant and saw how an ambulance rose for White Cape Cod, two doors further down in avenue West Scott.
Suddenly, there appeared a car of the patrol of the police officer.
And later other.
" Then I saw raising the ambulance ", said Mr. Livingston, supervisor of the restaurant, this day Wednesday.
" There it was when I knew that someone had died. "
The authorities knew that the dead woman was 41-year-old Olga Arroyo, assistant of the director of the department of the police officer of Newark.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure realized by a plastic not authorized surgeon, which is still not identified by the police, but which is employed at the house of 212 of the Av. West Scott.
The authorities do not determine yet what caused the death of the sra. Creek, but they wait to the toxicological test although the results will not be available up to a few weeks. It will help to solve the mysterious death that it has grieved to the top lines of the police officer of Newark.
Missis Arroyo had been an assistant of the director of the police officer, Garry F. McCarthy, from September, 2006, and his voice was familiar to many in the department.
" She was loyal, hard-working and tenacious ", says Mr. McCarthy on Creek in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
" She was my guard ".
She was protecting me ".
Mr. McCarthy said that Creek was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, an ex-official of police officer of Newark that works for the Commission of Control of the Alcoholic Drinks, and that stopped two 14 and 11-year-old sons, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman of the district attorney of the Union of the County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives are trying to determine if missis Arroyo died immediately after a surgical not authorized procedure.
" This is one of the possibilities, " he declared Walsh.
" It is a current investigation. "
The authorities said that they came the house next to 3 P.M.
Of November 21 and they found missis Arroyo in a couch.
She was declared a deceased in the place.
More than one week has happened and the authorities have said little of his investigation or on the proprietor of the house, so-called Flower Margarita Castro.
Missis Walsh might not say if missis Castro has been interrogated by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine what part of the house was used as medical consultation.
On Wednesday, nobody answered to the door in the hearth of missis Castro, where a withered rosebush is located in the front part of the house, and a dálmata barks in the later part.
A blue drum labelled like " vainillina ethyl " - used as substitute for the vanilla in food and perfumes - was in the door of the garage, next to a door that he leads to the cellar.
Two mountain bicycles hang by hooks aside.
Mr. McCarthy said that when it came to Newark after 25 years in the department of the police officer of New York, missis Arroyo was of an inestimable help to know the new insular city and his rough political culture.
" She would say, " you have to watch with this one or that one ", he said.
" She was always here when I was, and also when not.
It is awkward. "
It is hoped that the federal reservation will cut the valuations away to raise the Stock Exchange
The actions jumped on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean yesterday after the market was hoping that the federal reservation should calm the credit conditions with courts to the valuations of interest, which increased with the calming comments of the vice-president of the central bank of the USA.
The bags came loose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, president of the reservation, was declaring that the stewards of political must be " flexible and pragmatic " in answering to the continued tension of the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm the markets in the middle of increasing samples of credit bags, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulency was " partly invested by the progress on the market at the end of September and during October ".
If the tendency was persisting to the rise, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate agencies and business, said Kohn.
The comments were taken by the investors as a sign of that the reservation is ready to inject fresh capital on the markets of EE.UU and to do later courts of the type of interest, to stabilize the conditions of the credit.
The remarks also helped to calm Wall Street in the middle of bad news for the economy of the EE.UU, as the selling of houses that reached the record lowest in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulency it was accentuated by a notice of Bear Stearns, investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, which is equivalent to 4 % of his entire labour, in a global reduction of costs to compensate the losses of his investments in the mortgages sub-occupy first place of the USA.
It is hoped that only 20 of these positions should enter London, where the bank uses 1.500 persons.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones raised in 331 points, or 2.55 %, to the closing 13.289.40, whereas the wide index S*P 500 raised 2.65 %.
In London, the index FTSE 100 raised 165.5 points, or 2.7 %, to the closing to 6.306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds sterling to the value of the companies of the first order of Great Britain.
The index Dax of Germany raised 2.6 %, and CAC40 of France it was on 2.3 %.
Earlier, one emphasized the reappearance of the tension of the credit on the markets after a strong demand in an auction of funds to three months of the Central Bank of Europe, which considered these loans to the commercial European banks in 4.7 %, the highest tariff from April, 2001.
The pressure to the Bank of England to continue the performance of the federal reservation and the ECB and to inject funds extra on the stock markets in London, they tensed the credit and the valuations of the loans to three months " Libor " between the British banks, the biggest rise meant it from September, of 6.59 %, after a constant increase from November 12.
England takes with judgment the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here there are two quandaries, each one so difficult as other.
Who must strike to the Nº 6 for England in Kandy this weekend: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important opposite to the first test against Sri Lanka: who must take the decision?
The second question is excellent because David Graveney, the president of the selection who is in loan - with this particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the trainer, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the office of Hugh Morris, the director of the England, it begins to fill with offers to turn into national selector, and if not, in one part stole.
The one that does not obtain the sixth place of bat will be unfortunate, but the life often is unjust and the sport also.
It is not easy to throw what a man does in the top of his profession, while other never goes beyond the low level, sometimes for lack of luck more than for capacity.
Not only in the cricket the election is difficult, since there are needed judgments that always end up by being subjective.
Is it the just time so that Bopara gets up?
Is it just for Shah if he does it?
The same question might do in another aspect if, John Edwards or " Tubby " Banerjee says, two brilliant executive young people with good grades and that know well the business, it was to be promoted to the board: only there is place for one of them.
Who must say what a good level is for a player of cricket, unless they give him the occasion to sink or to swim to the following chance?
The figures naturally have the big one it influences in the decisions, but this way also they have opportunities.
Inside a team, a player of cricket has to receive the eye of the captain at the same time of taking a wicket and a batsman to obtain opportunities to change the order if it wants to have impact as player some day.
But to receive the eye of the seleccionadores is more complicated.
There were many that improved the past period, for example, James Anderson, who plays surely in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself for fit and bowls as the wind in the networks.
Anderson took 32 wickets of the first class in 33 careers for each one to gain a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 in the same average, but both have had his high moments and can more of these wait.
The games of Shah or Bopara in the stadium of Asgiriya can be only a question of opinion.
The option can break or do the career of a man, or can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and did it well in the first ones, with 5 wickets and 40 useful careers, but he was Paul Collingwood, fighting settling at the same time the one who went so far as to turn into a player of importance, and in spite of noting down a double hundred against Australia in Australia, it can be still underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion in the today meeting in the stadium of Asgiriya, will continue his instincts of conservation and will favor the biggest experience of Shah for on the exhuberancia of the young man Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favor of Shah there is his brilliant and valuable test of debut of beginning of 88 in Bombay, 32 hundreds of the first class opposite to only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent antedecentes against the spin bowling.
Pero Shah did only ten careers in his two turns in May against West the Indies in the test in Lords, his house as player of the Middlesex, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the following meeting, it seemed to have taken of his batting something of élan than in Bombay.
On the contrary, the team of Essex has joie of vivre in swords.
He catches fire for nothing in the field of cricket and his attitude was summed up as when it overturned his vehicle in an exhibition for the sponsor of cars of the England, Volkswagen.
He suffered injuries of minor importance and, presumably a shock, but the first thing that it did was to extract his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and to call Alastair Cook, his team-mate who was looking at the distance, to say to him with excitement: " Does it dress that? ".
Bopara is the best player, it is including his slippery pass to have effects in his moves that seem to satisfy it, since flatcar with confidence and skill.
To choose the suitable man is a thing, to choose the best moment, other one.
Perhaps this is the real art of the selection.
My inclination would be to give to Bopara his opportunity, which he does not want to say that Shah should not stand out, as they suggest the tea leaves, he is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring the refugees back to the work - and to the struggle against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees of Syria began to come to Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who remained without cash, without extensions of the visa and whom they were waiting that the city should return to the normality.
Some of them even had returned to fight against the militants who led them out of his hearths.
At the station of buses of Mansour, even before the arrival of 800 persons from Damascus in an official convoy of the government consisted of a dozen of buses, the terminal was full of refugees of Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
" I decided to go to Syria after they were killing many doctors in Baghdad, " Sabah says to the-Qubaisi, doctor sunita.
" I returned today for what I saw in the TV and what I have read in the newspapers, on the events in Baghdad and that is sure now ".
" They say that the army of Mahdi stopped killing the people ", he declares, referring to the militia chiíta from the religious militant Cleric Moqtada to the-Sadr, which arranged to his troops a momentary cessation.
Qassim to the Atwani, chiíta of 38 years and teacher in the area sunita of Amariyah, returned with his two sons because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria since the diet does not love the Iraqis working in his country.
His neighbors chiítas in Amariyah called it by phone to say to him that an allied force of EE.UU helped to extract Al-Qaeda out of his bastion to the west of the capital, and they it pressed to that it was returning.
One of the newly come ones of Jordan was the chief of a tribe sunita and chiíta that it had been led from his hearth in Sleikh to the north of Baghdad, for an attack of grenades, later that urged the citizens to get up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
" Two days ago, some of my friends called me and said to me that Al-Qaeda had begun a militia anti in Sleikh and that they needed from my support and that of my partners ".
" That's why I have returned today ", he declared Sabaah Alu Obeidi, of 62 years.
Many people said to be attracted by the increasing calmness in the capital since the troops of EE.UU were strengthening groups of " worried citizens ", armed and that they are employed at cooperation with the military men of the USA to defend his local communities.
But many people declared to have returned for the refusal of the visas and the absence of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis settled in the last years.
Salaam to the-Samarrai, of 51 years and father of three sons, gave voice to the common suspicion between the exiles, that Nouri, the prime minister chiíta, asked the-Maliki the Syrian government to impose restrictions to the visas of the refugees to force the persons to return.
More than two and way millions of persons are thinking about having fled of the country because of the sectarian bands of the death.
" We were well until to the-Maliki he visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq ", said the sunita.
" I cannot believe in a government that supports the criminals who set fire to my house later that I left her ".
Part of the reason of the cessation of the violence is that the sunitas have been expelled from the zones chiítas and vice versa, relaxing the tension.
There exists the fear from which a refugees' sudden wave makes to arise again the sectarian tensions and begins the struggle.
The small Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first one in the professional training and it even shines for the international orientation of his top schools.
Like in the whole country, the sarlandeses lack only an educational field.
" Yesterday I told for fiftieth time to a not sarlandés that we are not franseses " - this was the motorbike ironically on if same of the smallest federal state for his cencuentenario.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a big role in the educational system of the Sarre that in a study of the Institute of the German Economy (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" occupied the fifth place.
This way, the top schools as tradition have good relations with the nearby countries.
The university of Saarbrücken was melted in 1948 by the franseses.
Up to today the students can finish here his university education with two or three dipolmas.
For consequence, the procentaje of the foreign students is high, of 15, 6 for hundreds.
Nevertheless, the number of students provenientes of the Sarre is superior to the average in the top schools. Many of them do not have a bacillerato.
" In the Sarre he takes advantage of the system of the professional education ", says Axel Plünnecke, the experte of educational sector in the Institute of the German Economy (IW).
More of every five young people it does his baccalaureate in the Professional School. This way, it turns out that the Sarre is 7 points per cent over the national average.
On the contrary, the variety the fan of possibilities for an education professional - academician is very wide.
The offering of the double careers, in relation to the number of population, is the best second in Germany.
In spite of the practical professional training and an increasing demand, the number of licentiates in Sciences of Engineering lowered a third in the last years.
This was the reason for which the Department of Education of the Sarre forced to the top schools to do more publicity for the specialities in Sciences of Engineering.
" After the first study of PISA, we realize some reforms in the schools of general education ", affirms a spokeswoman of the Department of Education.
This way the government introduced comparative tests in the whole country.
So that the children start studying as soon as possible last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", this one does not have any cost. Meanwhile, this model they imitate also other federal estades.
The comparison with the next studies will show if it has increased the yield of the pupils.
According to formless PISA of the year 2003, the number of pupils slowed down in school development desminuyó of 29 to 20 per cent.
But, in general, the Sarre did not improve very much as other federal states.
In Baviera, the pupils can calculate better.
For grief of the sarlandeses, formless PISA does not compare the knowledge of the foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although the sarlandeses are not French, the language of the neighbors is an obligatory subject in the Institutes of Secondary education.
Chávez changes the hour.
Póximamente in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9 the president Hugo Chávez allows to modify the schedule in the South American country slowing down the clock average hour.
At present Chávez is staying as a comic in Spain.
Since he has informed the Official Bulletin of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the hour will spend at least four hours GMT.
This way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Between other things Chávez, as enemy of the United States, it justifies his desición saying that the United States should impose in his day the obligation to the world on having changed a finished hour.
Also, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez he announced the rupture of the relations with his nearby country Colombia because of the action with capture of hostages.
The nationalist of left sides said that it would support no relation neither with the head of state nor with the Colombian government until the conservative Alvaro Uribe kept on being the president of Colombia.
" My dignity does not allow me to do it ", says Chávez, which is driving forward a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil-bearing country must decide on Sunday about a referendúm.
With this reform it might extend enough his power in the country.
The reason of the conflict was the desición thought by Uribe on having withdrawn the order of Chávez in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas in which it was a question of the liberation of the hostages.
On Sunday Chávez said criticizing that the decision that Uribe took has offended Venezuela.
Also in Spain one speaks very much on Chávez.
A new tone of so-called cause sensation in the country: " Why do not you keep silent about yourself? ", it is the phrase that half a million persons have already unloaded.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain who felt annoying for you continue interrupcciones on the part of the populist ones of left sides in the last Latin-American Summit.
In 2007 the decrease of the real salary threatens the Germans.
According to a prognosis, this year a decrease of the real salary threatens the German employees in spite of a strong conjuncture.
The experts present a big quantity of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
In accordance with the calculations of the Foundation Hans Böckler, the German employees should be provided in the year 2007 with a real account - salary lower than the previous year.
" The fault of that is the weak evolution of the wages, the increase of the value-added tax and the tug of the prices of the food and of the energy ", he was informing to the newspaper " Bild " Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Investigation of the economic cycles.
Also the new charges of the insurance of unemployment can correspond to the employees.
The Minister of Finance Peter Setinbrück said to periodic " Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung " that given the current situation, the intention of diminishing the load of insurance of unemployment 3.3 % on having happened from one year to other, turns out to be just and reasonable.
Naturally, the office of work does not have to get again into a disagreeable situation, asking the Federal State for credits and subsidies, according to the words of a politician of the divided German social democrat.
Tuesday became a public that the valuation of inflation with the explosion of prices in the sector of food and the sector of derivatives of oil reached the highest level for 13 years.
On having compared the prices with last year, these are increasing 3 %.
Venus: I join cufflinks of the Earth.
In spite of his ambience it is not adapted for the life, Venus is the planet most similar to the Earth, something that till now had not appeared. The European probe " Venus Express " discovered beams in the ambience and maelstrom in the poles, the same ones that appear also in winter in the Earth.
Already for three decades the investigators had the suspicion that beams could exist in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new tests: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the ambience. In Venus the beams cayen of a height of 54 kilometers of a cloud and behind other one, tells Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific magazine " Nature ".
According to the famous model of the origin of the life of Urey-Miller, the beams caused the life in the Earth: the storms could have provoked reactions in the ocean that, for his{your} part, they had caused the amino acids that are the basic components of the life.
In Venus it is not like that: if some day there was life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution ", tells Sean Solomon of the Institution Carnegie of Washington.
Today, in the surface of Venus there cannot be life: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times major that in the Earth and in the surface they reign temperatures of 500°C, ranging in such a way that temperatures could be reached under zero.
" Possibly, Venus is a "diabolical" twin of the Earth, but he keeps on being a twin ", said Russell.
The principal target of the mission " Venus Express " is to answer to the question of for what Venus so similar to the Earth for his mass and size, it has had such a different evolution.
Since from the nineties there were no special missions, only for investigation of this planet, the throwing of "Venus-Express" in November, 2005 was a very important step for the investigation of Venus.
The last results of the investigations that are going to be presented in many articles of "Nature", according to the opinion of the investigators, underline not only the unicidad of Venus in the Solar System.
" This desmuestra also that the nearby planets have more common characteristics with the Earth of which we had supposed ", reports THAT ONE.
In spite of the already well-known stormy winds in the North Pole, the investigators discovered in the polar south region also a whirlpool formed by the clouds that turns more rapid.
This phenomenon resembles the wind flows in the high atmospheric terrestrial layers of the poles, as there describes a team of investigators of Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Spatial Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the almost equal mass to the Earth and with his equatorial diameter of 12.000 kilometers it turns out to be almost so big.
This planet also called star of dawn or star vespertina orbits about the Sun almost 225 days.
But his period of rotation is slower: one day in Venus is equivalent to 243 days in the Earth.
Although Venus with his superficial temperatures of 460 grades and with his atmospheric pressure of 92 bars is not alike very much to the Earth, the scientists depart from the base of which both planets had formed in the same conditions.
In two planets there had agglomerated water that in the Earth remained in the oceans, but in Venus it dissociated in the universe.
Whereas in the Earth the dioxide of carbon had turned into stones of carbon, in Venus it forms most of the ambience.
Koehler defended the meeting of Merkel with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of Dalai Lama on the Federal Chancellery.
He criticized indirectly the Divided German social democrat for his attacks to the Federal Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, worries for the reputation of Germany and that's why it was required that the big coalition should finish this fight for the reception of Dalai Lama.
" In this case we must not present oneself as A divided nation ", said Koehler to the newspaper " Handelsblatt ".
At the same time Koehler showed his comprehension with regard to the reception of Dalai Lama for Ángela Merkel (Party of the Union Demócratacristiana) in September.
" Although I have a big respect to the difference between cultures, the human rights are of absolute validity for me ", said Koehler.
Everybody knows that Germany has to act with big balance in meteria of the exterior politics, underlines the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach that received on having realized a political piece of news with China.
" The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance of the traditional course of the politics of Una China.
China also knows it ", said Koehler.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Secretary of State (Divided social democrat), had showed indirectly his grief for the reception of Dalai Lama and because of it it was attacked by the members of the Union.
Between other things, Steinmeier criticized to the Union for his inoperative politics in the exterior matter.
The reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery Chinese - German provoked big incomprehensions in the relations.
This way, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation from Peer Steinbrueck (Divided social democrat), the Minister of Finance of Germany, but also, according to informative sources of the magazine " Spiegel ", it froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the Exterior State Departments of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chief of Chinese Government, demanded the Federal Chancellor Ángela Merkel that he should recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as an error.
Affirming the position of China, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept that the European politicians were receiving the religious leader of the tibetanos in his official position.
The actions and the words of Dalai Lama were demonstrating that it is trying to divide the Tibet and another region tibetana of China, which now includes also other provinces.

In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The performance much far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, it demonstrates that the coalition as for the content came to his last point and that any more of she is not necessary to wait for anything.
But in what country does the Chancellor live really?
After his exasperating performance, indifferent and without much contained in the general debate of the Lower House it is necessary to say: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As for the reproach that did him to him for having devoted itself reiteratedly to performances in exterior politics, the Chancellor pushed it back with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that this would be a provincial way and this way it showed made to state that it does not want to understand what the critics are interested in.
In the Lower House one declared from very clear express form to all that this reproach was suitable.
It was possible to feel either a minimal interest, nor any type of feeling for the problems of the country.
But instead of that, Ángela Wolke presented himself this way: a very high politics that flees in the exterior politics and remains there without achieving anything in particular.
An example: the prevention of the climatic change: he boasted very much to yes same for the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but he does not say anything about how these goals must be realized here in questions of climate.
In general, this way of boasting to yes same - for two years the chief of the Party of the Union Demócratocristiana could not have allowed so many modesty.
Since it gets involved in expressions so that an impulse comes to the people.
And this way it damages his public image for the pragmatic conception with the one that solves the problems without going away for the branches.
But in the kingdom of Ángela Wolke the interior problems perform aparencias little value.
The poverty of the children and the worries for the workpeople with low wages?
The only thing that one dedicates there is to speaking on this topic using subordinated prayers.
It is impressive how many times he is wrong on having spoken when it is a question of the supplement for the children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good phrase.
It starts stumbling " as if it had been in an unknown territory ", when it was a question of more concrete information.
The section attack.
Two favorites, Rudy Giuliani y Mitt Romney, did a clash in a heated debate of presidential republican precandidates of YouTube and now they must be afraid only of a candidate of the exterior part.
Already from a beginning the candidates notice the tensions between.
Mitt Romney reproached his adversary Rudy Giuliani that this one had turned New York in " a place of refuge for the illegal immigrants ".
This one, for his{your} part, he answered with serious reproaches: " He should to say that its own house was a "port" for the illegal ones ". Giuliani answers to ex--governador of Massachustes saying that it was who used the illegal immigrants without roles.
The candidates tend to the attacks: as till now the group of republicans does not have a clear favorite, eight presidential precandidates make use of the debate in the CNN, especially to discredit his adversaries.
The small videos of 30 seconds, requested for usarios of Internet that they were sent to Youtube, do not have great content either.
" With this way of isolation we allow Hitler to come to the power ", this was the reproach of John McCain to his adversary Ron Paul, the only one of the meeting that insisted on withdrawing immediately the troops of Iraq.
Romney receives also many critiques on the part of the veterans of the war in Vietnam, when he refuses to recognize like tortures the "Waterboarding", a method of examination, on having allowed to suffocate a person, they simulate his death.
The reactions of the public in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida shows that meanwhile the most important topics of the campaign are different, not only the war in Iraq or the debates on the torture.
The public always applauded very loudly when they were praising the conserving values and were denying the increase of the taxes.
This way it is possible to see better where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
" In that epoch I was wrong ", tells apologetic Romney and apologizes to the people and to the public of the television for having been a defender of the abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when they asked what was thinking about the literal interpretation of the bible.
For the first time Musharraf governs without uniform.
One day after his resignation as chief of the army, the president Pakistani made to be sworn as president.

The founders of Krautrock return.
The most famous German band of the 70s continues his activity: three members of "Harmonia" took part in a concert in Berlin.
As rerun did to itself a copy of " Live 1974 " that was written in the best epoch of the band.
Already in those times they were very famous in foreign countries.
The assistance of these three gentlemen to an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has in front of yes his box, his cables and especially his buttons.
In the way there is seated Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
To his left side there is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his portable computer and the guitar.
To the right hand, looking of the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Rodelius is, 73 years of age, which is very busy with the panel of control panel.
Each one contributes with his sounds, between them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds turn into a piece of music.
It seems that this does not bother to the gentlemen.
Slightly very exciting for excited of Krautrock it was the fact that the band Harmonia doing music again.
What it is necessary to reveal here is the following thing: the questions exactly have showed that the name of the band was resounding in the mind of the people, but it was not anything so special as so that after 32 years the public was missing her so much.
But why cannot the Germans applaud also to his alive legend of the seventies?
Especially because the ambiguity Kautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in your own country.
When the industry of entertainment granted a music award Dog "Threw" to the members of the band 2003 of Cologne for his work of life, in the room there could be seen the faces been surprised at the German artists of pop.
And when Network Hot Chili Peppers was grateful to the band The Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened the mouth wonderingly.
Later Michael Rother was spending the time in the stage during the concerts of Network Hot Chili Peppers as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
The ignorance in his country and the recognition abroad, they are only one thing.
It turns out to be a problem to resemble this band, because the trio only existed two years and in those times I do not achieve a big effect in the public, nevertheless, it obtained it with posteriority thanks to others.
Already a time ago Moebius and Roedelius had done music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, who was promising great reputation.
At first they were touching in the cellar of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Later, for economic reasons, they were employed with a company of music at Duesseldorf that was patronizada for a church.
During a time, Rother had a trabajillo in Kraftwerk and later it was employed of guitarist at the band Neu! It managed to improve the reputation of this German band that in those times was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in the exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruin of the XVIth century, they were living as refugees of the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Comune I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
This was rather a life of artist full of surprises.
As they say, one day Harmonia de Ottenstein appeared a pennant of affiliation of singing in the garbage, which turned out to be a good name for the art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first albúm was called a " Musik von Harmonia " and the second one " Of Lux ".
Although the musical calm and simple age, the band had financial problems.
The life as artist was not alone to be known to yes same.
The CD " Live 1974 " was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that, in this recording almost 50 persons took part.
Of that time Rother expressed his desire to promote Harmonia and to do occasionally essays.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against the customs.
In 1975 the band announces his separation.
Rother finished put in topics of esoterism and assured his existence with álbumes as " Flammende Herzen ".
Cluster re-lived through the eighties and from this time it has had more success the one than had Harmonia.
The recording in direct of the albúm in Griessmer, it is necessary to be grateful for that to Groenemeyer.
His company of music Grienland put itself as goal to cultivate this proper German contribution to preserve it as the alive music.
As the work of Roedelius, also the band Neu! it was again a patrolling.
Harmonia's presentation as band takes place in the House of the Cultures of the World in Berlin.
The band was subsidized by public measurements of the festival Wordtronics.
There there is Julian Cope, English, the old punk and the author of the manual " Krautrock Sampler ".
There also there is present Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
This way, all the influences of Krautrock to the following music pop are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super band, one since it was empty.
The phrase of Brian Eno accompanied on the special full music the room: " This music is the only true music, to her him partenece the fúturo ".
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers in a farm.
The history of the development of the legend appears in the projections of black and white photos, where instruments are seen with cables.
In the fund there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do not do anything any more that to fix the microphones to the organ and to the battery to be able to produce a few extraordinary tones with the help of the devices of effects that they had constructed with their own Aragonese ones.
At present the electronic music is as well as it had to be.
Three persons who study in depth the skill.
But that does not change anything.
Under the guidance of Bárbara Morgenstern, in a musical ambience it coughs, it is rumoured and in a good moment of emphasis it is sung: " Aaaaaaaah! ".
Krautrock was always already a term of English origin.
But it was never a question of rock.
The origin of the genre was not looked in the blues, but in the schools of music (Dog), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing of the artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who here shouts: " 68! " also it is right, but now Harmonia preserves the calmness.
In the stage it is reflected very well on what is already clear.
Where does it begin and where does it finish the music?
That can break to one the nerves or to give a few rapid moments of luck.
Only more cynicism is absent to Richard Gere.
Two movies " The Hunting Party " and " Moerderischer Frieden " devote themselves again to the war in the Balkans.
But the two had no conviction great.
Or the concepts are fixed very much in actions and tirotes or two movies are demasiando exciting.
Richard Gere with his " The Hunting Party " cannot help in this case either.
To the beginning there was one good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the criminals of war, keep on hiding in the mountain of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the war of Bosnia, actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
Finally we had lost seen the most nice man of the eighties, because nobody wanted to see it after his agreeable roles and little importance in the movies for women and after many press conferences on the Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the movie " The Hunting Party - when a hunter turns what it chases " (why nowadays do the qualifications of the movies have to be so long and ludicrous?).
The movie has a wonderful presentation for the sight: in the fund, his reporter's role in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere might do, if the destination and the industry of the cinema had not been so compassionate with him. He was a man whose better times of the life they happened already, that as a monument of the ruin of his decline most of his delight was preserving till now.
" The Hunting Party ", in spite of this victory, together with "Moerderischer Frieden" that is the German production and also this week will be presented, they turn out to be only a series of movies without success on the war in the Balkans.
It is possible to narrate the movie " Moerderischer Frieden " briefly: it is a question of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) that they want to save to Serbian one from the freelances of Kosovo, one of them acts as very rapid and that takes him also to whom falls in love with her.
The sense of the movie gets lost for the actions and the shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbian ones are not presented once again as the guilty only ones.
The movie is like the German series " Alarm fuer Cobra 11 " without freeway, but in situation of war.
In the example of " The Hunting Party " it is possible to investigate, because actually there was never a good movie on the war in the Balkans.
In another moment, with another director and with another author of script (Richard Shepard in two charges), the history on the American reporters in the war who go away to detect a Serbian criminal of war called "fox", probably might be a new "Apocalypse Now".
This way, the histories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go away two times to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and every time it turns out to be a trip in madness.
A reason of the defeat of " The Hunting Party " is when to the beginning they present us to Simon Hunt, to him to whom they do not allow him to be simply a cynic with heart.
Not, the script foresees also a love affair with a Moslem bosnia that they are going to kill then.
Of that time " The Hunting Party " is much far from the reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with an impressive rapidity achieve what they could not achieve for five years the NATO, the CIA and all the hunters of heads of the world, which was to capture the criminal of war and to leave them to the bosnios musulmanos so that they were taking revenge for a just form.
It is so badly, that they give desire to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on the crimes against cinematic logic.
Nevertheless, the intention of the film is, in reality, one profondamente humanly.
The movie wants to condemn the fact that Karadži ć and Mladi ć is even free, and highlights that the Americans and the Frenchmen do not worry really of chasing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good thing and bad sound so similar, so that a very famous poem of Brecht is come to one to the head.
In this peoma it is a question of a mask of an Asian demon: " In the gandes wrinkles of his front I see, sharing the feelings with him, that five-peseta coin is to be a villain ".
In the movies as " The Hunting Party " there are also these demons but they demonstrate that five-peseta coin is to be good.
The problem consists not only of the genre of the movies of war of the Balkans.
Not long ago in a newspaper he published that all the movies on Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiasco.
It is possible to add also that there has never been a good movie on South Africa.
Almost always it costs a rule: when a star gets for a region of crisis or for the minefields, then something like "Rangoon" appears with Patricia Arguette, " To Another side of all borders " with Angelina Jolie or " Diamonds sangrientes " with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts happened in a brief time period.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood rolls a good movie on the holocaust taking as an example the movie " The list of Schindler ".
Some movies already need more time. The classic ones as the works on the war in Vietnam " The Deer Hunter ", " Apocalypse Now " or " Full Metal Jackett " in his times were not celebrated by unanimity as the masterpieces.
Nowadays perhaps let's know too much on world conflicts, and that's why in our times every slaughter (Massenmord) comes presented directly in two televisions in house.
And that is because the authors of script do not have the minor objection (that it is necessary for power) in narrating good histories.
" To be or not to be " or " The big dictator " they turned out to be in the end so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know yet that so bad the diet was actually Nazi.
Perhaps it should not to be a good person to roll a movie.
Perhaps it is necessary to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look of an artist.
When they asked him on the parallelisms between his historical novel " Dictionary of Lemprière " and the war in the Balkans, he answered: " That is due only to the fact that some things never change ".
The big cities will always be in danger, the men are always going to be murdered cruelly and in Yugoslavia he will always reign the war.
Von Beust receives as response the negative critique on the Olympian Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received many critiques of the politics and economy for not requesting the Olympian Summer games.
Many want to keep on fighting for the competitions in the section of aquatic sports.
Pero Beust remembers that it is necessary to be a realist on having estimated the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, general manager of the chamber of commerce of Hamburg, it showed on Wednesday this resignation as " not good for the economic emplacement ".
In the last time no other project in the big city encouraged so many motivation as the idea of the organization of the Olympian Games.
" Without this target it might not support the political, sports impulse at the same level ".
Schmidt-Trenz demanded from the senate not to forget this project, but to find a new application in the long term " that refers to another time ".
On Wednesday mayor Ole von Beust supported his declarations of which the ambitions of Hamburg in the organization of the Olympian Summer games were not realized until at least the year 2028.
" Hamburg does not decide on the request for the Olympian Games, but the German Federation of Olympian Sports decides it ", says von Beust in the WELT ONLINE.
He sent to the decision of the Federation of sport (Sportbund) that is waited at the beginning of December, on the request of Munich for the Olympian Winter games of 2028.
" This preference means for us that in this period of time, that till now we were thinking to have until 2028, from the realistic point of view we will not have any opportunity ".
In spite of all, this sleep did not finish forever, said von Beust.
The Federation of sport of Hamburg (HSB) is sorry about the declarations of von Beut.
This gives the impression of which in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to request the Olympian Games.
" It is too prompt to allow to remove the opportunity, if in this moment the plans are ruined ", said on Wednesday Günter Plo ß, the director of HSB.
A resignation of the request turns out to be contradictory to the declaration of the chief of the senate that it did in a reception owing to the general meeting of the public German Federation of sport of the top schools (adh).
There von Beust designated the request of Hamburg for Universiadas of 2015 not as " a substitution " of the Olympian Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Federation of sport of the top schools named Hamburg as a candidate of the request.
The Fraction of the Divided German social democrat (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) reproached to the senate that was not making use of such a valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
" For many years the senate was late with the development of the small quarter of Grasbrook, because this one was in plans for the Olympian Games or the construction of houses ", affirmed Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputies of the Divided German social democrat (SPD).
Whereas the SPD was always demanding an integrated planning of Olimpia for the small Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU was underlining the importance of entertainment.
In this moment, the request of Hamburg for the Olympian Summer games of 2012 provoked a big enthusiasm.
Pero Hamburgo failed because of Leipzig.
They are not the wooden boxes.
The one who relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, he thinks about Ikea, but he does not think about Andy Warhol.
Or yes?
At present the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shade that weighs on the list of works of Warhol.
Most of ninety-four Brillo-Box of "type" of this list is false.
After a few months ago the periodic Swedish " Expressen " was putting the doubt about the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968 of Andy Warhol, the museum Modern Museet of Stockholm realized internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: six "Brillo-Boxes", which the ex-director of the museum Pontus Hultén gave to the museum Modern Museet, is false, and almost a hundred of others of " type Stockholm ", which are in circulation on the market of the international art, prove also.
The prehistoric times are too complicated by a confused relation between the artistic productions and patrocionadas.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted the wooden boxes of red, blue and white, with the same sample that there had pasteboards of dust of soap I "Shine".
In accordance with Warhol, in the exhibition of his works of 1968 in the museum Modern Museet hundreds of Sheen - carton were exhibited. It did not make these Warhol (because of the expenses), but they were brought directly of the factory of pasteboard of "Sheen".
It was not a question of works of art, but of copies (that were only a few objects) exhibited.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden a few Wooden sheen - box, but they were not exhibited in the museum Modern Museet.
Witnesses of those times speak now of that almost fifteen boxes, which in that time entered the history of the art and of the subasta like original of the "Brillo-Boxes" of " type Stockholm " authorized Andy Warhol.
In some auctions of them they were bought by more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem is that after that the famous director of the museum Pontus Hultén was doing false declarations that in the year 1968 in Sweden were produced and exhibited almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left them to him.
But actually, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for exhibition in Saint Petersburg.
In this time Warhol had already died from hacía 3 years.
Lars Byström, the chief of the conservatives of the museum Modern Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes property of the museum and also three of the private Swedish property that were made in 1968 in Stockholm. First his tight silvers were printed and burnished and later they painted them to him to the oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of the year 1990 shows that the painting was applied by a roller without printing directly the tight silvers. Also it is not a question of the painting to the oil, but of the acrylic painting.
" These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be eliminated of the official list of Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol ", says Lars Nittve, the director of the museum Modern Museet and adds that if The Commission of Autentificación " Andy Warhol Art " in New York will not come to any conclusion, the museum Modern Museet will classify these six boxes as the copies / objects of exhibition ".
Already in Julio La Comisión de Autentificación he announced in a formal way that he accepts these " serious accusations " in which it is a question of boxes of dust of soap.
But from this moment there everything remained in silence absolute.
The rebellious soldiers give up in Manila.
In the Philippines there have given up the rebellious soldiers who had taken refuge in a hotel in Manila and had demanded the fall of the president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The ringleader Antonio Trillanes, who reproaches the president, the corruption and electoral fraud, said to a correspondent that he could not answer for spilling blood.
The soldiers faithful to the government had assaulted the hotel using tear-producing gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers were taking refuge for a few hours in the building.
Almost the half of them, between them Trillanes, had on Thursday judgment for having tried a coup d'état in the year 2003 that finished with in a defeat.
He made use of the negotiations, suddenly to be able to settle with approximately 30 sympathizers.
Clearly the military police officers who had to watch it had gone on to his lines and they continued his riot.
They entered the hotel " Peninsula " and demanded the fall of the president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The troops of the government blocked the quarter in the surroundings of the Noble Hotel.
The president called to an urgent meeting of the Office of Security.
Norberto Gonzales, the adviser of National Security, condemned the behavior of the soldiers.
" The people are full ", said Trillanes.
" We summon the people to go on to our lines ".
General Danilo Lim, who earlier was directing the troop of elite Scout Reangers, said that soon other military troops wanted to continue the march.
The big critics of government summoned on Thursday to a big declaration against the president.
For months his government gets reproaches for the corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a place that was attracting all the attention for the riot that was tried against Creek.
The raising failed after fence 24 hours for which the army wanted to take part.
From 1986 in the Philippines there have been at least seven attempts of coups d'état against the elected government of a democratic way.
Internet United will be the biggest shareholder of Versatel.
Internet United assured more than 20 per cent of the actions of the company of telecommunication Versatel.
On Wednesday the company informed that the average price for an action is 14, 46 euros.
There are had only 20,05 per cent of the social capital.
There were many speculations about the absorption of the company.
There are also the options for increasing more the financial part in Versatel.
Internet United informed that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German market of DSL (Line of digital subscriber).
On Wednesday they already did the assumptions on the entry in the business, after the bank Brendenberg increased his participation to the operator of network of Duesseldorf for 5 for hundreds to 15,1 for hundreds.
On the financial market that means that the financial institution supports the qualifications of participation for a third associate.
Internet United already in the previous day made to inform with almost 10 for hundreds the company of telecommunication Drillisch.
Drillisch in the measurement of increase in capital placed 17,4 million new actions that have a value for 106,4 million euros.
Internet United has bought of them 5,15 million actions for 31,4 million euros.
Also, the companies began with the negotiations on cooperations of commercialization of the DSL-products.
" We strengthen our collaboration ", told the potravoz of United Internet.
Two companies founded a together company MSP, to acquire the competitor Freenet.
On Thursday United Internet informed that to the beginning, two companies want to be satisfied with the participation of ten per cent to Freenet and do not make use of his right, that is to say, they make to inform 18,49 for hundreds of Freenet.
That was meaning that both companies supported all the options, especially the participation to the corporation Freenet.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic affiliation ended in the middle of November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and it is not very understandable it is a part of the consolidation of the German market of Telecom.
At the end of the third trimester Freenet it had 2,9 million clients with a contract of mobile phone and 1,27 millions with a contract of DSL or a finished contract.
Till now the holding of United Internet and Drillisch had directly 6,01 per cent of the participation in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch is going to achieve other four per cent.
The right to buy 18,49 per cent of the society of investment Vatas was already agreed in August.
